<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S KINGDOM, ruling the world in righteousness and peace, has long been the hope of all those who love righteousness and hate lawlessness. From the time that God said to Abraham, ‘In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,’ hope of that blessed time has been strong in the mind of faithful men. For centuries holy men of old looked for the coming of the Messiah, whom God would use to establish his righteous government on earth. More than nineteen centuries ago the angels of heaven dramatically announced the birth of Jesus, and that company of heavenly messengers, at the bidding of Jehovah, sung the anthem: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” —Luke 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thirty years after that memorable announcement the perfect man Jesus began his ministry on earth by making announcement in these words: ‘ ‘ The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” By that is understood that Jesus had been anointed by Jehovah God as and for the King of heaven and earth and that in due time he would rule the world in righteousness. For three and one-half years thereafter Jesus went about preaching the good news of God’s provision for man and teaching the people the way of righteousness. In his work Jesus was constantly opposed by the men who claimed to be serving God and who were at that time called the clergy, made up of priests, Pharisees and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sadducees. Their opposition to Jesus was due to the fact that, having undertaken to serve Jehovah God, they had become unfaithful and had fallen victims to the seductive influence of the Devil. For this reason Jesus said to them, in substance: ‘God is not your Father, but you are the children of the Devil, because you do what he desires.’ (John 8: 42-44) From that day till the present time every person who has faithfully followed in the footsteps of Jesus has been the object of Satai}’s attacks, and that visible opposition has been carried on chiefly by clergymen or those who claim to be representatives of God on earth. Jesus told his disciples it would be so and that such opposition would continue until the will of God is done on earth as it is done in heaven, and hence he taught them to pray for the coming of the Kingdom. (John 15:19, 20; Matt. 6: 9,10) The facts fully support that utterance of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly before his crucifixion Jesus told his disciples that he was going away and would receive the kingdom from Jehovah but that in due time he would come again and receive his faithful followers unto himself and set up his kingdom. For this cause the chief question in their minds and the one which they propounded to Jesus was: ‘What shall be the proof of thy coming or end of the world and the kingdom 1' (John 14:1-3; Matt. 24:1-7) After the resurrection of Jesus from the dead and his ascension into heaven the mind of each one of the apostles was illuminated and they discerned that the coming of Jesus Christ and the establishment of his kingdom was a long time in the future, and from that time they went about teaching the people who would hear, admonishing them to be faithful until the coming of the Lord. From the days of the apostles until the present time there have been faithful men and women on earth who have prayed and looked for the coming of Christ Jesus and the setting up of his kingdom of righteousness for the benefit of the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the year 1880 (A.D.) a few honest and sincere followers of Christ Jesus came together in Pennsylvania for the studying of the Scriptures, particularly with reference to the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. The result was that shortly thereafter a society was organized for the study and the proclamation of the truth of God’s Word. That Society was first named Zion’s Watch Tower Society. Later incorporated, its name was changed to that of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. It was incorporated that the work of these men and women in proclaiming the truth might be carried forward in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">lawful and orderly manner. Into this Society or organization came men and women from the various Catholic and Protestant church organizations in the land and there came also some from outside all church organizations. These faithful followers of Christ Jeans saw that the organizations on earth called ‘' churches” are in fact human organizations and that their forms of worship and doctrines are out of harmony with Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ. Having only one purpose in mind, these faithful ones then went about amongst the people, teaching them and instructing them concerning the second coming of Christ and his kingdom. Opposition to their work began at once, which opposition has at all times proceeded chiefly from priests, pastors and preachers of church organizations. Regardless of all opposition these faithful men and women have continued in their work of telling others concerning God and his gracious provision for the blessing of mankind as these truths are set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1909 it seemed proper that there should be formed a corporation under the laws of the State of New York to further the interest and the work above mentioned, and accordingly the Peoples Pulpit Association was organized. The same officers were elected to manage the corporation as those elected to manage the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, because the work of the two organizations is the same. This Christian missionary work progressed in America and outside thereof and it was deemed proper that a corporation be formed at London, England, and this was done in the year 1914 by the formation of the International Bible Students Association, being incorporated under the laws of Great Britain. These three corporations are one in fact, doing identically the same work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Jehovah continued to unfold the prophecies to his people and to make it more clearly appear to them what is his purpose, they saw that God has taken out from the nations of earth a ‘‘people for his name” and that those so taken out and separated from the world must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah. It was in the year 1931 that these faithful men and women saw that it is the will of God as expressed by the Scriptures that they should be called ‘‘Jehovah’s witnesses ’ ’, and for this reason they are today throughout the earth known and designated as ‘‘Jehovah’s witnesses”, and the aforementioned corporations carry on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as above stated. The chief objective and purpose of these witnesses is to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah, inform the people that he is the only true and almighty God, that Christ Jesus is his King, and that the kingdom of heaven is now at hand. This is the work they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Satan inaugurated his rebellion against Jehovah in Eden God sentenced him to destruction. However, because Satan had challenged God and defied him to put men on earth who under severe test would remain true and faithful to Jehovah and righteousness, and in order to permit proof to be made that Satan is wickedly wrong and that Jehovah God is always right and righteous, God said to Satan: ‘‘But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leaser)</span><span class="font5"> This explains why God has permitted wickedness in the earth for such a long period of time. Now the time has come for the great controversy, issue or question between Jehovah and the Adversary to be settled for ever, and it will be settled, as the Scriptures show, at the battle of Armageddon. Just before that great conflict Jehovah God commands his witnesses to go throughout the land and to make publication of his name and of his kingdom under Christ. It is to be expected that Satan and his agents would bitterly oppose this work of Jehovah’s witnesses; and it is even so. The witness work of advertising amongst the people the truth of Jehovah and his kingdom, and that it is the only hope of the world, continues to progress amidst great opposition from the enemy. The report that follows herein will enable you to see how that work is progressing, and what is being done by the enemy to interfere with it, and what you may expect in the near future. It is hoped that many who read this report will see that the conditions now obtaining on the earth are exactly what is to be expected and that, learning this in the light of the Scriptures, they may have hope for the future. The present unhappy conditions on earth will, as the Scriptures plainly show, culminate in the greatest tribulation ever known in the world. That will be the end of all trouble; and the great battle of Armageddon will be followed by the full and complete establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, and then lasting peace and prosperity will be on earth to stay and righteousness shall rule in every part of the earth. That will be the fulfilment of the angelic anthem of peace and good will sung 1900 years ago. May you study this report with profit to yourselves, and may you see your privilege to join in making known to others that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is the hope of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses scattered throughout the earth are merely advertising agents of the Eternal King and his kingdom. That does not at all mean that they are engaged in propaganda work. The generally accepted definition of propaganda is this: An organization for the propagation of a doctrine or system, the purpose of which is to cause the membership of the System or organization to increase or enlarge. Religious organizations engage in propaganda, because each system of religion tries to increase its membership. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses for his kingdom is entirely a different matter. The principles of Jehovah God are fixed, and never change, and Jehovah does not put forth an effort, nor authorize any creature to put forth an effort, to increase his organization or to propagate his doctrines. He furnishes the information to men to enable men to exercise their free will either to serve his kingdom of righteousness or to take the opposite course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The divine commission given to Jehovah’s witnesses is in these words: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. ’ ’—Isa. 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s chief purpose is the vindication of his name and to prove to all creation that he is supreme. “Zion” is the name given to his organization, including the faithful on earth who follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Concerning such he says: “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the [nations] shall see thy right* eousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” (Isa. 62:1, 2) The new name which he has given those devoted to him is ‘‘Jehovah’s witnesses”, and to them he says: ‘‘Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. ’ ’—Isa. 43:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has never made any attempt to convert the world, but he has merely taken out from the nations of the world a small number of persons whom he has commissioned to be his witnesses, and has Commanded them to make known to the rulers of the nations and to the people that Jehovah is the Supreme One; that Christ Jesus is his Chief Officer and earth’s rightful King; that he has enthroned Christ Jesus as King of the world, and he is the One who executes Jehovah God’s judgments of vengeance against the workers of iniquity. These judgments were written long ago and are directed against Satan and all who serve him. God has placed his King upon his throne, and his work now is to oust Satan and his organization, and then will follow in the earth complete peace and prosperity. Then all men who render themselves in obedience to God’s kingdom of righteousness will be given the opportunity for life everlasting. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, is merely to make known these truths, and if it pleases others to believe them and deport themselves accordingly, well and good for them; otherwise they fail to receive the benefits of God’s gracious arrangements. The testimony concerning God and his kingdom is contained in the Word of God, which is the Bible, and is the truth; and Jehovah’s witnesses are his agents or instruments to bear or bring this message of truth to others, that they may have an opportunity to know Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The proclamation of these truths brings no profit to Jehovah or to Christ Jesus, but for the people to know them is of vital importance, as it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) There is nothing that is of so great interest, convenience and public necessity as the truth of and concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The field for the work of Jehovah’s witnesses embraces the entire earth, but the chief part of their witness work must be done in the nations called ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ These nations, having assumed the name of the Lord, are in an implied covenant to do his will, and hence are in a more responsible position than the “heathen”. The Lord commands, therefore, that notice and warning shall be particularly given to the nations called “Christendom”. Within the borders of “Christendom” there are many persons of all nationalities. “Christendom” well corresponds to ancient Jerusalem, where the witness work was originally chiefly done, but which included other nationalities because of the cosmopolitan population there assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The main office of the Society conducting the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is situated at Brooklyn, New York. At the Brooklyn headquarters there are 196 persons jointly engaged in the work of the Society. These reside at 124 Columbia Heights and at the radio station on Staten Island, and all work as one family or organization. There are no bosses or masters amongst them, but all are on a common level. The relationship of master and servant does not exist. Expressed in commercial terms of this world, all of these persons are copartners, since each one has the same interest in the work. The organization and its work are such that each one has an assigned duty and that duty is performed by each one as unto the Lord, each one knowing that his responsibility for faithfulness is to Jehovah God and not to human creatures. This arrangement assures an efficiency in service that could not be had in any other way. No one receives any pecuniary profit in the operation of the Society’s work. Each and every one of the aforementioned workers has his or her board and lodging furnished by the Society, and in addition thereto each one receives the small allowance of fifteen dollars per month for clothing and other incidental expenses. Each one is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">witness for Jehovah, and therefore each one is a preacher of the gospel of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout America, and in fact throughout the earth, are likewise copartners, each one striving to get on with the work of witnessing for the Kingdom in obedience to the commandments of the Lord. Each pioneer or field worker who goes from house to house with the literature is a preacher of the gospel, and in no sense of the word is engaged in any commercial work. The publications of the Society are first for the instruction, aid and comfort of the workers. The publications contain the Scriptural message that is of help and comfort to all persons who have a desire to learn the truth and to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom. The field workers are not commercial salesmen, and they are not engaged in any commercial business or transaction whatsoever. Those in the Society’s work could not be hired for a money consideration to do the work that they are doing. Each one of them has made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">covenant or an agreement with Jehovah God to do His will and to obey His commandments, and since God commands them to tell His message of truth and commands them to go and tell it to others, they do so in obedience to His commandments. In doing this work they are not attempting to earn a living of earthly bread. Most of their work is done at a large money sacrifice. For these witnesses to engage in this work on a commercial basis would be a violation of their covenant with Jehovah God. They having agreed to obey the Lord God in doing this work, a failure to do the same on their part would mean the loss of everything to them, including life itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having become the followers of Christ Jesus, these witnesses of Jehovah are followers of Christ Jesus and are under the immediate command of the Lord Jesus Christ, God’s great Prophet of whom Moses was a type. They must hear and obey Christ Jesus, as it is written: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. ’’ (Acts 3: 22, 23) For this reason it is easy to be seen that it would be wholly inconsistent for these witnesses to ask permission of any earthly organization to engage in giving the testimony of and concerning God’s kingdom. The doctrines of and concerning the kingdom of God are set forth at pages twenty and following of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> of this organization of 1934, to which reference is here made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As long as this present world exists money will be used to measure the value of labor and other material things; hence it is needful to receive and pay out money in carrying on the work of the Society. The message of and concerning God’s kingdom is furnished and published as a means of transmitting the truth to the people who desire to hear it. Almost every person is more likely to read a book or paper if he has spent some money to obtain the same or contributed some money for the particular cause which that book or paper represents. The publications of the Society, therefore, are exhibited to the people, and the people are given an opportunity to contribute a small amount of money, which money is used exclusively to cany forward the educational, charitable and benevolent work of the Society. In the testimony delivered at the time of the exhibiting such books the witness names an amount that might be contributed. Where the persons to whom the testimony is given have no money, a less amount is taken, and often the books are given to them freely. Subscriptions are taken for the semimonthly magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> all of which money goes into the funds of the Society and is used to carry on its work No advertisements are carried by these publications, and hence there is no other source of revenue from them. Because the labor is furnished voluntarily, and because of the frugal and economical way in which Jehovah’s witnesses live, a great amount of work at a minimum cost or expenditure of money is carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year of the Society is from October 1 to the following September 30. For the year of 1934, ending September 30 of that year, the receipts and expenditures, briefly summed up, are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Money received for books, booklets,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bibles, transcription machines, phonographs, subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> total.....$527,744.31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total amount expended for raw material, manufacture of books, and advertising the gospel of the kingdom by radio, including field workers and the gift of books, to wit, the sum of......$677,699.73</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it will be seen that the amount of money received by reason of all its publications is far less than that expended and thus leaves a deficit for the year of $149,955.42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This deficit, however, is offset in the following manner: Companies of Jehovah’s witnesses in various parts of the country have paid in cash some accounts for the broadcasting of the message by radio, and these amounts have been credited to them by the Society as donations, and these amounts total $64,072.93. In addition thereto the Society has received by bequests and by unsolicited donations from persons desiring to further the work of the Lord’s kingdom, the total sum of $120,990.91. The above two items total $185,063.84. Subtracting therefrom the deficit of $149,955.42 leaves a cash balance on hand at the end of the year of $35,108.42 to proceed with the work for the ensuing year. The Society follows the policy of paying bills as it goes, and does not incur indebtedness, except the indebtedness on real estate, which is secured by mortgage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society maintains at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, New York, a printing and book-manufacturing plant, and all who serve there or at the Bethel home, where they are housed, do so voluntarily. They are not employees, but are coworkers in the Lord’s witness work. At the office and factory the message is translated into many languages, the proof is carefully read, type is set, plates made, and the printing done, and the books and other publications are prepared and sent out to the field workers to carry the message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year there was an average of 135 workers in the factory and office. Each one is given experience at at least two jobs in the office and factory and is shifted from one to the other as the occasion requires. The factory operates eight and one-half hours per day, on an average, except Saturday, when the operation is one-half day. Working days for the past twelve months total 268J. Twice during the year, because of greater demands for literature, the factory was operated for two hours in the evening, and during stated times there was an extra shift put on at night to meet the demand for literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The production at the factory during the fiscal year exceeds that of the previous year. Books and booklets were produced during the year to the number of 25,740,032. This is an average of more than two million per month. The greater amount of these pieces of literature was booklets, which shows an increase over the previous year of more than five million. The bound books are less than they were the preceding year. In addition to books and booklets produced at the factory, magazines, calendars, catalogues and folders were printed and sent out, reaching a grand total of 84,661,201 pieces. Of this number, forty-two million were folders used to advertise radio and transcription lectures. A brief comparison of the production for the fiscal year and the preceding year is set forth as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAW MATERIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to produce the foregoing the Society must first provide the raw material. Before purchasing such raw material our purchasing department carefully examines and checks the various products, and contracts for the same in large quantities and at the lowest possible rate. During the year, for its publications the Society required 2,081 tons of paper. Ink made in our own factory, 36,794 pounds. In addition thereto it produced the paint to keep the property of the Society in preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MECHANICAL DEVICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has found it advantageous in advertising the Kingdom message to use transcription machines and phonographs, and these are called mechanical sound devices for preaching the gospel. The factory force at 117 Adams Street, for a portion of the time during the year, has been engaged in manufacturing these sound machines in order that they might be produced and placed in the hands of the workers at the least possible cost. These machines the Society has paid for, of course, and furnished many of the field workers with them, while other field workers have contributed money to help pay for such machines; and companies have contributed money that they might have a machine for the reproduction of lectures in their respective vicinities. During the year there have been manufactured transcription machines to the number of 258, with microphone attachments to the number of 100; phonographs, to the number of 1,245. Tha cost of this is included in the expenditures mentioned aforesaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MACHINERY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is needful from time to time to replace the machinery for this manufacturing work, also to provide trucks and automobiles for the transmission to the shipping points and for the distribution of literature in the field and for preaching the gospel by going from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY AT BETHEL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The entire company of 196 persons hereinbefore mentioned constitute the family of Bethel, meaning the “House of God”. They come from different parts of the country, having heretofore engaged in various vocations, but at the Bethel all are engaged in one common cause of preaching the gospel of God's kingdom. All those working at the factory are provided with room, board and other accommodations at 124 Columbia Heights, the Bethel home. During the year there have been six separate and distinct periods set aside for special witness work, in which the Bethel family has participated; and for the purpose of permitting them to have this opportunity at stated times the factory, office and home have been closed. Other field workers will be interested to know that during the year those constituting the Bethel family, and who have been able to participate in the special field service, have done so, and their work is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Number of workers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,516</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58,801</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total books and booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60,317</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In connection with this part of the work an automobile for the transcription machine has been used during three months of the year. In that time 67 meetings have been held; 107 lectures given. This has been an added means of getting the message to the people in and about the city of New York. During the year men were sent out from the Bethel family to serve companies in other places, to the number of 184.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCOMMODATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In furnishing necessary accommodations of room and food for the Bethel family the Society provides an orderly arrangement. The position of supply steward is maintained, whose duties are to see that food is provided and brought into the family for preparation and consumption. To supply such food the Society maintains and operates a garden on its property on Staten Island, where vegetables are produced for the benefit of the family; also a place in Florida, where vegetables are likewise produced for the family during the winter. The object is to supply the Bethel family with food at the most economical price and which at the same time is healthful and for their best physical welfare. The Society also provides a maintenance steward, whose business is to look after the maintenance of the property and to see that the material is furnished for repairs in keeping the property in condition. All this work is done voluntarily by those who are devoted to the Lord and his kingdom cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SHIPMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Brooklyn factory manufactures books, booklets and other literature, not only for the United States, but for Canada, Great Britain, South Africa, Australia, and other places. Books dispatched or shipped from the Brooklyn office during the year exceed that of any previous year, total shipment amounting to 23,053,126 volumes. These were sent out in many different languages and to many parts of the earth. In shipments this is an increase over the previous year of 3,440,609. A more detailed statement of these shipments is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Branch Offices Companies Pioneers Auxiliaries Miscellaneous</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">«,550,181 8,953,531 4,451,466 914,787 183,161</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">23,053,126</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Total</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To facilitate the shipment for distribution within the borders of the United States and adjoining territory the Society maintains depots at Los Angeles, Seattle, and St. Louis, the depot formerly maintained at Oakland, California, being moved from there to Los Angeles. Shipments from the Brooklyn factory are made in carload lots or large consignments to these respective depots and from there reshipped for distribution amongst the people. As the commercial depression increases, the demand from the people for literature concerning God’s kingdom increases. Otherwise stated, many sober-minded persons desire to know more about God’s purposes and hence avail themselves of the opportunity to read the Scriptural helps provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By way of comparison, the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> had the widest circulation during the year and hence the largest amount shipped from the factory. This indicates that many more people are anxious to know what the preparation for Armageddon means, and there is only one way to find the correct explanation, and that is in the Scriptures, and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> helps to understand the Scriptures on this point in particular. The greater demand for booklets is due to the fact that many persons are not able to provide themselves with all the books and they feel too independent to permit the same to be given to them. Their desire is to help as far as they can to get the message to the people. When it is considered that the publications were issued in 38 different languages from the Brooklyn office this year, and all together, English and foreign, 171 different publications issued and shipped to every part of the earth, one may have some conception of the work that must be done in order to get this message of the Kingdom to the people. In addition to the books manufactured and shipped from the Brooklyn factory, Bibles to the number of 20,726 have been sent out. This shows a healthy increase amongst the people desiring to know more about God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the foregoing shipment of books and booklets the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine were printed and made ready and placed in the mails to the number of 3,738,545; also catalogues, placards, calendars, radio and transcription folders and other material that was manufactured and shipped; also the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> prepared and shipped out. In addition to this, transcription and phonograph machines were manufactured and shipped. The packing and shipping entail a lot of work, and the furnishing and packing of cartons, books and other material that is used for shipment. The shipping charges alone during the year cost the Society approximately $100,000.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By way of illustrating the efficiency and the zeal put forth by the brethren in the office, who manufacture these books and booklets, the following is stated: The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine</span><span class="font5"> copy was furnished on August 12. This, of course, had to be proofread, set in type, made up into pages and the manufacture begun, and on September 5 the first order of three million was completed and on the way to the different parts of the country. Of course, this was an extra rush in order to get the booklet into the hands of the people before the “union prayer meeting of the clergy and distinguished men’’ began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the English publications shipped from the Brooklyn office during the year there were also shipped in foreign languages the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief work of Jehovah’s witnesses is the publication of the gospel or good news of the Kingdom. This is done in obedience to God’s commandments. To his witnesses Jehovah says: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God; go and tell the people. ’ (Isa. 43:10,12; 6:9) Jesus and his disciples did that very thing. All of his true followers must do likewise, because these are called to walk in his steps. (1 Pet. 2:21) Everyone who becomes a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ must obey his commandments. Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, and concerning the Lord Jesus Christ God caused Moses to declare and afterward the apostle Peter to repeat: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:22,23) Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, have no alternative. If they would please the Lord God and receive his approval they must obey the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amongst the commandments is the following: &quot;And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) This latter commandment especially applies to the present time and must be performed now by everyone who is of Jehovah’s capital organization. That Jehovah’s witnesses are doing today exactly what Jesus and the apostles did is shown by the following scriptures as recorded in Luke 9:1-6 and in Acts 20: 20. Jesus sent forth his disciples to preach the gospel from house to house, and in obedience to his commandments, as stated by the apostle Paul, they went from house to house telling the people concerning God and his kingdom. Now the time has come when the world has ended, and this good news of the Kingdom must be proclaimed to the people, and the Lord has commanded that it shall be published to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books must first be manufactured before they can be published. Publication means notification to the people either by words, writing or printing; a proclamation or promulgation, such as the publication of the gospel. It consists of the act of offering a book or booklet to the public either for a money consideration, contribution or gratuitous distribution. Let it be kept in mind that Jehovah’s witnesses are his publication agents, that the gospel is published by reason of his commandments, and that the men and women go from house to house exhibiting the gospel of the Kingdom in printed form and thus publish it or make it known to others as God has commanded them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the immediate jurisdiction of the Brooklyn office are the United States and other countries, and islands of the sea, to the number of twenty-one in all. In these various places Jehovah’s witnesses, as publishing agents, have gone from house to house exhibiting the literature to the people and placing the same in the hands of those who desire them. Within this immediate jurisdiction testimonies have been given to the number of 25,537,791; there have been placed in the hands of the people within this jurisdiction during the year books and booklets to the number of 11,325,908. This is an increase in the publication or distribution of books over the year 1933 of 1,453,573.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above-mentioned work of publication has been done in the face of tremendous opposition. This opposition has come chiefly from the religionists. Clergymen have incited police officers and magistrates, and others, to wage a bitter warfare of persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses. The reason for such opposition and persecution should be made clear, and the only way to make it clear is to call attention to God’s Word; which is here done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Light and darkness are diametrically opposed to each other. Concerning Jehovah God it is written: &quot;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” Jehovah God is the fountain of light and life. Concerning him it is written: &quot;Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Jehovah my God thou art exceeding great, majesty and state hast thou put on: wrapping thyself in light as a mantle, stretching out the heavens as a tentcurtain.”—Psalm 104:1,2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth. Pss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God sent his beloved Son to earth to bear witness to the truth, and concerning him it is written: &quot;In him was life; and the life was the light of men. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”—John 1:4,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus declared: “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8:12) Jesus came to bear witness to the truth, and every one who is of the truth must do likewise. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, are bearers of the light of the gospel of God’s kingdom. Concerning them it is written: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.” (1 Thess. 5: 5) Again, concerning those who are the followers of Jesus it is written: “For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.”—Eph. 5:8,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan the Devil is the prince of darkness, because all his deeds are wicked. For long he has been the god or ruler of this wicked world, which he has ruled in darkness and wickedness. (Eph. 6:12; 2 Cor. 4:3,4) Satan is the great adversary of Jehovah God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. He hates the light and loves darkness, and all of his agents follow in his lead. All opposition to the light is engendered by Satan and is carried on by him and his active agents. Satan, the god of this world, employs fraud and deception and by this means blinds the minds of the people that do not believe the truth, and this he does lest the light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ should shine unto them. (2 Cor. 4:4) It is written: “All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light/’ (Eph. 5:13) The truth of God’s Word, therefore, makes manifest or publishes the fact of the wickedness of Satan and bis agents and reproves such, and hence calls forth the wicked opposition of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has taken out of the world Christ Jesus and his faithful followers as his witnesses. Christ Jesus is the great witness, the Faithful and True Witness, and his followers are and must be witnesses to Jehovah, (Acts 15:14-16) These witnesses must show forth the praises of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, who have called them out of the darkness of Satan’s organization and given them the light of truth. (1 Pet. 2: 9,10) Concerning the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ the apostle says for himself and all who are of like mind: “For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. ’ ’—2 Cor. 4:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These scriptures show that the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who are of Jehovah’s witnesses, must be publishers of the truth. To them has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, which testimony they must deliver by going from house to house and telling the people about the Kingdom, and this they must do regardless of all opposition. Necessarily they are the objects of Satan’s wrath, and he seeks their destruction. One of the names of Satan the Devil is “Dragon&quot;, and concerning him and Jehovah’s witnesses it is written: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12:17) The woman mentioned in this last text is God’s organization. The remnant mentioned therein are Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, a few of whom are now on earth; and these are the seed of God’s organization, the children of Jehovah and his woman. (Isa. 54:13) These faithful ones keep the commandments of Jehovah God, and in order to do so they must deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, which has been committed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing scriptures clearly prove that there is a deadly conflict between that which is light and that which is darkness; that Jehovah, Christ Jesus and the faithful followers of Jesus stand for the light of truth; that Satan the Devil is the personification of darkness, and all who practice the works of darkness are the agents of Satan. Upon this point, says the scripture: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Rom. 6:16) It is therefore clear to be seen that those who oppose God and his work are the servants of the Devil. This is true regardless of what they may claim to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The method employed by Satan is that of fraud and deceit. His name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Devil</span><span class="font5"> means “deceiver”; and the one means employed to deceive the people more than any other one thing has been and is that of religion. From the days of Nimrod down to the present time religion has been used to blind the people and to turn them away from God and his light of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest religious system that exists on earth, or ever did exist on earth, is the Roman Catholic hierarchy, controlled by a few men and under which have been brought millions of people of honest desires. Satan has used the Roman Catholic hierarchy to blind millions of people. They have been taught error. The Hierarchy has claimed to represent God and the Bible, and at the same time has kept the people in ignorance of what the Bible contains. There are millions of good, honest people who are under the Catholic organization that would turn to God if the eyes of their understanding were opened to the truth. The obligation is laid upon those of Jehovah’s witnesses to take to such persons the truth in order that they may have a chance to have the eyes of their understanding opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mere fact that men or organizations made up of men claim to represent God and Christ is no evidence whatsoever that they do represent God and Christ. In the days of the apostles men were claiming and attempting to do this very thing. They were the apostles of the Devil, but transformed themselves apparently into ministers of light. Concerning this it is written: “For such are false apostles, deceitful ■workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” (2 Cor. 11:13-15) The religious teachers when Jesus was on earth claimed to be sons of God, and claimed to represent him, and yet they were the active agents of the Devil, keeping the people in darkness and doing violence unto God’s kingdom and his anointed King, Christ Jesus. Concerning this Jesus said to those religionists, as it is written: “Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech! even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. ’ ’—John 8: 41-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Scriptural proof is here set out in order to show that the opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses originates with the Devil and is carried on by the Devil’s representatives, and that the chief part of the active opposition that is visible to men is at the instance of the clergy, and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The very basis of Satan’s organization, which he uses to persecute those doing right, is commerce or traffic; and this is shown by the Scriptures. (Ezek. 28:15-18) The method used is to charge Jehovah’s witnesses with being engaged in a commercial business and to cause their arrest under ordinances which prohibit traffic, such as hawking and peddling. These charges against Jehovah’s witnesses are wholly false, because they are not in anywise engaged in a commercial business. They could not be hired for money to engage in the work in which they are engaged. They are doing the witness work wholly in obedience to God’s commandments, because they love God and love to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year, within the United States alone, 340 of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have been arrested on charges of violating the commercial laws and thrown into prison. The greater number of these arrests have taken place within the state of New Jersey, and it is well known that the one who is backing these ■ persecutions is the Catholic bishop, known as the bishop of Trenton, who gives orders to Roman Catholic policemen to lie in wait for or search out Jehovah’s witnesses, arrest them and throw them into jail. Notwithstanding the fact that the courts of New Jersey have repeatedly held that these witnesses of Jehovah are not violating the ordinances, the arrests and persecution continue. Policemen have remarked that they receive their orders and must carry them out, and their orders come from the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These arrests and persecutions God long ago foretold in the prophecy of the eighty-third Psalm. The Lord foretells a conspiracy formed by Satan and his agents to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, because they are telling the truth. (Ps. 83: 2-5) The foregoing arrests in. the United States, as well as the arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses in other parts of the earth, are overt acts on the part of these conspirators against God and his anointed ones, and the purpose of which is to prevent them from being witnesses to Jehovah and making known the truth to others. It is a conflict of darkness against the light. The fact that opposition continues, however, is no reason what-*ever for Jehovah’s witnesses to cease their efforts. They must go on and bear testimony to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certain municipalities have enacted ordinances which declare that no one shall go from house to house without first receiving a permit so to do, which permit is to be signed by an officer of the police department. It is attempted to apply this law to Jehovah’s witnesses. No doubt if Jehovah’s witnesses should apply for a permit the same would be denied, but to apply for such permit would be an insult to Jehovah God and in disobedience to his law. No witness of Jehovah could apply for a permit without jeopardizing his own eternal welfare, and the reason they do not apply for such permits is set forth as follows, to wit: Jehovah God is supreme, and his law is above every law. He sent Jesus Christ into the world to do as God had commanded him. What Jesus did and what he commands his followers to do they must do. They must obey God and Christ Jesus, and not man, when man’s laws conflict with God’s laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States of America was founded as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">government upon the announced principles of equality, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship of Almighty God. The supreme court of the United States in the case of Church vs. United States, reported in 143, United States Reports, page 457, holds that the United States is a Christian nation. Justice Brewer in that case reviews such matters of the worship of Almighty God or the practice of Christianity, and amongst other things says: “Beyond all these matters no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, State or Nation, because this is a religious nation. This is historically true. From the discovery of the continent to the present hour there is a single voice making this confirmation. . . . These and many other matters that might be noticed add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">Christian nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The supreme court of New Jersey, where many of the foregoing persecutions have been carried on, as early as 1837 in the case of State vs. Robert Lash, 16 N. J. L. 380, held that this is a Christian nation and recognized the Bible as authority. In fact, the courts throughout the United States have uniformly held that the United States is a Christian nation and that the states are a part of that Christian nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By reason of the foregoing decisions of the courts, as well as the Constitutional provision, the United States and all state authorities are precluded and estopped from denying that the Bible containing the commandments of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus is the superior authority and therefore above the authority of any state, nation, municipality or other legal entity. The presumption must therefore be indulged that all of the lawmaking bodies in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5">prira, in enacting laws concerning peddling and hawking, have no purpose or intention of interfering in the practice of true Christianity by those following the footsteps of Jesus. A legislative body or municipality could not enact an ordinance or law diametrically opposed to the Word of Jehovah God and at the same time truly claim to be a Christian nation. If the laws relative to hawkers and peddlers can be enforced against Jehovah’s witnesses, then the claim that the American government is a Christian nation is an absurdity. This point is here made to show that the prosecution of Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching the gospel is therefore against even the laws of the land of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Above all, this persecution is against Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and his kingdom. The apostles took the lead and made the rule which Jehovah’s witnesses must now follow. When they were being sent out by the Lord Jesus himself to preach the gospel they did not go to towns or municipalities and ask for permission so to do. They went in obedience to God’s commandments and the commandments of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ. They were often arrested and brought into courts, charged with a violation of the law for speaking and preaching and publishing the gospel of the Lord’s kingdom. On one.occasion the presiding judge of the court addressing these faithful followers of Jesus Christ said: “Did not we straitly command you, that ye should not teach in this name! and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. ’’—Acts 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On another occasion the apostle, when commanded by the courts not to teach in the name of Christ Jesus, replied: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.’’ (Acts 4:19, 20) It is therefore manifest that these witnesses of Jehovah could not obey the Lord God and the Lord Jesus Christ and at the same time ask for permission to go from house to house to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also clear to be seen that Satan the Devil, through his religious agents, leads this persecution; and it may be expected that the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses will continue until the Lord himself rises up at Armageddon and smites the persecutors as a vindication of his own name. To his faithful followers Jesus said concerning these persecutors: “These things I command you, that ye love one another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. . . . But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.”—John 15; 17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an evidence that the act of Jehovah’s witnesses in going from door to door to publish and publishing the message of God’s kingdom in book and booklet form is not a commercial transaction, we cite the fact that the publication of the message in book and booklet form done by the Society during the fiscal year was done at a far greater expense than the amount of money contributed for the books and booklets. The deficit during the year amounts to $149,955.42. In addition to that, during the year the Society furnished to the pioneers in the field credit to the amount of $15,163.17. Over and above this, many of the pioneers or Jehovah’s witnesses going from place to place do so at their own expense, paying out money which they have earned and saved while engaged in other work prior to entering the pioneer service. The alleged violation of the commercial laws, such as of peddling and hawking, is seized upon as a pretext and subterfuge to cause the arrest and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, because no other ground can be found to so arrest them. Regardless of this persecution, however, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to obey God and Christ Jesus as God’s Chief Officer, and not to obey man. They will do nothing to violate the law of God, nor the law of man that is in harmony with God's law. They will do injury to no man, but will do good to all as opportunity affords. This they have been doing throughout the year in carrying the gospel of the Kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In passing, however, we call attention again to the Scriptures, that the Lord Jesus declared that the ill-treatment administered to his faithful followers he counts as ill-treatment to himself and that in due time the persecutors of his witnesses shall receive a just recompense. These persecutors are likened unto goats who have ill-used his faithful followers, and concerning them the words of Jesus are quoted, as follows: “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hun-gred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ya gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. . . . Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.”—Matt 25:41-43,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another means employed for the publication of the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ is the radio. Men have assumed to regulate the radio as though it were a man-made invention. Radio is God’s means provided for making known the truth, and which should be employed exclusively in the proclamation of the truth. Like all things else, however, the Devil has attempted to use the radio exclusively, and God suffers or permits Satan to remain and carry on his nefarious work until due time for his destruction. (Ex. 9:16) The Lord God permits his faithful witnesses, however, to still have some use of the radio in the proclamation of the truth. In the United States, during the year, 357 radio stations have been employed from time to time to broadcast the Kingdom message. Stations outside of the United States have been used to the number of 60. There have been fourteen chain programs put on in the United States in that time. Today many radio stations are broadcasting the truth by means of electrical transcription, and this in the face of the vicious campaign of opposition carried on by the Catholic hierarchy. During the year, by electrical transcription radio programs have been broadcast to the number of 20,743. This part of the publication of the Kingdom message has entailed the expenditure of a great amount of money, but the Lord has graciously provided this, putting it in the hearts of others to contribute the money for that purpose. Outside of the United States radio stations have been employed to broadcast the truth in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Cuba, Esthonia, France, Mexico, Fara-guay, and Uruguay. The total number of stations on earth broadcasting the truth during the year is, to wit, 417. In addition to this the Society owns and operates radio station WBBR, which broadcasts the truth each time it is on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year the Roman Catholic hierarchy began an organized campaign of malicious falsehood, misrepresentation and opposition to the Kingdom message being broadcast in America. That institution by the employment of threats and boycott methods attempted to force the radio stations to cancel contracts and to refuse to further broadcast the Watch Tower programs. They succeeded in getting some contracts canceled, and through their publications repeatedly stated that within a short time the Watch Tower programs would be off the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROTEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in 1934 a petition was circulated throughout the United States, protesting against this unholy and unrighteous persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in opposition to the radio programs. That petition was signed by approximately two and one-half million radio listeners, and was presented to Congress at Washington, D.C., on the 24th of January, 1934. Congressman McFadden, supported by others, introduced a bill in Congress to prevent such discrimination, boycott and other threatening methods to prevent the broadcasting of programs. The Society submitted a volume of evidence in support of the petition. The net result was that Congress enacted a law placing all communication under one commission, and that commission is now carrying on a hearing in Washington, which hearing is to be reported to the Congress next session relative to the enactment of further laws as to broadcasting of programs of all kinds. In the meantime Jehovah’s witnesses continue to furnish the programs to the stations which broadcast them for hire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHAIN PROGRAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lectures by the president of the Society ■were broadcast by a network of radio stations in the United States during the year as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Seeing the opposition arising to broadcasting the truth by radio, the Lord put it into the mind of his people to prepare other means for publishing the truth. This means employed has been by the mechanical device of electrical transcription machines and phonographs operated during the year. In the United States 1,757 transcription machines and phonographs have been employed to broadcast the message. At such meetings there has been a total attendance of 1,901,821, at which meetings books and booklets were placed to the number of 64,918. Eight transcription machines have been employed in the following places, to wit: Bahamas, Canal Zone, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Cuba.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year the Society has undertaken to manufacture portable phonographs and to prepare records that require 4| minutes to reproduce the speech, and each one of these records contains a brief and succinct speech concerning some part of God’s Word of truth relating to Jehovah and his kingdom. Up to the end of the fiscal year there had been manufactured and distributed phonographs to the number of 1,245, and phonograph records containing the message of the Kingdom to the number of 17,894. A large number of orders are on hand both for phonographs and for records. This bids fair to be one of the better means of publishing the truth that shall have the blessing of the Lord and bring great comfort to the people. These records can be run on any ordinary phonograph, and it will be a great privilege for Jehovah’s witnesses, Jonadabs and any others who wish to have a part in this work to place these machines and phonograph records in the hands of the people. The machines and the records are furnished to the public at cost, thus enabling the people to have an opportu-* nity of hearing the message in their homes with the least possible cost to them. In these times of great depression many are unable to have radios and the transcription machines are too expensive for them to have; many are too poor even to own an ordinary portable phonograph; but it is the privilege of the pioneers and company workers to take these phonographs to the homes of those who are unable, and permit them to hear the message of truth. The phonographs have in many instances opened the way to introduce the message of God’s kingdom, and this publication has brought much comfort and blessing to those who have heard. During the ensuing year this matter should be pressed, and all of those devoted to the Lord should put forth their endeavors to get these phonograph records containing a brief message of the Kingdom into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has also equipped some trucks with transcription machines and amplifiers. It is expected that more of these will be put in the field, which, by means of a mast reaching sixty feet or more in the air, and at the top of which is a large public-address horn, the message can be heard for a mile or more. By this means a lecture can be put on in a small town of a thousand or more and be heard by the inhabitants of the entire town. All praise is due to Jehovah God and his anointed King, who provides the ways and means for the publication of his kingdom. Truly God’s people are going forward now advertising the King and his kingdom, and, regardless of all opposition, are having much joy in doing this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long ago God declared that he would take out of the world a people for bis name and near the time of Armageddon these would constitute the remnant of his people, whom he would send forth as publishers of the message of his kingdom. These publishers may well be designated under the following divisions: pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters, company workers, and regional service directors. Pioneers are those who, putting aside their worldly vocations, find it opportune to spend practically all their time in the field publishing the message of the Kingdom. To be a pioneer one is required to devote a minimum of 110 hours per month to the actual work of bearing testimony to the people. These are in no wise book agents, nor booksellers, but are preachers of the gospel, who carry the message to the people in printed form and afford them an opportunity to hear of God and his King and kingdom and to take their stand on the proper side. Auxiliaries are those who find it impossible to devote as much time to the field service as that required of pioneers. To be an auxiliary one must devote 50 hours per month to calling upon the people and exhibiting to them the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Company publishers are those who are associated with the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses and who devote their spare time, especially on Sundays, to going from house to house and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. They find it necessary, of course, to earn their support for themselves and families, and when their work is done in this behalf, instead of wasting time they employ it by bearing testimony to Jehovah’s King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sharpshooters are those who, employed in some other matter of necessity to earn their food, take advantage of their opportunities given to them of giving testimony to the truth. None of the foregoing publishers are in any wise book agents or booksellers. They are not engaged in any commercial business. Money is not the inducement for them to engage in the work, but they publish the message of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom because God has commanded all of his anointed ones thus to do and they love God and delight to obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note that in 1924 the total number of pioneers in the field was 437; auxiliaries, 364; whereas ten years later, to wit, in 1934, these publishers in the field numbered, to wit, pioneers, 1,976; auxiliaries, 946; making a total of 2,922. Added to these publishers are those in the various companies scattered throughout the territory. The monthly average of company publishers and sharpshooters in the United States exceeds that of 1933 by 3,300. During the year they have increased their hours of service more than a half million hours over those of any previous year. The literature placed in the hands of the people by the companies and sharpshooters during the year shows an increase of 725,000 over the previous year. In addition to the books and booklets, they have distributed 774,706 copies of special editions of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enrollment of all these publishers, namely, pioneers, auxiliaries, company publishers, and sharpshooters, is kept by the service department at the 117 Adams Street office. Regular reports are made by the field workers, and the work of publishing the Kingdom message is done under the direct supervision of the service department. Embraced within the company of publishers aforementioned there is a goodly number of those called “Jonadabs”. By a “Jonadab” is meant one who has taken his stand on the side of the Lord and who is serving the Lord by giving testimony as opportunity affords. In many instances these Jonadabs are even more zealous than others who have been in the company organization for years past. These see their privilege of serving God, and it is such a joy to them that they cease not to serve God day and night as opportunity comes to them. Surely the Lord must love these who have recently come to a knowledge of the truth and who show so much zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The combined efforts of the publishers aforesaid during the year 1934 has resulted in putting in the hands of the people in the United States the total number of 11,325,908 books and booklets, as hereinbefore stated. In addition to this literature they have visited the people and talked to them, obtained their signatures to petitions and brought them words of comfort and encouragement in this time of great distress and oppression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TESTIMONY CARDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These publishers of the message of the Kingdom learn to be more efficient as the days go by. It is not many words that is required, but a clear and succinct statement of the purpose of this publishing work that is beneficial to the people. A card bearing a brief testimony has been prepared and placed in the hands of the workers, and these cards have been used with splendid result. From every part of the field come the reports that the card method is the most effective way of giving the testimony. The publisher approaches a person and hands him a card and requests him to read it. Silently reading a card a person is much more likely to be interested. His attention is undivided, and when he sees that the purpose of this work is to bring to his attention information that is of so much importance at the present time, if he is one of good will he is likely to ask for literature and make a contribution to help others to understand the wonderful message of the Kingdom. When it is taken into consideration that during the year testimonies to the number of 25,303,055 have been given it can be well Appreciated that Jehovah's witnesses in the United States have been diligent and that many have heard about the Kingdom. It can be more keenly appreciated than ever before that these are in truth and in fact publicity agents of the Lord. Woe be unto those who oppose God's publicity agents! These men and women Who act as his publishers are his servants. They are Rot trying to do injury to anyone. They are not even attempting to reap any profit from anyone. They are bearers of the fruits of God’s kingdom, holding forth the light, that those in darkness may see the light and advance to a point that will be helpful to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVISIONAL CAMPAIGNS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year there were five divisional campaigns carried forth in the territory embraced in the United States. Engaged in this work were 79 divisions; automobiles employed, 3,057; witnesses engaged in the work, 13,436; hours employed, 179,202; testimonies given, 1,096,986, books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during these campaigns, 321,824. Transcription meetings during the campaigns to the number of 152 were held, with an attendance of 9,218. This shows a healthful increase in this department of the publishing work during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these divisional campaigns a number of companies assemble within a given territory and by united action make an effort to cover that territory within a certain time. This united action not only is a strong witness to the name of Jehovah God, but results in calling to attention of many more people that God’s kingdom is the hope of the human race and nothing else provides that hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INTERNATIONAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year two of the campaigns were made international, to wit, September 30-October 8, 1933, Kingdom Proclamation Period ; and March 24-April 1,1934, Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the first-mentioned campaign, within 79 different countries on earth Jehovah’s witnesses were active, unitedly working together. On the second of these campaigns, March 24-April 1, within 83 countries Jehovah’s witnesses were actively and unitedly engaged in the service. In these two international campaigns 18 days were occupied in the field. The following table shows the extent of the activity within those periods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This period of united action is exceedingly encouraging to Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere. They fully realize the fact that the Lord is at the head of his earthly organization and that all on earth-are working under his supervision, and not according to human instruction. In carrying out the work in this way they are obeying organization instructions, which instructions proceed from the Lord himself. Believing this to be true, then they take the instructions from headquarters as being in harmony with the Lord and all work together with one great objective, and that is to give testimony to the people that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and that his kingdom will vindicate Jehovah’s name and open the way for life and happiness for the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there have been in the field, traveling from place to place, eleven English brethren as regional directors, their work being to meet together with the companies and to give them instruction to aid them to more efficiently carry forward the publication of the message of the Kingdom. The regional service directors are assigned to specific territory throughout the year, the purpose being to enable each company to have at least one visit from a regional service director during the year. In addition to the foregoing there is one brother in the regional service work who devotes himself exclusively to visiting the colored brethren and serving them and aiding them in the organization and in carrying forward the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the foregoing English-speaking brethren the following field service directors are engaged in a similar work: Greek, two service directors; Polish, one; Ukrainian, one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These regional service directors during the year have traveled in the aggregate 209,415 miles. In addition to the foregoing, men are sent out from the Bethel home regularly to companies within a certain radius of Brooklyn to serve them, especially during the united campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each company nominates one to three persons to ba the service director for that company during the year. From these three nominated the Society selects and appoints one to that position. It is the duty of the local service director to organize the company’s work and carry it on according to instructions received from the main office in Brooklyn. His authority is limited to this work. He is not the boss of the company, by any means, and he should never deal arrogantly or harshly with any of the company. It is not his prerogative to compel anyone to engage in the service, but by a consistent course of action himself, and by taking the lead, to encourage others to enter the service, showing them that it is man’s greatest privilege now to serve Jehovah God and publish the message of his kingdom. Sometimes these service directors get the wrong ideas of their duties, and difficulties arise in the company. If the spirit of the Lord prevails and efforts are put forth to do the work according to the Lord’s will, and selfishness entirely avoided, the service director would not be blameworthy. It often occurs also that some in the company desire to have things done in their own way, and this shows that such are not moved by an unselfish spirit of devotion to the Lord. Both the service director and each member of the company should appreciate the fact that they must be united in a common cause on the Lord’s side and against the enemy, and that whenever there is difficulty arising between members of the company, such is an evidence that somebody is not m</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">anif</span><span class="font5">esting the right spirit. The church is at unity now, and everyone who is of the Lord will work together harmoniously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another means of publishing the message of God’s kingdom and making known the King Eternal and his anointed King is by united efforts put forth at conventions. During the year a number of regional conventions were held, attended by the local and regional service directors and members of the companies, and these unitedly have been a great aid to one another and rendered a splendid testimony of publication to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding convention in the United States during the year was the one held at Los Angeles, in March, 1934. That convention was attended by between 4,500 and 5,000 brethren, coming from different parts of the country. It was the Memorial season, and those participating in the Memorial appreciated as never before their great privilege. They saw that nine of the plagues upon Egypt had been antitypically fulfilled and now the preparation is in progress for the fulfilment of the tenth plague upon the world, and that in the meantime it is the duty and privilege of all the anointed, not only to participate in the symbols of the Memorial, but to continue to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah God as his witnesses, serving notice upon those who desire to find a place of refuge in God’s organization. That convention at California was a great benefit to the Lord’s people. A public address was delivered at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday afternoon, on the subject “World Control”, to a visible audience in one hall of approximately 7,000, with two other halls connected by wires, making a total audience that came of about 15,000 persons. In eddi-tion thereto that public address was broadcast from coast to coast over a network of 151 radio stations. This included short-wave stations; and their programs were distinctly heard in the remote parts of the earth, South Africa, England, South America and Australia. Immediately following the broadcast another lecture was delivered, particularly for the benefit of God’s consecrated people, the subject being “Requirements”, and this was broadcast over a network of 55 radio stations, including short-wave stations for foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another convention, particularly directed from the American headquarters, was one held in Toronto, Canada, on July 6-8. This convention was attended by approximately 5,000 persons and was a season of great refreshing and blessing to those who did attend, and a tremendous witness for the public. More details will appear in the Canadian report. Early in September a convention was held in London, England, attended by approximately 4,500 of the consecrated, and a public meeting with lecture on the subject “Flee Now”. The attendance was approximately 15,000. More details concerning this convention appear in the British report. September 7-9 a convention was held at Basel, Switzerland, attended by 2,500 of the consecrated from different parts of Europe. See the Central European office report for more concerning this convention. At all the foregoing conventions the president of the Society was present and addressed the brethren and the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society sends forth a number of men who are specially authorized to represent the Society both at private and at public gatherings of those who study the Word of God. The divine ordination and commission for these is set forth in the Scriptures at Isaiah 61 ■. 1,2. The Lord Jesus applies the prophecy or commission to himself and to all those who are fully devoted to him and who engage in the service of the Lord in making proclamation of the message of the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTSIDE TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Territories where the gospel was published outside of the United States but under the direct supervision pf the United States are as follows: Alaska, Bahama Islands, Bermuda, Bolivia, British Honduras, Canal Zone, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Dutch Guiana, Ecuador, Falkland Islands, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts, B.W.I., and Spanish Honduras. The publishers of the gospel in these vicinities report direct to the Brooklyn office, and the distribution of literature is included in the total number set forth under the United States as hereinbefore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> began in the autumn season of 1919. Since then it has had a healthy steady increase of subscriptions and covers a wide area, reaching many persons in different parts of the earth. It publishes the matter that needs to go to the people but which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> cannot publish because devoted to other parts of the work. The purpose of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> is not to make money; it carries no paid advertisements whatsoever, and receives no revenue. The small subscription price taken by it is turned over to the Watch Tower funds, all of which go to the publication of the Kingdom message; consequently there ia no pecuniary profit to anyone in connection with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the English issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font5">that magazine is published also in Bohemian, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Netherlandish, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish. There are many readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> who pronounce it the best magazine that comes to their desk, because it is frank, open and free from extraneous influence, striking always at the truth in an honest endeavor to make known what the people desire to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCHTOWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The official organ of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> It is published every two weeks. It is announced with confidence that the Lord uses the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to transmit to his consecrated people things that he reveals to them and provides for them to know. It is the privilege of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to publish explanation of the prophecies, which explanation is based upon the physical facts that exactly fit the prophecy and show that the explanation is correct. There is no attempt on the part of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to interpret prophecy, for the reason that no human creature can interpret prophecy. Prophecy is of divine origin, and it can be understood only when in course of fulfilment or after having been fulfilled. Long centuries ago God caused holy men to write the prophecies, and now it pleases him to unfold them that his faithful witnesses on earth at the present time may be assured that they are in the right way, and that their hope may be strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of Jehovah’s witnesses read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">and many others, including the Jonadabs, who obtain much consolation and help therefrom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> carries no advertisements whatsoever, as that word is used commercially. It advertises Jehovah God, his King and kingdom, and this to the honor and glory of Jehovah. It takes a small amount as a subscription price, all of which goes into the general fund for the promulgation or publication of the truth. At the Brooklyn headquarters </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is published in the following languages: English, Armenian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">is published in other languages in different countries, as shown in the report herein, including 'F</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">innish</span><span class="font5">, Swedish, and Dano-Norwegian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Brooklyn office maintains a correspondence department, and here Bible questions are answered by mail for the aid and comfort of those who desire a more personal explanation. In addition to this, of course, there is a large correspondence in connection with the various matters of the Society’s work. During the year letters and cards were received at this office to the number of 301,817, and like mail was dispatched from this office to the number of 377,579. The above figures do not include the correspondence of the president’s office, which alone is quite voluminous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIELD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The field activity of Jehovah’s witnesses embraces the entire earth. National lines are not fixed by the Lord, but are fixed by organizations of this world. These national lines are recognized in the distribution of the work of advertising the Kingdom because of the different languages and the laws and customs governing the nations which must be observed. Aside from the main office at Brooklyn, the management of which is under the direct supervision of the president, there are 49 branch offices. It is necessary for the president to keep in close communication with all of the managers of these various offices. Each branch office reports regularly to the president’s office, giving a comprehensive report of all the work carried on under the jurisdiction of such office. All these reports must be carefully examined and cheeked and instruction given from the president’s office accordingly. This involves a voluminous correspondence and much work, which is done with real joy. At the conclusion of the fiscal year each branch office reports to the president’s office, and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> cannot be prepared until all these reports are in. A summary of the reports of these various branch offices is set out in the following pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA (East and South)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Cape Town, South Africa, the Society maintains a branch office, from which the operations of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom are carried on, both in South and in East Africa. Those engaged in the work are chiefly English-speaking people, but there are others, among them Dutch, Portuguese, Germans, and natives, who carry forth the work. The giving of the testimony in far-away Africa during the fiscal year of 1934 has materially increased, and this is gratifying, and praise is given to the Lord therefor. During the year the message of the Kingdom has been distributed in South and East Africa in the following languages; English, Afrikaans, Chinyanja, Xosa, Sesuto, Zulu, Portuguese, Hollandish, German, Greek, French, Gu-jerati, Yiddish, Urdu, Tamil, Hindi, Chinese, Italian, and Arabic. With the addition of Sesuto and Zulu to the list of languages during the year, it is now possible for practically all the people in South and East Africa, whether they be European or native or oriental, to be informed about and to have an opportunity to respond to the Lord’s goodness in providing his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Africa is a country great in area and comparatively small in population, but it has pleased the Lord in these last days to carry the message of his kingdom into that country. The work during the year has progressed regardless of opposition by the Catholic hierarchy and others of the clergy. Satan has been unable, by the use of all his instrumentalities, both visible and invisible, to stop the shining of the light in that land. During the year 1934 there have been placed in the hands of the people in that country bound volumes to the number of 45,467, and booklets to the number of 214,687; or a total of 260,154. This is an increase over the previous year of 63,601 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be gratifying to Jehovah’s witnesses in other parts of the earth, where conditions are better, to read the following excerpts taken from the report of the Society’s local manager of Cape Town:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been a healthy increase in this part of the work. The average number of workers in action each week in the Union has gone up from 110 to 136, and there has been a corresponding increase in hours, testimonies and obtainers. The quota of testimonies for the year was 275,000. Actually 340,993 were given. The printed testimonies have done a good work. All workers now understand clearly just what constitutes &lt;&nbsp;“testimony”, and the presentation of the card ensures that the purpose of the visit is made known before there as opportunity to shut the door. The fact that we are not “booksellers” is now better understood by the public, and many people of good will gladly embrace the opportunity to contribute to the Society’s printing fund to assist with the cost of manufacture and distribution of the bterature. There are only some half-a-dozen big towns in this country, and many of the people live in small dorps and on farms. With the help of auto-cars and motor-cars the pioneers and other witnesses are penetrating into every cornel, and the message of the Kingdom is being brought to the attention of all. The pioneers and auxiliaries have again set an excellent example and zealously pressed the battle to the gate. The former are very grateful for the provision made to help them meet their expenses in the work. A brief resume of the house-to-house witness work in the Umon is given herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaign Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ou account of the fact that a considerable number of witnesses live in comparative isolation with a consequent lack of ‘ ‘ territory ’ ’ around them, it is not possible for such to engage each week in the service, but the special campaign periods furnish an opportunity to all to have a share at regular intervals throughout the year. It is gratifying to report that there has been an excellent response on such occasions, and the figures for each eSort reflect an increase over the results for the corresponding periods of the previous year. In the March campaign we had a 100-percent turn-out of witnesses, and with a number of Jonadabs cooperating the number in action was considerably in excess of that of the Memorial participants. The figures for the five campaigns follow:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcrlptlon Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">▲ year ago the work with the machines was just beginning and the opening shots were being fired. The number of machines has grown from six to eighteen. These are scattered throughout the country, and in proportion to the effort put forth by those who have them the Lord is blessing this part</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of the work with results. During the 'year 862 meetings have been held, and 1,281 complete lectures given. The total attendance was 31,548, giving an average of 36 persons per meeting, and the number of books and booklets placed at such meetings was 5,075. The pioneers have done much of their work in the “market place'' and “in front of the post office'' or other convenient spots. Little advertising has been necessary. The playing of a musical record calling attention to banners on a car announcing the meetings has been sufficient to draw the crowd. In the towns more effort is required, but by putting on well advertised lectures at regular intervals the companies have bad some good meetings and the follow-up lectures have resulted in a number of studies' being formed in different districts of Cape Town and other towns. Arrangements are in hand for a number of the talks to be recorded in Afrikaans, and this will considerably increase the effectiveness of the witness in the country districts. The message is getting around to such an extent nowadays that persons who have heard the talks in one town will sometimes introduce themselves at another meeting in a place perhaps a thousand miles away with the remarks, “I heard one of your machines in action at ------. This is surely a splendid method of advertising the message you have for the people. ’' To advertise the meetings in the towns and elsewhere upward of 200,000 leaflets were distributed, while posters, window cards and news ads also helped the good work along. We now look forward to handling the new phonograph and 4J-minute talks, for this will still further increase the Kingdom witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we arranged service assemblies at Durban, Cape Town, and Genmston. Transcription machines were used to good advantage, not only to convey the Kingdom message to the public, but as a vehicle to carry the Lord’s message and your own personal words of comfort and encouragement to the anointed, in such talks as “His Organization'' and “Bequire-ments''. The assembled brethren were greatly enthused as our obligations and privileges as members of Zion were so pointedly brought to our attention, and it was with joy we went forth to give the witness from house to house. Special efforts were made at the divisional campaign week-ends, even though on account of the great distances brethren had to work mainly in their own groups or even in isolation. We were conscious, however, that we were sharing in the world-wide effort being made at such times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eecape to the Kingdom, Dividing the People, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Recovery,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> containing the message in such dear and concise form, were widely distributed. We have had many inquiries at the office for the Society’s free booklet in which all the publications are described. Many books have been placed as a direct result of the interest aroused by these booklets. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has had a greater distribution in the eight months we have handled it than any other bound volume yet published by the Society in a similar period of time. Quite a number of the publications have been translated into Afrikaans and also into the principal languages of Bantu origin, such as Xosa, fiesuto, Zulu, and Chinyanja. During the year 35,000 books and booklets in the various Bantu vernaculars were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the course of the year the Society established a depot at Zomba, and a European brother was sent from the Union in April to organize the work in that part of Central Africa. This has resulted in a considerable impetus being given to the work m that land, and it gives pleasure to report that the brethren have been greatly encouraged and are working together harmoniously. During the year there has been a weekly average of 38 company workers. They have spent 19,936 hours in field service, given 123,175 testimomes, and placed 4,592 pieces of literature. In addition to the above, two pioneers from the Union, after completing the work in Portuguese East Africa, Eive the testimony in November to the small European popu-tion at Zomba, Blantyre, Limbe, etc., and placed 700 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rhodeslas</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Unlike Nyasaland, in which country responsible government officials have been just and given us opportunity to organize and control the work of witness, the governments of Northern and Southern Rhodesia persist in their attitude of refusing to permit European witnesses from the Union to enter these parts of South Central Africa to organize the work effectively. Brethren resident in these countries have suffered much persecution. Although the law of Rhodesia guarantees religious liberty to all sections of the population, our native brethren are continually harassed by the C.I.D. and their literature is frequently confiscated. A number of them have been imprisoned and otherwise abused and ill-treated. Much of this persecution is instigated by the missionaries, who are thus putting on their ‘garments’ and clearly indicating whom they serve. In spite of the opposition and persecution, Jehovah’s witnesses in these countries go bravely on. The Lord has richly blessed them in the work of testimony, and, when brought before the rulers and magistrates, they are able by the Lord’s grace to give a good reason for the hope that is within them. In making their defense they quote freely from the Scriptures and submit relevant passages from the publications, such as pages 31-33 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Cnete.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> If any set of rulers more than another will not be able to say &quot;We didna ken&quot;, then surely it will be the rulers in that part of the British Empire. While it is impossible to get complete and accurate reports from all centers, such records as we have received indicate that there has been a weekly average of 37 workers. These have spent 15,099 hours in the witness work and given 67,752 testimonies. There have been 9,865 obtainers of literature, who have received 11,759 pieces. The Kingdom message of hope and deliverance has brought joy and gladness to many in those lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">East Africa and the Isles of the Sea</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The work previously accomplished in East Africa and the islands of the sea continues to bear fruit. Recently we received a letter from a gentleman managing a gold mine in Tanganyika. Although he lives 120 miles from the nearest post office, two or three booklets have found their way into his possession. After reading them he immediately got into touch with the Cape Town office by air mail, requesting a catalogue of all Judge Rutherford’s books and, apparently realizing that he had discovered another kind of gold mine that was worth exploring, he requested that we reply by air mail In due course we received his order for a complete set of books and booklets. There is now a little company on the island of St. Helena, and one of the new phonographs will shortly be brought into action there. On the island of Mauritius there is also a little company who have taken a definite stand on the side of Jehovah and who are doing what they can to further the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;The Golden Age&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been a gratifying increase on both files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">More work in the field means increased work at the office. It is a great privilege accompanied by unspeakable joy to be kept busy in the Lord’s service. Our day’s work begins at S: 00 a.m. and frequently ends at 10: 00 p.m. Close to 6,000 letters were received, and a similar number dispatched. In addition, 6,000 circular letters and 4,000 Bulletins were sent out. Our little hand-feed Flatten machine turned out 218,350 window cards, office stationery, etc. Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning, pubhc holidays and additional days in the campaign periods are devoted to field service. At other times, on Sundays and on certain evenings during the week, when not in the office, we are busy at transcription and study meetings. There are not many hours in the week that we can call our &quot;own’’ and when we do get an hour at the close of the day there is always the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to occupy our time, and they give us renewed strength and courage for the next day. In common with our brethren at headquarters tre realize that there is a war on and accordingly there is no time for &quot;visiting”. We regard it as a responsibility unto the Lord to conserve our strength for the work. Although conscious of our limitations, we are doing our utmost to faithfully carry out instructions from headquarters and to encourage our brethren in this land to do likewise. The house-to-house witness report covering the activities of the three brethren in the office during the past year is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Workers Hours Testimonies Obtainers Books Booklets Total</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The total distribution is in excess of last year’s figure by 1,000 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In closing this report it gives real pleasure to report that the brethren in this land are working together in unity. The clearer light on the new covenant has brought great joy and an increased appreciation of the responsibility resting upon those who have been selected as &quot;a people for his name”. As the great battle draws near, our one desire is to remain faithful and maintain our integrity that we may have the great privilege of being associated with our beloved </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA (West)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">West Africa is a very large area of territory. The Society’s office at Nigeria exercises supervision over Nigeria and the Gold Coast. While this country is under the control of the British Empire the greater amount of witness work is amongst the natives. There has been a healthy increase of the work during the year over and above that which was done previously. This has been greatly aided by the use of the transcription machines, six of which machines are in operation in that country now. The opposition to the truth has increased in West Africa. Necessarily, this is to be expected, because the Devil uses his instruments everywhere to oppose the message of God’s kingdom. Regardless of all this opposition the work goes forward to the praise of Jehovah and his King. From the local representative’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The ranks of the unemployed are increasing daily, and the world's outlook is discouraging to them; because of that many are giving heed to our publications, that the only hope for the world is in the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan the Devil tried to disorganise the faithful workers in Nigeria, and succeeded in a measure with a few of them, by using one, TJkoli by name, to interfere with the Lord’s work. Some of the Jonadabs took sides with him, but after awhile, because of his egotistical manner, many sincere ones withdrew from him, after learning that organization instructions are not discretionary, but mandatory. We thank you for your letter of August 6, and what we quoted from it to the workers of lawlessness made a clean separation, and also stirred up the ire of the lawless ones, as you will see in the newspaper clipping sent. In all of it the work continues to grow. Many are calling for water immersion, and entering into the service work, in fulfilment of Bevelation 22: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The transcription machines are doing valuable service among the English-speaking people. How glad we were for the six machines sent in April this year. They increased the placing of the literature, especially that of booklets. The transcription lectures assist some in dividing of the people. The records “Flee Now” and “World Control” are doing some work, along with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eighteous Euler.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> You will be glad to know, dear brother, that the faithful workers on the west coast of Africa, especially in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, and Nigeria, nave exceeded last year’s output by 29,509 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year 79 public lectures were held in English and Yoruba, with a total attendance of 10,520. Transcription lectures, 152, with a total attendance of 3,450. Company meetings, 310, with an attendance of 3,450. Letters received, 402; dispatched, 412. Number of books sent out, 17,525, and booklets, 76,839; a total of 94,364 books and booklets. In addition, over 50,000 handbills were distributed for advertising public lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the priest-ridden country of Argentina, where there is much opposition from that source, the witness work concerning Jehovah’s kingdom continues to increase. Of course, the opposition cannot prevent its increase, but the opposition is mentioned here merely to show that Jehovah’s witnesses there as well as in other parts of the earth must battle against difficulties. The territory of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay is under the jurisdiction of the Society’s office at Buenos Aires. The number of workers is small, but their zeal is in keeping with the house of the Lord. The distribution of books and booklets in this territory during the fiscal year is as follows:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of booklets and books distributed by the workers under the jurisdiction of the Buenos Aires office during the year was 93,009. In addition to this there were placed in the hands of the people 329 Bibles, 7,785 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font5"> for which contributions were received, and 33,303 distributed free; and, in addition thereto, 70,795 tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other means of proclaiming the truth in that country has been by radio. During the year 174 programs have been broadcast by means of electrical transcription. This has increased the interest of the people, and more people are rejoicing in the truth than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Paraguay the work has only recently begun, and there is a small number working. The manager of Argentina reports that people in Paraguay are very humble and easily approached. Even those in higher ranks are not proud and haughty as they are in other places. It seems that this field is opening for a wider witness for the truth. In Paraguay the Hierarchy, as Satan’s instrument, carries on the persecution against the little company of workers there. Two pioneers were arrested and taken into court. They were searched and their literature was taken away from them. Upon the hearing of the case they were given their freedom and told to go ahead and keep on preaching. Following their same tactics as in other parts of the earth, these agents of Satan cause some of the pioneers to be arrested as hawkers and peddlers. The chief of police, hearing the testimony of these pioneers, took out of his own pocket five pesos and handed it over to those claiming taxes, and sent the pioneers away and told them to go ahead and preach the gospel, that they should not be interfered with again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the pioneers working there, are two sisters who recently went from Mexico, and also some Polish, Italian, German, and Spanish and native witnesses, who are working together. Amidst difficulties and with much joy the brethren in that part of the field continue to press forward in publishing the message of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch office at Strathfield, Australia, has immediate jurisdiction over the vast area of Australia, New Zealand, the South Sea islands, including Java, and Sumatra. It must be borne in mind that great difficulties are encountered in bearing witness in some parts of this territory, particularly in heated zones of the East India islands. Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the earth are not great in number, but they are strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Their zeal for the Kingdom has been made manifest during the year. Of course, there have been some hangers-on who have not been satisfied with things done according to organization orders. There are always some selfish ones who get in the way, but the real ones who are devoted to the Lord and his cause have not been retarded in their efforts because of such hangers-on. The results during the year are exceedingly gratifying, and the report of the local manager is submitted herewith, from which the following excerpts are taken, and quoted with much pleasure:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the beginning of the year 1933-34, when the Australasian Branch quota of one million pieces of literature and two and a half million testimonies was set, we scarcely dared hope that this objective could be reached. The report shows that Jehovah baa abundantly blessed the efforts of his witnesses m this ter-ntory, and to him is due all the praise. Thanks be to his holy name for the privilege of sharing in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Although there has been no open attack upon the work in this land, yet there </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> abundant evidence that the clergy and their allies are becoming very angry and are opposing the work in every possible way in an endeavor to prevent the people from hearing the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution of Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The various tables showing the distribution of literature during the year are attached hereto. Bound books to the total of 142,477 were placed; an increase of 9,956 over the previous year. Nearly one-third of the bound books placed consisted of the book Preparation, or a total of 42,954. During “Dividing the People” Testimony Period, in January 1934, 11,820 of these books were placed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e days. The total literature placed during 1933-34 was 1,005,868 pieces, there being an increase of 36 6 percent over the previous year’s total. A comparison of the work done during the past four years reveals the fact that the number of pieces of literature placed during 1933-34 is nearly three times the number placed during the year 1930-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The five special testimony periods held during the year were occasions of rejoicing and enthusiastic service, and the results were surely blessed of the Lord. The figures disclose that nearly one-third of the year’s total placements were made during these five special periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Although there has been a decrease in the actual number of pioneers reporting during the year, this branch of the service is now better organized and we have every reason to believe that the ranks of the pioneers will increase in the months that are ahead. There has been much to hinder in the shape of abnormal weather conditions, yet in the face of these difficulties faithful witnesses cover the vast distances of this remote and far-flung territory. During the year, one party almost completely encircled Australia, traveling over 7,000 miles in witnessing to the peoples of the sparsely populated northwestern and northern areas. The trip occupied five months, 1,246 testimonies were given, and 3,544 pieces of literature were placed. Of the total literature placed by this branch during the year, the pioneers accounted for 56.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the auxiliary service there has been an increase in the number of workers. The auxiliaries placed 10.7 percent of the year’s total amount of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The increase in the numbers of the company workers and sharpshooters is gratifying. To their ranks must be added the increasing numbers of Jonadabs now engaged in telling forth the Kingdom message. Company workers and sharpshooters placed 32.7 percent of the year’s total</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In connection with the regional service directors’ visits to the various companies, long distances have been traveled, the total mileage covered during the year being 54,331. Four brethren have been periodically engaged m this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As in the United States of America, so in Australia, the Boman Catholic hierarchy has been working overtime to end the broadcasting of the Kingdom message. In spite of the Devil’s subtle activities through his earthly representatives, the clergy, there are still twenty-five stations in five out of the six states of the Commonwealth broadcasting the Kingdom message each week. The minister in charge of radio in Australia tries to justify the objections of the clergy on plea that the lectures are controversial To this a high official in a radio corporation, who is friendly to the truth, replied that if his organization refused to broadcast all matter that is controversial, nothing would be broadcast at all. Every item at present on the radio programs is objected to by someone. Recently, George Bernard Shaw, upon being refused the New Zealand radio facilities on the score that his speeches were controversial, humorously remarked that scrutiny of the radio program revealed that the only non-controversial items were the time signals and weather reports. Radio broadcasting of the truth has ceased in Java for the time being, owing to the opposition of the Catholic hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The special broadcasts comprising the series which include the lectures ' * Intolerance ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ World Recovery ’ ’ were broadcast by twenty stations. Twenty-three stations participated in the broadcast of the lecture “World Control”. It is expected that the lecture “Flee Now” will be broadcast during the Kingdom Praise Period. As a countermove against the Devil’s efforts to stop the broadcasting of the Kingdom message in Australia, Jehovah’s witnesses are now busily engaged in obtaining signatures to a petition to the Federal Parliament. This petition is along s</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imila</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">r lines to the one circulated in America last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Electrical Transcription</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Results from this branch of the work are gratifying, particularly the outdoor work. Due to the difficulty in obtaining some of the necessary parts in Australia, the number of machines in operation has not increased as rapidly as expected. It is not practicable to import the machines, owing to the high duty which must be paid. These duties more than double the original cost of the machines. We are glad to state that the machines we have in use have been built by consecrated breth-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sen. Much . iperimenting has been necessary, and Bome </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the parts supphc ' by local manufacturers have been found to be unsuitable an ' have had to be replaced. Otherwise, the machines which have been constructed by our brethren are giving very good results, and, now that the initial difficulties have been overcome, we expect many more machines to be brought into use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The result of the year’s transcription work is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Island Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The work in the Islands is earned on under great difficulties. The European population is small and usually proud and haughty. The huge native populations are mostly illiterate and very poor. However, a good witness has been given, and we hope for a substantial increase during the coming year, when it is expected that two boats will be brought into use. This will make possible the giving of the witness in hitherto inaccessible islands. During the cyclone season, which lasts about six months of the year, many of the islands are entirely isolated. Even when steamers are ru</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g it sometimes takes a week to reach an island only iifty miles distant from the starting point. This is due to the circuitous route taken by the steamer in visiting other islands. It ordinary transport lines are used m working these islands, it might mean a stay of six or seven weeks in one place which contains territory sufficient only for two or three days. By the use of boats it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> hoped that these difficulties will be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Various attempts have been made to gain an entrance into the French colonies of Tahiti and Indo-China for the purpose, of giving the witness there, but up to the present our efforts have not been successful. This we know is due to the influence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Further attempts will be made, which we hope will enable us to carry the Kingdom message to the French colonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviewing the year’s work, while all the praise is due to Jehovah for the results achieved, we desire to express our appreciation of the manner in which the campaigns have been directed from head office. We are grateful for the steady flow of new publications which has been provided by the Lord. On each occasion when a new booklet has been announced for a special tew</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tunnn</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">y period, we have always received our supplies in time to plaee the booklets in the hands of the workers for the campaign. This is surely a wonderful example of the manner in which the Lord’s organization is functioning, from the head downwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions and also the subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> have increased in that land. The local branch has issued </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins </span><span class="font5">to the number of 15,400, received letters to the number of 12,288, dispatched letters to the number of 6,859, free circulars to the number of 28,695. The messages by electrical transcription, broadcasting the lectures of the president of the Society, have numbered 1,449; the broadcasts of the Kingdom message, to the number of 1,175. Radio stations broadcasting the truth during the year in this section number 30. There has been a wide publication of the truth. The small number of persons engaged in the work have given testimonies to the number of 2,542,111. The publication of the truth in Australia has been far greater during the fiscal year just ending than at any previous time. Thus it is seen that as depression in commercial matters increases, the opportunity for giving testimony to the truth and comforting the people increases. All praise is due to the Lord. To him thanks is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishing the truth in Austria continues under great adversity. 'Wherever Satan’s black agency operates, darkness reigns and gross darkness covers the people. The light that breaks through into the minds of some eheers them and gives them greater opportunity to prove their integrity to Jehovah God. Some may often wonder why God permits the Catholic hierarchy to fraudulently use his name and mislead the people and blind them to the truth. The answer is found in Exodus 9:16 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5">; “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” Now a few have the chance to maintain their integrity while giving the testimony, and God's power will be exercised in the complete destruction of all workers of iniquity. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah in Austria delight to continue their efforts to publish the truth. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 266,854; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages </span><span class="font5">to the number of 99,896; Bibles, 802; which somewhat exceeds the work done in the previous year. Considering the many obstacles in the way and the difficulties encountered, there is every reason to greatly rejoice for this continued publication of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">No district service meetings took place, because of the rather strained political conditions. The authorities even forbade in different cases the Watch Tower studies, even though these meetings were held in private homes. They claimed that the pubhc tranquillity and security was in danger, though there was not one single proof that we had ever disturbed anybody. Another time it was claimed that the Catholic inhabitants found fault with such meetings. Of course, we entered protest against this, but, though some of the cases are about half a year back, nothing has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The authorities confiscated also two booklets; one of these two because of the notice of a pnest, as later came to light in court 12,000 booklets were taken by the police from the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Often the brethren are stopped in their work from house to house, but they do not let themselves be discouraged. Many brethren were sentenced, but they paid no fines; they went to prison, where they had opportunities to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One brother had a little chapel in the front of his house, as often seen in Tyrol. After he heard about the Truth he put the statue of Mary and the cross away, had the chapel whitewashed, and gave a painter the order to paint Scripture texts in the walls of the chapel. After half a year some policemen came, took the broken statue of Mary and the cross, which had been lying under a bench along, and told the brother that he would be arrested on the charge of religious disturbance. A few days later he and his son were arrested by several &quot;Heimwehr” people (a political organization which the government uses) at 5 o’clock in the morning. He was declared guilty of high treason, but because the district attorney withdrew his accusation he was released after twenty days’ arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Another friend sent us a letter from a mayor in Tyrol, telling him that, though he was a good worker, he would be discharged because he had left the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Even though the Constitution stands for liberty of faith and conscience, and the chancellor emphasized this fact in different speeches, we have great difficulties when we act according to our faith; which is further proof of Gog's conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of all these difficulties the brethren continue their work with joy. Also a few Jonadabs have joined up with us. We work with the witness cards, by which the work is more simplified and unified. The brethren do not preach so much any more. We dare not go out with the large bags, because the different official agents get suspicious at once. We have many opportunities of making use of the scripture: &quot;Be wise as serpents!' ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerning the future we pray to Jehovah that he may keep the door of opportunity open, that we may be active as long as possible to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These few items are further evidence of the duplicity and crafty conduct of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, posing before the world as the representatives of God and of Christ but continuing their efforts to keep the people in total ignorance of the truth. The Lord will duly recompense them in his own good way and time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The country of Belgium contains many good people who are held in subjection and are prisoners within the meaning of the Scriptures. The Roman hierarchy dark bird watches with lustful eyes over the Belgians and attempts there, as elsewhere in Europe, to interfere with the people’s hearing the message of God’s kingdom. Acting at the instance of the Hierarchy, those who are non-citizens of Belgium and who are engaging in the pioneer service have been expelled, thus reducing the number of servants in that country. In spite of all this, the remaining ones during the year have distributed books and booklets to the number of 128,632. Only 105 persons in Belgium partook of the Memorial, and, out of these, 90 are company workers, and 70 out of the 90 have participated in the service. During the year the company workers have done more than in times past. In the town of Brussels every one of the company has participated in the field service. The local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As there are but few brethren, the dear pioneers have done most of the work. The majority of these pioneers are foreigners. Learning this and seeing their diligence, the authorities refused to grant the pioneers permission to stay in the country. That is the reason why the number of pioneers has decreased to such an extent, and therefore not so many pieces of literature were distributed as last year. During the past year there were at times 26 pioneers in the service, and this year, in the first half, there were 11, and now there are just 6 left; two of these are Belgians. Four auxiliaries, also Belgians, have now joined them in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the books and booklets placed in the hands of the people, copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> have been placed to the number of 25,803. Bibles have been placed in the hands of those who had none previously to the number of 301. Continuing, the following is from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Thanksgiving Witness Period was our best. The special witness periods are always a cause for extraordinary efforts, but during this period, a letter from Brother Rutherford inviting everybody to participate, more than ever was done. With the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> we have had pleasant and also laughable experiences. There are many people in Belgium who can neither read nor write. After one farmer had read the witness card with much difficulty, telling about the he-goats and sheep, he said: “ Go to my neighbor, he has a he-goat. ’ ’ Another said: “My sheep aren’t sick’’; and still another said: “Nothing doing, we haven’t got any sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Poverty is always increasing. It is to be seen that many people fear that a war might break out, or a revolution, or some other catastrophe. Jesus' words are being fulfilled: “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our main concern is that the authorities do not allow the foreign brethren to distribute the literature. Under the threat of expulsion from the country they have to sign a paper that they accept the order not to distribute these books. Yet the brethren haie confidence in the Lord and say that they will obey Jehovah more than men. The authorities have examined the books and declared that they will not allow foreigners to distribute such literature. We are told that Belgians should do this, but we are sure that they would also forbid Belgians if the law would not forbid such a course of action. Hereby they have identified themselves. We wrote to King Leopold III that he should have this matter investigated, that we may be treated justly. We sent him the books in French, for which he thanked us, but was sorry to say that he could not do anything for us. We applied to the premier, but received no answer. Just lately we appealed to the minister of justice, who has control over the foreigners, but again the answer was negative. We pray that Jehovah may soon give his enemies their just punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Belgian fnends joined in the protest of Toronto, London, and Basel against the persecutions of Christians in Germany. Numbers of copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> containing the report of these persecutions were distributed amongst the people. Two brethren occupied in this work were attacked by twelve young men, who seized their bags with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies and insulted the brethren. This attack was so rough and nasty that even the police investigated the matter and tried to find the evildoers, so as to bring them before court. A Catholic paper congratulated the plucky fellows, and, because Jehovah’s witnesses came so often into the village, the paper wrote a nasty article full of lies about the work and also about Judge Rutherford, but the press-law forced them to retract this article in their own publication. While they gritted their teeth, we rejoiced that the paper itself must give its readers a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Belgium is a Catholic country. There are very few Protestants. But the Protestant preachers are also our enemies, as can be seen from the following: They dictate to their people what they are to read and what not. The Watch Tower publications are, of course, among the latter. These men are blind shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we were able to give a radio lecture every Wednesday. The station can be heard only within a radius of 50 miles. Once the proprietor received complaints that he poisoned the people’s minds through the Watch Tower lectures. He answered through the microphone: ‘' It is better to be poisoned by the truth of the Watch Tower than by the poison gas in the next war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Hopefully we look towards the future. We expect that soon three transcription machines will be m use in this country. We pray to the Lord daily that he may guide us in the work of honoring his name. The Belgian friends are also very thankful for the spiritual food which they receive through </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> These truths, which are studied regularly in the meetings, give to all much joy and courage to carry on the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name under all conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The use of the word “blind” here means those who have no natural eyesight. Amongst such there are some who are anxious to know more about the Lord’s kingdom. The Society prints in the Braille language for the blind certain literature. During the year there have been 78 of these who have begun reading that which is furnished. In the Chicago library we have in service 104 volumes prepared for the blind. Almost all of these are in the hands of readers. They are read and then returned to the library. During the past year the Branch for the Blind has loaned 482 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to 26 readers, 21 of whom are still reading. There has been furnished to branches outside of the United States, for the benefit of the blind, literature to Australia, South Africa, British, and Canadian branches. The pioneers and company workers everywhere should take notice of the fact that the Society maintains a branch at Logansport, Indiana, for the blind. The address is 1210 Spear Street, and the pioneers and other workers coming in contact with blind persons who desire to know the message of the truth should communicate with the office at the above address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries the Catholic hierarchy has had a free hand in Brazil and has succeeded well in causing the people to be in ignorance of God’s kingdom. The Lord’s due time has come, however, to have the gospel of his kingdom preached for a witness in that land as well as in other parts of the earth, and during the year this has been done. While the witnesses are few in number, yet the method of preaching the gospel, by word of mouth and by the printed message, has been carried on. Also, the Kingdom message was broadcast by radio. The publication of the gospel of the Kingdom was carried on in Brazil during the year to the extent of placing in the hands of the people 2,342 books and 19,078 booklets, or a total of 21,420. More literature is being prepared and printed for the publication of the gospel in that land, and the work continues, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office at London, England, has immediate jurisdiction over England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and the Channel islands. That territory has long been religion-ridden, that is to say, dominated by the clergy, Catholic and Protestant, who have influenced politics and commerce and made common cause with the same. Jehovah has found his witnesses in that territory, however, and for several years there has been an earnest, zealous, active publishing of the truth. Those who have been called out of darkness into the marvelous light and have been anointed as Jehovah’s witnesses have come from the various divisions of the Catholic and Protestant religious organizations, and many outside of all such. When one is given the garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness by Jehovah he is no longer affiliated with any earthly organization, but is marked and identified as a child of God and a servant of the King and Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Britain this year has made splendid progress. In the face of increased unemployment and greater depression advertisement of God's kingdom has increased within this territory and the publication of the message has likewise increased. During the year bound books and paper-covered booklets containing the message to the honor of Jehovah’s name and for his kingdom have been placed in the hands of the people to the total number of 2,931,794. This is an increase of more than 300,000 over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems proper to here mention in connection with this increased witness work that the testimony card has been used to splendid advantage. Time has been saved, much talking saved, and more people interested, who have availed themselves of the opportunity of getting the Kingdom message in form that they can study in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A personal visit of the president to London during the year, and coming in contact with thousands of the brethren in different parts of the country, affords the proof that the brethren within this territory are in better spiritual condition than they have ever been heretofore. They have a keener appreciation of their privilege of serving Jehovah, and united in his holy cause they go forward with zeal peculiar to his house. The local manager has made a comprehensive report. The following quotation is taken therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a great joy to us to send you an account of the year's work in the British field and by it to report an inciease in the result of the labor of love done by the faithful in the service of Jehovah and for the honor of his name. It has been a year of happy service to all; and unquestionably the willing service done for Jehovah has brought his rich blessings upon the brethren. As is to be expected, those who in this «ray Beek the glory of Jehovah and the fulfilling of his will are realizing a closer unity of faith and service than ever before. The brethren in this part of the field are seeing themselves more clearly than ever as separated unto him their God; and in this they are realizing their oneness with their brethren through all the earth. The gathering opposition of Satan’s forces as reported in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> undoubtedly has helped to that realization; but the bond of the love of God under the leadership of the glorious Lord is the unifying power. The Lord's visible house in Brooklyn, the center of his work upon earth, is that which effectively draws us all to him and to his work. It is this realization of unity and purpose which has been the effective cause of the good report which we here send, showing the work accomplished in doing the will of Jehovah, for the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In figures, the branch report of the year's work is an output of 2,931,794 books and booklets, and in placing these the number of testimonies given to the honor of Jehovah and concerning his King and kingdom is 7,392,456. These figures are an increase on those of last year by 261,909 volumes and 497,712 testimonies. The average number of brethren regularly out on service monthly has increased from 4,217 to 4,318.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In this part of the gieat field, which in the hand of the Lord </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> under your supervision, we are for the most part in the favorable position of having little manifestation of opposition from those who yet have power in this evil orgamzation. The exception is in the Irish Free State, and m such parts of Ireland as are under the control of the B C. priests. There our brethren have been put to loss, and some bodily hurt, and the literature which would help the people has been destroyed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fot</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> this freedom in other parts of the country we are thankful, and the brethren are being urged on by what has happened in the United States, and Germany, and otlier parts, to do all they can while the going is good. Hence it is confidently expected that the new fiscal year upon which we now enter will see a further increase in the hours worked, in testimonies given, and in literature placed. There are signs also that the Jonadab class are going to take an active share in the work and so place and prove themselves. Undoubtedly there are very many persons in this country who will declare for Jehovah before the end comes, and evidently these will come forth from their prison only after hearing afresh the truth which gives liberty to the captives. Detailed accounts of the figures stated above are attached, and are summarized as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Owing to the limited area in Britain and under the present conditions territory cannot be found for more than about 210 active pioneers and 110 auxiliaries As that number were engaged last year and fully active, it follows that there is not much difference to report in the number of hours worked; but, owing to the fact that more work has been done with booklets, and the use of the testimony card, there is a very considerable increase in the witness given. Last year the pioneers gave 1,580,207 testimonies while placing 514,863 volumes; this year they have given 1,749,660 testimonies and have placed 704,474 volumes. The auxiliaries have not done quite so well, for whereas last year their number of testimonies was 592,645 with 137,357 pieces of literature left, this year their figures are, testimonies 571,861, though they have increased their placements to 187,358. There is a slight falling off in the hours of work both by the auxiliaries and by the pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are 371 units in the British field, and already 173 of these have 227 transcription machines in use. During the year m this service there have been held 13,169 meetings, with a reported attendance of 400,547, and 38,949 pieces of literature have been placed at the meetings. Of the new phonographs there are 24 already m use with the brethren, and there are 3,550 discs in the companies. This new phase of the witness is proving a great stimulus to the brethren, for one person by machine can give a testimony to many in the same time as to one person given in the old way, and with the certainty that the word heard is an exact expression of the truth to be declared. The brethren are seeing the unquestionable advantage of the record both in increased power and the certainty of the message, and we confidently expect to be able to report a great increase of the testimony to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and a general advantage to the witness of the Kingdom while the time for service lasts. The shipment of 900 records which was received at the time of the convention was disposed of m three days, and 1,000 more were ordered. Also 200 phonograph machines are on order. The two motor house-cars we have in service have placed 14,210 pieces of literature, and they report having noted 16,227 listeners. Their mileage on the service is noted as 6,493 miles. The third house-car which you instructed us to start will soon be ready and will be used in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The aerial mast which you sent us from C</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">anada</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and instructed us to put into use is expected soon to be m operation, and we confidently expect to report good results from this exceedingly effective manner of witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the 371 service units under the direction of the London office there are 346 which have reported monthly of the work done. The holders of certificates on our records number 5,175, and of these 4,007 have regularly taken part in the service. This number of active workers is an increase on the last report of 10 percent, though the hours worked are rather less, at 474,979, to compare with 486,608. Quicker work has been done, however. The testimony card is undoubtedly the cause of this; 5,070,935 testimonies have been given, to compare with 4,793,892 last year. The total of placements of the service work is shown as 1,509,566, to compare with 966,163 last year. The special testimony periods are entered into with zeal, and that persistent intention to do the work which the Lord has shown to be the will of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the special booklets received, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler, World Recovery, Intolerance, Dividing the People,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> there were placed 1,738,869. The last bound book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has been well received: 66,305 volumes have been sent out. In the work the average of testimonies per obtainer has been reduced from 4.9 to 3.3, which again shows the effectiveness of the testimony card both as a time-saver and as a direct help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Twenty-five service assemblies have been held during the year, attended by 8,882 brethren in the work, and at these 213,909 testimonies were given. These meetings have been a stimulus to the brethren and have undoubtedly done their part in giving the encouragement the Lord purposed when he directed the brethren to meet together. There was no unusual feature at these meetings, except at one held at Wednesbury. There the local council had been influenced by the clergy to cancel an arrangement which gave our brethren liberty to use a park for a transcription service. This opposition gave us an opportunity of telling the people of Wednesbury something about these self-appointed ‘ ‘ spiritual leaders ’ ’. They got to know something about themselves which they had not realized, and others also learned this. Following your direction a petition which was placed before the people of the town resulted in 4,323 persons’ signing the petition, saying, amongst other things, they did not want these clergy to do their thinking for them. This number of signatures was obtained by the local brethren within a period of seven days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The London convention, when you were with us, has been the outstanding feature of the year’s work. It was a great time of encouragement and of united service; undoubtedly every one of the Lord’s people here was stimulated for further and better service. The thrilling talk on Daniel’s experience, and the great public meeting on the Sunday night, will never be forgotten. In some respects, perhaps in all, that public meeting can be said to be the best we have had in London. The message “Flee Now’’ came as a personal message to those who were present m their thousands, and it was that also to others who were not actually present at the meeting, for we had reports of your voice’s being heard distinctly even two miles away. The loud-speakers were very effective both in the large auditorium and evidently in carrying your voice so far afield. The convention was an event never to be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bethel family continues to enjoy its special privileges of service: the office staff, the packing and printing departments, and the home force are all doing their best to have the Bethel machine do its work as a satisfactory part of the whole. The office has received during the year 50,902 pieces of mail and has dispatched 55,770 pieces. These figures are considerably in excess of last year’s and represent a corresponding increase in outside activity. The packing department has sent out 27,011 packages, large and small. Our two printing machines and printers record 3,786,706 items off the press. The privilege of serving together is enjoyed by all and we are all glad to serve as directed. The family enjoys its privilege of field service, and the transcription machine we have has added much zest to the work, besides that it quite evidently makes it at once easier and more productive. The family has a piece of music and a record of one of your short speeches each day as we eat our midday meal. At the morning meal we have, as always, consideration of the morning text, and at evening always some portion from the current </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Monday evening weekly study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> gives </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ub</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> one of the happiest and one of the most profitable hours of the week. All the members of the family are, of course, certificate holders, and all take a part in the work. The record of hours in the service during the year is 4,056, with testimonies 39,616, at the rate of 9.8 per hour, with placements of 4.1 per hour and 2.9 testimonies per obtainer. The output of the family service is 17,182, an increase of 3,148 on last year’s figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The new enlarged general office, which is being made according to the instruction you gave, is now almost ready, and certainly it will make for better service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> list keeps about the usual level: the number of renewals is slightly less, but the number of new yearly subscribers is increased. The food the Lord supplies by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is strong for those who are weak, who require only milk, or are unable to make use of the meat Jehovah is providing for his mature people. But it is noticeable that those who now come into the way of the Lord find it exactly suited to them, and even the Jonadabs get their nch portion by its means Surely it may be said that the constant flow of hvmg water of truth through </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is one of the Lord’s special signs that he is with his people, guiding them into his way and leading them into his will. By every evidence </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> stands alone; and the brethren realize that it is exactly fitted to them, and they know that it is Jehovah’s messenger to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> circulation here is exactly at the same level &amp;s last year. We could wish that its circulation were increased among the brethren. Probably they have not noticed that of late it has been carrying much more from your pen than was the case. This shall be emphasized, and we shall be glad to report progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The general condition of the country’s affairs is slightly more favorable than at this time last year: trade figures have increased a little, but there are no signs of any upward movement nor evidence of better times to come. However, the fact that things are not so bad as they were is something to take note of and also to take advantage of, and that is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your recent visit to London and the joyful gathering of the British brethren to meet you m convention would show you that your visits are looked for with much expectation. Wlule you are away their prayers ascend to Jehovah that his blessings may be upon you for his name’s sake.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH GUIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in British Guiana has not made much progress during the year. The publication of the message has been as follows: Booklets, 6,673; books, 1,266. This work has been done by 22 company workers. There is only one organized company in British Guiana. From the local manager’s report the following quotation is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of heavy rains in December last, followed by the unusual floods of January (involving much loss of livestock and farm produce in the rural districts), and the increase in depression which was a natural consequence, we have been able to keep the message of the Kingdom steadily before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Twenty-two public meetings were held, the total attendance being 3,430, and we hope to develop this feature in the future, particularly with the transcription machine and the new 12-inch records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Although there is a slight decrease in the total number of our company workers, there was a corresponding increase in the weekly average in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Class attendants, though small in number, are regular, and the company in general is m good condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been exceedingly difficult to get the message of the Kingdom published in Bulgaria. By the brother recently sent there to work the following report is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Till now not much could be done in this country in spreading the message of the Kingdom. But in this fiscal year, with the approval of the president, for the first time efforts were made to spread there the message amongst the people. Some pioneers were sent to Sofia, the capital of the country, and they worked there some time with good success. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ab</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> soon the enemy see that, he tried everything to hinder the preaching of the gospel The country is very strong under the influence of the Greek-Catholic clergy, and the ecclesiastical council resolved to take action against Jehovah’s witnesses, and the hypocritical indictment was taken up, Jehovah’s witnesses had any connection with communism. The clergy had the success that the brethren must leave the land. The government’s officers themselves showed good will and proved that they only by the influence of the clergy have driven out the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The report for this year reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimonies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,089</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark33"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours worked</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark34"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklets distributed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark35"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Books distributed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark36"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Obtainers</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The low number of books is explained by the fact that we have no books in Bulgarian language, but that are distributed only a few foreign books, especially Armenian. There are also some interested friends, but they have no proper understanding of the service. Notwithstanding we hope to the Lord that he has also in this country some witnesses who will give the witness before the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office at Toronto, Canada, gives attention to the publication of the Kingdom message throughout all the provinces of that land, also Newfoundland. Compared to the vast area of territory the population is small, which necessitates the traveling long distances by the witnesses in order to reach the people and deliver the message. During the year Jehovah’s witnesses have shown their zeal and faithfulness in meeting all manner of obstacles and progressing with the publication work. In the service performed these faithful witnesses of the Lord have employed books, booklets, magazines, radio, transcription machines and phonographs, and this necessitated the use of automobiles, motorcycles, bicycles and boats, and many traveling afoot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This division of Jehovah’s army working in the field during the year averaged 1,960 persons per month, which is a decided increase over the number engaging in the work in the previous year. The largest number working in any one month was 2,573. These put in in the field an aggregate of 483,323 hours, giving testimony to 2,688,073 persons, and placed the Kingdom message in 763,430 homes; and the total number of books and booklets placed during the year has been, to wit, 1,537,572. It is observed, therefore, in comparing this with last year’s report that there has been a healthy and decided increase in the work and the results of the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses publishing the truth throughout this area of the field have shown their faithfulness and devotion to God’s kingdom both by their zeal and by the results of their efforts. This is especially made manifest in the five testimony periods. The zealous ones throughout the provinces responded to each one of these periods, as many as 2,573 persons engaging at times in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will strengthen the faith of God’s people in all parts of the earth reading this report to know that the opposition in Canada and Newfoundland has been sharp and ever on the increase during the year and that this opposition has come from the clergy, and that the faithful have progressed in the face of this opposition. This is conclusive evidence that Satan uses religion as his chief means of opposing God; thus Satan demonstrates not only himself to be a liar and a hypocrite but that his agents are likewise hypocritical liars. The Catholic hierarchy is strong in the eastern part of Canada and, fearful of losing its hold upon the oppressed people, from which it derives its revenue, its cardinals, bishops and other subordinates, including the Jesuits, continue to oppress anyone who carries to the people the message of good cheer. Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with individuals, of course, and their only purpose in going into Canada or anywhere else is to bear the message of God’s life-giving and life-sustaining truth to the people as Jehovah has commanded them to do. The “goats” continue to manifest their viciousness, and their end is near at hand and is definitely stated by the Scriptures. It is impossible in the brief space allotted to this report to give all the details of the persecution in Canada and elsewhere, and hence we must be content to look at a few of them, which are merely samples of the wickedness practiced by Satan’s crowd upon God’s faithful witnesses in the earth. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The year opened up with The Kingdom Proclamation Period, during which the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Way of Escape</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet was distributed, and this campaign met with marked success, as the figures hereinafter given reveal. Within this period, and as authorized by you, there was the added blessing of an intensified drive on the city of Quebec, the Catholic stronghold of this continent. For many years now, as you are aware, there has been a persistent and intense bombardment of the province of Quebec by Jehovah’s witnesses, resulting m case upon case being fought in the courts and many of his servants’ being cast into jail. As a testimony of the hatred of the Catholic hierarchy toward Jehovah’s witnesses it might be well to summarize briefly the outstanding features of the Quebec city onslaught mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Quebec is a city of some 130,000 population and is practically solidly Catholic, 95 percent of the people being Frenchspeaking. The nearest place thereto at which Jehovah’s witnesses reside is Montreal, 175 miles away, and there there are but few. In order, then, to gather together a troop large enough to attack the city brethren had to be assembled from the Toronto district, 600 miles distant. In due time a convention was arranged for at Montreal, and there the volunteers for this particular campaign assembled. They were given explicit and full instructions as to the method of carrying on the work, and on the closing day of the convention 40 cars, bearing 158 workers and fully armed with ammunition for the attack, left for the city of Quebec. Each car had its particular territory assignment, and each worker his individual assignment. The booklets to be distributed were printed in French and consisted of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom, Heaven and Purgatory,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religious Intolerance • Why.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> These were wrapped in packets of three, the wrapper bearing the message suggested by you, namely: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Read</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Now I </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">This Important Message fob</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Yon </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">from</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Royal Priests (1 Peter 2:9).&quot; Sharp at 6:30 o’clock the next morning every worker went into action, and within an hour and a half 45,000 booklets were spread throughout the city. Just a few days prior thereto we learned that the archbishop of Quebec had called a plenary meeting of the Canadian episcopacy to take place in the &quot;dear&quot; city of Quebec on the day following our attack. Such an important conference is held only once m five years, and great preparation is made for it, and special masses held. As a consequence there were priests there from all parts of the eastern States and from all provinces of Canada, as well as thousands of laymen, and when our workers commenced the onslaught the streets were filled with the &quot;faithful&quot; on their way to early morning mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Within half an hour after the pubhcation work began messengers rushed to the priests and the pohee were hurrying over the city to make arrests. Out of the 158 workers of Jehovah’s witnesses the police succeeded in rounding up and imprisoning 30. Jehovah’s witnesses calmly went about their work and did it faithfully and were not frightened by the appearance of officers. So great was the excitement in the town of Quebec that it well appeared that a foreign foe was trying to sack the city. The fact is that God’s message of truth frightens the Catholic hierarchy much more than an invading army of guns, tanks and air bombers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It was not until some hours after the friends were taken into the police headquarters that an official charge was laid against them. After much deliberation it was finally trumped up and they were charged with &quot;... being a party of a seditious conspiracy&quot;, and a date was set for the preliminary hearing. When the brethren appeared at that time they had changed their attire as much as possible, the sisters particularly wearing different hats, and as a result the policemen were much confused and could identify only six of the 30 arrested. These were sent up for trial, and it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> expected their case will be heard during the early part of November of this year. All who had a part in this service, and particularly those who are held for trial, are greatly rejoicing in the privilege and blessing which is theirs of suffering in the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Since this campaign the anger of Satan and his hosts has increased and is everywhere manifest through his agents. They have with much bitterness fought Jehovah's witnesses at every opportunity, with the result that we have had no less than 59 brethren involved in cases in that province during the past year, being charged with many crimes, “publishing blasphemous libel,” “having a part in a seditious conspiracy,” “disturbing the peace, ” “ violating the Lord's Day Act. ’ ’ But, despite all this opposition, by Jehovah's grace the greatest witness ever given in that province has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of the earnest workers in the field make reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the past season the priests have repeatedly advocated unlawful measures to interfere with our work, many times engaging carloads of men to follow us, to spy on us, interfere with our witnessing, arouse the people to mob violence, and on other occasions have caused the arrest of those who are keeping the commandments of God. Without a single exception the trouble can be traced to the religious leaders, of whom Jesus said, “Ye are of your father the devil.” We have great difficulty in getting camping accommodations, as the people are afraid to have us, even those who are favorable. One has little idea the hold the priests have upon them and how fearful the people are of the power of the pnests, who will resort to the basest of means to accomplish their purpose. Many times the brethren have been ordered from their camping site after having settled for the night. On one occasion one of the tents was the target for several hundred stones, two of the brethren being in the tent at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Today we stopped for lunch about two miles from a town, when three big cars drove up and there poured forth from them about twenty men, including the mayor and pnest of the town. From all sides came threats of burning. I got out my camera while they were talking French to the men. The priest called for them to take it away from me and the mayor tried to, but I held on. It was really too dull to take a picture, but it made the priest skip to cover and the men felt rather mean. In the territory we are now working the people have been well warned. They know what we have immediately and are of the spirit that is only too glad to join in chasing us out. No one will even give us vegetables in exchange, and we are forced to camp in the woods for protection at night. One man said we were worse than the Devil, that we were polluting the whole country. We were pleased to hear that. One thing is sure: no matter how dark the prospect seems, the Lord always provides a camping place for us and something to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At St. Joseph de Beauce two of our brethren were arrested and charged with “selling without a license”. We had fought other cases at this particular point, and in each instance the judgments given ware moat unjust and. unreasonable. Again on this occasion a good witness was given in the courts and ample evidence presented to show that the accused were innocent, but, as before, the judge ignored all testimony and fined, the brethren $100 and costs or 30 days in jail. In view of our former experiences it was useless to fight the case further; so the brethren chose the jail sentence. It seems very evident that the Devil’s crowd are after the money of Jehovah’s witnesses. If the friends would refrain from paying fines and go to jail the opposers would soon find themselves outwitted. More and more this policy is being adopted by the workers in tlus land. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of pioneers in the field averaged 179 monthly, showing a slight increase over last year, while the largest number engaging in the service during any one month was </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">222.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> These, with characteristic zeal, have carried on the battle with unabating courage and joy. In the summer months their witness has been given in the small towns and rural territory, while during the winter their activities were concentrated in. the larger centers. The three most important of these were the pioneer camps m Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, where the brethren assembled in groups of 28, 66 and 19, respectively. In these cities houses were rented and furnished largely with articles loaned by the company members, and each camp was thoroughly organized. Particularly interesting was the witness given in Toronto and Vancouver. In both of these cities there are a large number of company workers who have always, with abounding zeal, borne testimony to the Kingdom, covering their territory over and over again with splendid results. Despite this intense witness, however, the pioneers swept the cities and obtained excellent results. With the economic administration of the camps, the cooperation of the local friends and the general results obtained in the field, all were able to care for their expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the summer the pioneers have reached into almost every nook and comer of this far-flung land, and particularly interesting have been the reports from the brethren working by car far up in the northern interior of British Columbia, and from those covering the 7,000 miles of the western coast line by means of a motor boat. Some indication of the joyful time they have been having in this outlying territory is given in the following reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the British Columbia boat: &quot;Many logging camps which employ hundreds of men in the summer season are situated on islands and inlets, and our efforts at these points have been confined mainly to placing the literature. It is difficult to hold transcription meetings, due to the fact that the men can be reached only between supper time and bed time and it means many idle hours for us during the day and fast work in the evenings to call on them before bed time. This also applies to the transient fishing camps which move along the coast from place to place following the flow of fish. Hundreds of small fishing boats accompany them. The fishermen are on the fishing grounds all day and can be reached only after their return in the evening Despite this, however, we have had many opportunities of giving the witness by means of the transcription lectures. Many of the logging camps are built on large floats and he nglit on the nver, and so we have found that the most effective way is to broadcast the lectures Tight from our boat. Thus the message goes out clearly over the little settlement and all are able to hear. There are, of course, a large number of isolated settlers also here and there along the coast. In all classes we find numbers who have taken a definite stand for the Kingdom and who want to be fully in hue with its principles. They seem to be in a waiting attitude as to what to do and readily take the literature to obtain that information. The Lord’s protection over us has been marked on many occasions when we have had to buffet the storms and rough weather, and we indeed greatly appreciate the privilege of bearing testimony to his name and kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the pioneers in the northern interior: “This is a territory where civilization has left few tracks and much of the wild west still exists. Cowboys parade about in full regalia of ehaps, spurs, and ten-gallon hats, busting bronchos and roping steers. Large reserves of Indians are located here and there. Because of the scarcity of people we make bold to hold up everybody that comes along the road and invariably leave with them some books. Oftentimes the roads are long and difficult to travel, but m almost every case we find someone waiting for the message. Upon one occasion we stopped to meditate the advisibility of continuing, but decided to go on. Hours later we eame upon a ranch and found everyone away but three cowboys and one Indian. They showed real interest and dubbed together and obtamed six bound bonks and all the booklets. The next morning an Indian nder overtook ns on horseback with the statement, ‘Yon got good books 1 More better I take some more before you go. ’ The Anglican Bunday school van came up, but turned back when they crossed our tracks, as we leave too many flies in their ointment. At F----</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we found the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Indian</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> whose letter appeared in the July 18 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> He was highly elated when we came, and vehemently exclaimed, ' We are brothers I ’ On the whole the Indians listen very attentively and all who can obtain literature. In the absence of money, leather goods are offered, buckskin coats, gloves, moccasins. We have had them sit about our campfire until after midnight listening to an explanation of the truth, a siring questions. Their eyes would glisten with suppressed excitement as we told them of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">gdom We have not found much opposition except in some cases when the dominies told us, This is our job’; to which we agreed, but advised them to get out of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hinking</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ship before it is too late.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like other parts of the field, the publishers in this territory are made up of pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font5"> of these have shown a harmonious unity in going forward in their work during the year. The net result of their efforts is stated above in total amount of literature placed in the hands of the people during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is well known by all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> readers the radio commission of Canada, acting at the instance of the Hierarchy and other religionists, have put forth their strongest efforts to keep the people in ignorance of the truth, but still there are people who hear the truth by radio and other means. From the local manager’s reports a further quotation is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The outstanding features in the witness by radio were the chain broadcasts ‘‘The True God”, &quot;The M</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c. God,” &quot;Why Serve Jehovah,” and “World Control”, particularly the latter, which was broadcast from Los Angeles. These were well received throughout Canada from the American stations. Of special mention, too, was your public lecture ‘ ‘ Flee Now ’ ’ delivered in the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto and in turn relayed to the American stations. According to reports it was well received throughout Ontario and the Maritime Provinces, despite the strenuous effort of the enemy to prevent it. The reception in Toronto through the Buffalo station was exceptionally clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Wlnle, as you are aware, the ban against your lectures by electrical transcription is still in force m Canada, nevertheless they are being delivered by local brethren over the following stations: CFCN, Calgary, Alta.; CKMC, Cobalt, Ont.; CKOC, Hamilton, Ont.; CJCB, Sydney, N.S. With these four stations broadcasting the truth weekly and the large number of American stations that are heard m this land the witness by radio has been little curbed by the arbitrary and unjust action of the Radio Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This new outlet for the proclamation of the Kingdom message has been laid hold upon with much enthusiasm by the friends everywhere, and today there are 126 transcription machines in operation, in addition to a large number of phonographs. The number of meetings that have been held by this means during the year totaled 5,450. At these there was a total attendance of 142,949, an average of 26.2 per meeting. The number of 12-inch lecture records in the hands of the brethren and Jonadabs is 1,112. There has been a ready response to this added feature, and it is very manifest that these records will be used extensively in the witness work from this time forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To the end that the transcription service might be more effective and far-reaching, we have, in harmony with your authorization, manufactured a number of powerful amplifiers and horns, and some aeromasts by which the horns are raised 55 feet 6 inches in the air. A few of these are already in operation, and it is encouraging indeed to hear of the splendid testimony being given. While the interesting experiences are so numerous space would not permit to deal with them all here, I might mention one or two of special interest, namely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“There were assembled in a Baptist conference on the shores of Lake Ontario near Hamilton some 3,000 delegates, with all their ‘higher lights’ present. The brethren had arranged for a transcription witness m that vicinity, about a mile and a quarter away, by means of the aeromast and were quite unaware that the conference was in session. Shortly after the broadcast commenced a number of men came rushing up demanding that the lecture be stopped. When asked why, they replied that they were holding a conference and your voice was coming into their tent with such volume that their own speakers could not be heard. Needless to say their demand was not heeded, and they went away in great anger saying they would call the police. The program of one hour was completed, however, and no further interference was experienced. So the delegates at the conference had the joy of hearing your entire lecture ‘Flee Now’. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the regio</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nal</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> service directors who is using the powerful amplifiers with his electrical transcription machine writes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“I am highly pleased with the Outdoor Public Address System, and the results I am getting are beyond my greatest expectations. It is a wonderful weapon to use against the Devil’s crowd. At Smith’s Falls about 500 heard the lecture. It could be heard plainly six blocks away. The next morning it was the talk of the town and the local friends were much enthused. At Kingston many people had gathered to hear a band concert, which was not to start until 8: 45 p.m. We arrived early and broadcast the lecture to those assembled, about 400. We asked no one’s permission to use the park ana experienced no interference. Last night, at Fordwich the lec-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">90 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ture could be heard distinctly all over the village and even in the church. A large number of people came up to the machine and listened with interest, and the brethren rejoiced greatly to see such an effective means of witnessing in operation. I had similar experiences at Owen Bound, Tara, Bognor, Meaford, and Trenton, where the audiences numbered 520, 120, 104, 160, and 206, respectively.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the past year 184 conventions were held, as a result of which 324,574 testimonies were delivered and 84,625 books and booklets were placed. Outstanding amongst these and in a class by itself was the large convention in Toronto, at which you were present. Some 4,000 friends assembled from throughout Canada and the United States, and Newfoundland, too, was represented. The large public meeting which you addressed in the Maple Leaf Gardens, the biggest and most modern auditorium in this country, having a seating capacity of 16,000, was the greatest public meeting ever held in this land. The place was practically filled when you began your lecture, after which none were admitted to the auditorium and as a consequence thousands were turned away. The echo and reecho of that mighty bombardment is still being heard in this land. Eeyond question Jehovah used the occasion and blessed your effort to the honor and glory of his name and to the comfort and strengthening of hiB people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These conventions have been used of the Lord, not alone as a means of beaiing witness, but also for uniting his people </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">anil</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> strengthening them in the great battle of faith against Satan and his forces, and invariably thereafter the brethren go forth more determined than ever to press the battle to the gate and do with their might what their hands find to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One very interesting feature in this service has been the large number of Jonadabs that are now attending the conventions. This army of those who ‘hear, and say, Come’, is increasing rapidly month by month. During a few small conventions in the prairie provinces over one hundred were immersed, thus symbolizing their consecration to do God’s will. The sincerity of their step is evidenced by their works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All told, the friends in this country are of eleven nationalities and their service is one of spieading the truth amongst the people of 46 different languages. The work of those of foreign nationality has gone steadily on during the year; and while nothing of any outstanding interest has occurred, a substantial witness has been delivered. The number of these brethren taking part in the work averaged 142 monthly. They gave 168,104</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">testimonies, spent 30,764 hours in the field, nnd placed 56,638 books and booklets in the hands of 36,822 obtainera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">General</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">While the rulers in this land are striving desperately to stay the oncoming storm, conditions are going from bad to worse, and the masses, restless under the heavy burdens placed upon them, are manifesting discontent and discouragement in many ways. Though upon the surface things appear to be r</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">unni</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ng smoothly, it is well known that conditions are far from what is desired and that almost anything might break forth at any time. As one goes from place to place and witnesses the distress of the people and the incompetency of Satan’s regime it becomes more manifest that the only hope for the world is God’s kingdom, and for that the remnant sincerely pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As the battle waxes more furious and Satan with his everincreasing anger throws his forces against Jehovah’s witnesses, manifestly they, to stand, must have a full assurance of faith; and the Lord, true to his promise that, “as thy days, so shall thy strength be,’’ has graciously provided for them. He has provided them with an abundance of food convenient, giving them the assurance that they are on the right side and doing that which is pleasing unto him. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> articles have unquestionably been the instruments used by the Lord in this regard during the past year and have made it possible for his faithful ones to have a keener appreciation than ever before of the precious promises set forth in his Word. As a consequence their appreciation and gratitude is reflected in a more intense zeal in telling forth his praises. While realizing the fact that the remnant are certain to suffer persecution and contradiction of sinners in this tune of battle and war, they, with a full assurance of faith in God’s promises, are with boldness and courage pressing the battle to the gate, at all times doing with their might what their hands find to do to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s great name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is true that the pioneer work has suffered a great deal in our territory, because, not only German pioneers, but also English and Swiss pioneers, were expelled from various countries. We had to keep moving them about from one country to another. In spite of this handicap, the work has increased; for the companies and the pioneers who were able to continue have greatly increased the number of hours in the service and thus the balance was made up and surpassed. More pieces of literature were put out than ever before, and this is cause for rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">In General:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the Central European territory there are 450 organized companies, with 6,500 regular members, whereof 5,571 participated in the service during Thanksgiving Week. This number includes 447 Jonadabs, who reported their service. The Memorial report shows, however, 9,370 participating. 206 pioneers worked under this office, but this number decreased to 150 towards the latter part of the year. From 50 to 70 auxiliary pioneers also were engaged in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Company Work:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> When during the year the number of pioneers decreased greatly, we addressed the companies and urged them to spend more hours in the service. In the November </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of 1933 we proposed how it would be possible to increase the quota of hours by 60,000, and the brethren appreciated the admonition. We were glad to see that the quota not only was reached, but was surpassed by 30,000 hours. The increase, therefore, was 90,269 hours. This fact alone declares what a wonderful harmony and determined cooperation exists between the members of the remnant. This remarkable increase of hours spent in the service meant a real effort on the part of the brethren. Surely a remnant will remain faithful to the Lord. It may be remarked here that in the countries of Belgium, France, Alsace, Saar Basin, Switzerland, Austria and Poland a concerted action to distribute </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> increased the subscription list. This action meant 24,296 hours in the service, the distribution of 222,027 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies, and 3,353 new </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The distribution of literature has not increased in the same ratio as the increase of hours might warrant. It was reported that economic conditions in every country are getting worse and that the people are becoming more fearful For this reason the placement of bound books has decreased to the extent of 9,320 volumes. On the other hand, the output of booklets shows an increase of 164,483 copies, and the distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> an increase of 212,152 copies. Thus far in our ter* ntory 7,390 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were obtained during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer Work:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The pioneer service is directed from the Berne office. This branch of service, as stated, was greatly hindered during the year. All German pioneers working in France, Belgium and Austria were sent out of the country, and some were even sent out of Holland. Thus we lost some of our best pioneers. We then hoped to replace them by pioneers from England and Switzerland. The ranks were thus closed again, but soon the Devil caused new attacks upon these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The circular letter issued from the office of the French Ministry of the Interior instructed all police stations throughout France to expel all foreign coworkers of the Tour de Garde. For details see report of France. We believe that this particular attack against the foreign pioneers in France points to the Devil’s conspiracy, in which the &quot;evil servant” plays a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yugoslavia shows an increase of 1,349 books and 46,508 booklets. To compare with 8 pioneers during the last year, there are now 26 pioneers in Yugoslavia. Even though the government does not grant a permanent residence to these pioneers, they come from Hungary when they are expelled there. Some of the pioneers are being chased from one country to another, and yet they continue and often return to the country from which they were expelled, working as long as possible. They endure much hardship, and yet they rejoice and continue faithful, fearing neither men nor devils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The pioneer work in Rumania shows that 14,000 more booklets than last year were distributed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The pioneers in Holland also are having good success. They increased their hours by 11,661. The distribution of literature has decreased a little, for the Hollandish are very conservative and unemployment is also increasing in Holland. However, the work with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> was successful, the pioneers distributing 50,487 copies of the Hollandish </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Summarizing the pioneer service work, we may say that each one has done his best to keep up to the prescribed quota of 110 hours per month. Many work regularly 130, 150 or 180 hours a month, and several very strong brethren average from</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">250 to 350 hours per month. This was the case with pioneers in Yugoslavia and Holland. We are certain that those who manifest their appreciation for the service also experience the Lord’s special care and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jonadabs : </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s word regarding the Jonadab class is being fulfilled Many honest and upright persons axe now manifesting themselves and are participating as Jonadabs in the witness work. Thus, during Thanksgiving Period, 447 Jonadabs reported having had a part in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s Youth:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> A number of young people throughout Central Europe have recently organized themselves. They have also taken their stand on Jehovah’s side, and recently they adopted a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“We, ‘Jehovah’s Youth,’ acknowledge Jehovah as the Giver of every good and perfect gift. We believe in the Bible as His Word of Truth, which He has given for the instruction of man in the way of righteousness. As friends of the truth we wish to support the work of God on earth by participating in the witness work for his name under the leadership of the Society, that is, the witnesses of Jehovah, m order that we might have the protection of Jehovah and of his anointed King, Chnst Jesus, and in God’s due time share in the blessings of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ ‘ Therefore, we would ask the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Judge J. F. Rutherford, to accept our love for God’s people and for God’s truth and to give us, as friends, an opportunity of collaborating in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This Resolution was addressed to the president of the Society, who responded as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Friends,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society debghts to welcome you into the chariot of the Lord, which means to have you travel along with ns as Jehovah’s witnesses and participate in giving the testimony to the honor of his name. The Lord Jesus, Head of God’s holy organization, says: “Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> that heareth say, Come.’’ (Revelation 22: 17) Those of good will and who are called “Jonadabs’’ are the ones who hear and who are to say to others: ‘Come and believe that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King and that the Kingdom is the hope of the human race. ’ I am glad with you and for you that you have taken your stand to be devoted to Him and his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g. You are therefore of those of whom Jesus says: ‘I have other sheep; them also I must bring.’ You are of the Lord’s sheep, meaning that you are obedient to his kingdom. The Society welcomes you as associates in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Continue faithfully to do eo. Study the Lord's Word and thus learn the meaning thereof, and learn obedience. And thus you have the promise that you may be taken through the trouble and share in the everlasting blessings of Jehovah through his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">“King</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be assured of my best wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Signed) J. F. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">President, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Statistics : </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to have a proper comparison we leave out Danzig and Luxembourg, which were added to our territory during the year, and give herewith a general statistic regarding the countries of Austria, Belgium, France (including Alsace-Lorraine), Holland, Italy, Poland, Rumania, Saar Basin, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">company workers 387,259</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total of pioneers 273,919</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">67,637 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;737,056 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174,839</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here we see that the increased hours of the company workers have made up for the decrease of hours by the pioneers and that the actual amount of literature distributed increased above last year, regardless of the retrogression of the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the five special service periods the following result was obtained in the Central European territory:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours Books Booklets</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">202,543 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131,683</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On February 9, 1934, the Society’s president addressed a letter to the German Government demanding that the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses cease, admonishing that if it did not within a certain date, the facts would be published to the world. Facts had been gathered in Germany relative to the unjust treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, the German Government having ignored the request, these facts were published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and distributed in large quantities in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Saar Basin, Alsace, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Poland. Quoting from the report of the Central European office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At regular intervals certain quantities were shipped from different points to addresses in Germany, and most of them were delivered to former readers and Jonadabs in Germany. Several newspapers earned a portion of the protest and parts of this report in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> As was to be expected, in several cities of Germany this issue was confiscated and many homes of the brethren were searched by the police to obtain this issue. However, the brethren are not afraid, and they count not their lives dear unto themselves, but still obtain the forbidden literature in small quantities from different points, and then particularly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> goes out to the brethren secretly. The witness continues in Germany in the face of great opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Often we receive letters from Germany, such as this one:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Here in Germany everything goes well. We are on His side and have joyful confidence. Following the request of our dear friend </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> we hereby report 12 workers, 326 hours, 350 books, 861 booklets, 1,714 testimonies. All those on His side greet you. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time literature has been furnished to the German brethren to the best of the ability of those who could serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was held in Basel, Switzerland, September 7, 8 and 9. This was indeed the best convention yet held on the European continent. The following quotation is from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bight from the beginning, Friday noon, 1,500 brethren were present, and the number of participants increased until on Sunday there were nearly 3,000 friends present. These had come from all directions in Europe to attend the feast. They gathered from Austria, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Poland, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Holland, Belgium, France and Spain and also from America. For some, and particularly for the friends from Germany and Austria, it meant a great sacrifice to come. Some traveled for days on bicycles, some by car, autobus and railway, in order to be at this meeting of God's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On account of the unfavorable political conditions in Germany it was difficult to communicate with the German friends regarding the convention, and yet nearly 1,000 German brethren attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It was inspiring to look at this great gathering of God's people. In all faces one could read the expression of joy and gratitude for all that the great Teachers, Jehovah ana Christ Jesus, had to say to the gathering by their faithful servants. The words spoken were words of comfort and strength for all who are now particularly hard pressed by the enemy. Words of encouragement and words of instruction were given to those who withstand the enemy in the battle and who are privileged to give the testimony to His name and to His honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford's presence at this convention was the fulfilment of a great desire, and his admonitions regarding the position of God’s people in our day as he compared it to that of the three Hebrews and Daniel were very timely. His exhortation that the brethren should now in the coming days keep faithful to the great and mighty God Jehovah found a great response in their hearts. With tears of joy in their eyes they said unitedly: &quot;Yes, by His grace we want to be faithful, come what may.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday forenoon, from 0: 30 a.m. to 1: 00 p.m., a very important conference was held, at which Brother Rutherford presided and where he gave instructions to the general managers, to the local managers and to the regional service directors. Brother Rutherford explained clearly the order of the organization and the necessity of working together at this time. He said: &quot;We have waited long for the critical time, and now it has come. Let us therefore meet it courageously and fearlessly.&quot; Some of the managers who had come from distant countries stated that this meeting and their attendance at the Basel convention was the greatest and happiest experience in their life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The wonderful meeting closed with song No. 101, which, in that great hall, sounded like a mighty triumphal song of victory and wherein all promised to raise the standard of the Lord until the victory is won, and the words of the refrain are still sounding in Our ears: &quot;Thus Baith Jehovah, I’ll strengthen and help thee; fear not, my people, to smite.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The inhabitants of Basel also received a great witness. Saturday forenoon about 700 workers covered the city and 200 worked outside. The territory was limited, because of Basel’s geographical situation, but, nevertheless, 537 books and 6,987 booklets were placed during the house-to-house service, and 1,000 booklets and 125 books were distributed at the time of the public meeting on Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The public meeting was well advertised. It was attended by over 2,000 strangers and over 1,500 friends. A Catholic newspaper warned the people against the lecture and said that the words of Jesus, * ' Flee into the mountains 1 ’ ’ were to be applied only to the time of the destruction of the city of Jeru-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■alem in A.D. 70; which is another proof of the faet that the clergy class cannot divide the word of truth properly, that they are blind and do not see the danger which is now upon ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ During the public meeting there was great quietness and remarkable attention. The Communists had distributed some leaflets before the meeting and they demanded a discussion, but they were prevented from causing any disturbance. Several men of the police force were also present at the meeting; also representatives of the Press, amongst them a representative of the German press, who had come from Geneva with the express purpose to attend this meeting. Two important newspapers, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">National-Zeitung</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Basler Nachnchten,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> brought in advance a short article concerning the meeting, and in this article certain misleading reports of the German press were set right and it was clearly pointed out that Jehovah’s witnesses have nothing to do with politics nor with any political organization. At the close of the public lecture the following Protest was adopted as a liesolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;For many years in the land of Germany Jehovah’s witnesses and faithful followers of Chnst Jesus, working unitedly under the direction of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have peaceably and earnestly engaged in bearing testimony to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God, end which preaching of the gospel has been of great aid and comfort to the people of that land. Duiing the past year the visible ruling powers of Germany known as the Hitler government without cause or excuse have wrongfully seized, confiscated and destroyed the Bibles, song books, furniture and other property of these faithful Christians, prohibited them to meet together and worship God according to His co</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mTnan</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">d-ments, and have cruelly persecuted and imprisoned many of such faithful Christians; and the rulers of said Hitler government, like Pharaoh of old, have wickedly opposed Jehovah God and defamed his holy name, and such visible ruling powers in that land by such wrongful actions have thus manifested the spirit of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Therefore,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> we, the followers of Christ Jesus and lovers of Jehovah God, assembled at Basel this 8th day of September, 1934, do most emphatically denounce and protest against the action of said Hitler government in persecuting persons because of their belief as barbaric, inhuman, anti-Christian and against Jehovah God and his Kingdom, and we call upon all fair-minded persons of good will throughout the earth to join with us in this denunciation and protest. We hold that the commandments of Jehovah God are superior to any rules made and promulgated by men and that all men should be free to worship and serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesus according to the divine commandments, as set forth in the Bible. We hereby register our protest by declaring ourselves against Satan and all persecution and oppression and by taking our stand on the Bide of and declaring ourselves for Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his anointed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The crowd of 3,500 enthusiastically voted in favor of this Resolution and adopted it by raising the nght arm and by giving a mighty and long applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a further means of publishing the gospel in Switzerland, transcription machines have been put in use and the lectures broadcast both in English and in German. Our local men there have been manufacturing these machines. By the end of the year 125 meetings with transcription machines had been held, with an attendance of 2,000 persons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s factory at Berne, Switzerland, headquarters of the Central European office, produces not only books for the territory above mentioned, but also much literature for Scandinavian territory. From the report of the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We printed literature in various languages, and, while the duty barriers and the fact that Switzerland holds to the gold standard have caused us some difficulties, we try with fair success to make up for these handicaps by zealous work and economy. Recently commercial treaties have been concluded between Switzerland and some other countries, such as Italy, Spam and Austria, which treaties are advantageous for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During this fiscal year our factory manufactured:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of the duty barriers orders to the amount of 355,000 booklets, for which we paid Francs 50,303.84, had to be given to worldly printing concerns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year two pioneers have been working under the immediate jurisdiction of the Society’s office at China. At the time of making up the report the placement of books by these pioneers has not been received. The local manager in Shanghai, together with the assistance of some others there, has placed during the year 11,183 books, the detailed report not having arrived to insert in this publication. During the year one radio station in Shanghai has regularly broadcast the Kingdom message every week, and the witness work is slowly but constantly increasing. The workers are few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Czechoslovakia embraces territory that was once the scene of much religious controversy, when the enemies of the truth were persecuting those in earlier times who were devoted to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. In the time of Huss, even though the truth was not so clear as now, many men were faithful to God in doing the best they could to serve him. There are doubtless great numbers of persons of good will in that country at the present time. The work in Czechoslovakia has progressed well during the year. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in that country is, to wit, 452,492. This is an increase of almost 150,000 over previous years. In previous years the greater portion of the work in that country was done by brethren who emigrated from other countries, but now these brethren must leave the country because of the enforcement of immigration laws, and so the work has been done chiefly by those who are natives and citizens. From the local manager’s report the following quotation is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Considering the increase of appreciating the name of Jehovah in this country, it is further stated that Czechoslovakia is a state of different nationalities, in which eight languages are spoken - Bohemian, Slovakian, German, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Rumanian and Polish. The work is directed in all these languages from the Prague office, and eight languages are, for this proportionally small country, of course, a remarkable difficulty, but it is wonderful to see how Jehovah, in all conditions where we would be unable to overcome the things, shows a way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Czechoslovakia has a population of about 16 million people, which means about 3.5 million families. In the past year 1,338,769 testimonies were given, so that more than each third family received a witness about the Kingdom. The number of literature obtainers was 405,719, so that more than each ninth family received a piece of literature. The number of hours worked was 173,445: the number of books distributed, 34,586; the number of the booklets distributed, 417,906; the number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> distributed, 150,000. This, for this proportionally small country, is surely a good witness and an appeal to all men of good will to take their stand on the side of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Many foreign brethren must, by circumstances already mentioned, leave the country, but pioneers of Czechoslovakian nationality took the place of the greater part of them. At the beginning of the fiscal year 104 pioneers were in the field. The number decreased, till in February there were only 77, but now again 93 pioneers are in the field. Because of the poverty of the people and other causes the pioneers have many difficulties and wants to bear, but they are going joyfully to the work, and Jehovah is blessing their efforts. Pioneers are active in the Bohemian, Slovakian, German, Hungarian and Ukrainian languages, and the correspondence of the Prague office must be handled in all these languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides the territories assigned to the companies, the country is divided into 124 pioneer territories. Of these, in 110 territories the witness was given wholly or for the greater part, in some of them two times, although in 14 territories the witness could not yet be given, or only for a small part. Now that some more brethren are coming on as pioneers, we can hope that in the next fiscal year the witness can be given in all territories of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies and Sharpshooters</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is remarkable to see how also in Czechoslovakia the Jona-dabs see their privileges and duties and that they begin to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his organization. At the end of this fiscal year there are in Czechoslovakia 155 companies and sharpshooters, to compare with 104 at the end of the preceding year. Further, there are some companies of interested fnends, and we hope that these also will soon take up the service work. These 155 companies and sharpshooters are of Bohemian, Slovakian, German, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Rumanian tongue. Bulletins and letters of instruction must be published in all these languages, except Rumanian, which, considering the small number of Rumanian friends, is translated to them by the Hungarian friends. The highest number of company workers was reached in March, in which month was the Thanksgiving Period. In this month the number was 898, yet the average number of company workers was 600. By the light from the temple the brethren now have a better understanding of their privileges, and also the work is now m a better organized shape than formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Of course, especially important in the service were the international service periods, and of these the Kingdom Period and the T</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hanksg</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">iving Period were the most important. The results of these two periods are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Testi- Ob-Kingdom Period Books Booklets Workers Hours monies tainers Sept. 30-Oct. 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;745 &nbsp;26,464 &nbsp;&nbsp;655 &nbsp;&nbsp;8,130 &nbsp;75,393 &nbsp;20,464</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thanksgiving Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Mar. 24-Apr. 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;673 &nbsp;32,961 &nbsp;1,019 &nbsp;11,713 &nbsp;95,605 &nbsp;28,781</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lectures out of the book Creation, supported by pictures and fi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lms</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, illustrating the creation and Biblical events till the vindication of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, held under the title “Creation Drama’’, were the means for a good witness in this country. This means has turned out very well here, because it is a good help for the partly primitive people to understand the printed and spoken word in a better way, and made it easier for many to understand the purpose of Jehovah and the establishment of his kingdom. Also with this means there was directed the appeal to many to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and further to read the books. The ' ‘ Creation Drama&quot; was shown in 41 places. The attendance was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25,305. 10,664 books and booklets were distributed on these occasions. That means that about every second person got something to read. 4,738 persons gave their addresses wishing to hear more about the truth. Now we have begun with the “Creation Drama” in the far east of the country, near the Rumanian border, where the Creation Dr</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ama</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is shown in Hungarian and Slovakian language, and we hope to Jehovah that also there it will go out as a great witness for his holy name. In this way the truth and the understanding of Jehovah's name is also increasing where low general education and the poverty of the people seemed to make it nearly impossible till now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">About the end of the fiscal year the organization of the work with the transcription records has started. There were already in some places transcription meetings. Some companies have bought a transcription mac</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e, and we hope that at the beginning of the new fiscal year ten transcription machines begin their work. Further, the work with the phonographs is now beginning. Also with the transcription records the work must be done in the named eight languages, because for several languages there are no brethren who are available for public service, and so it is a good help for the brethren not speaking one or another language of their territory, because this part of the people they reach by records. Where is no human (or no sufficient) tongue in all languages, there the Lord has in his wise provision given this means. It is our prayer that the Lord may bless also this part of the work in this country, that we can give next year a report of a great witness given by the transcription machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the beginning of the fiscal year a great persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses began in this country, surely because the Devil was angry about the increasing of the work. The Society’s office was searched under the indictment of espionage and a greater number of pioneers were arrested. All indictments brought against the Society and caused by the clergy, of course, could be seen to be wrong, and after the government had seen this, the persecution was stopped in the second part of the fiscal year, so that it can be said that at the moment the work can be done without greater difficulties. Of course, the pioneers in the whole country have to fight against the opposition and the persecution of the clergy, which do everything they can to hinder the distribution of the truth and to force men not to read the books. But, of course, Jehovah's witnesses go on with joy and zeal, notwithstanding all opposition. At the beginning of the fiscal year 281 proceedings against Jehovah’s witnesses in behalf of their work for Jehovah’s name were pending; new during the fiscal year 101, finished during the fiscal year 182, so that there are pending at the end or the fiscal year 200. Of the finished proceedings, in 142 cases the defendants got free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Outlook</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the end of the fiscal year we received the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bight-eous Euler.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The message contained therein has caused the greatest enthusiasm among the brethren. We have the conviction that they with very great zeal will go on in this work, and we hope Jehovah may help us that in the next year a witness may be given in this country as never before. Jehovah our gracious God be thanked for all occasions of service which he has given us, and foremost that we still have in this country the opportunity to work for his holy name. We are determined to use all opportunities which the Lord gives us for his glorification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DANZIG</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to 1914 Danzig was a part of the German Empire. Since 1920 it has been a free state under the protectorate of the League of Nations. Because of difficulties in Germany the work in Danzig was recently assigned to the Central European office. There are about 200 of Jehovah’s witnesses residing in Danzig, who are quite diligent. During the year they have, while advertising the King and the Kingdom, distributed 1,869 books and 57,440 booklets, and placed in the hands of the people 21,993 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> The local manager reports, “Several times an officer of the law named ‘Teuffel’ (which, translated into English, means ‘devil’) appeared at the Danzig office and confiscated two issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.” </span><span class="font5">We presume the Devil did not get much satisfaction out of those confiscated issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year has seen a blessing upon the publication of the Kingdom message in Denmark. During the year there has been a decided and healthy increase, although the depression has increased amongst the people. Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark, like those in other parts of the earth, have the zeal peculiar to the Lord and amidst handicaps and other opposition push forward in the work. The publication of the Kingdom message in that land during the fiscal year aggregates books and booklets to the number of 345,987. The local manager, m summing up the publication work in the land of Denmark, among other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our quota in Denmark waa 300 brethren out each week, 600,000 testimonies, 112,000 hours, 22,000 books, 250,000 booklets, 12,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions and 35,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">copies. Actually we managed 278 out weekly, our highest number so far; 101,044 hours, 632,728 testimonies, 19,308 books, 326,679 booklets, 10,972 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions and 58,076 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies. In this work the general experience has been that the testimony cards were a real help in the successful presentation of the message. Those with no interest in the message were automatically put on one side by themselves, while the brethren were thus enabled to concentrate on those who had some interest and so to hold out longer in the work. Our </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">en Hoc</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> result for all literature spread exceeded last year’s by no less than 37 percent. This shows it is good to have a mark and to strive to reach it. There is an increase in numbers out, in testimonies, in hours, in booklets, in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions and copies, and on bound books alone there was a small decrease of 4 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The 53 companies organized for service, together with isolated brethren, spread 211,776 books and booklets m their spare time from purely altruistic motives, and additionally did a good deal of work for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the March “week” the result attained in Copenhagen was specially noteworthy, for on that occasion 168 of the Jehu company, assisted by 34 of the Jonadab company, spread 22,211 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have had 47 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> representatives and auxiliaries busy during the year, and apart from their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> work these placed 128,905 books and booklets. The work of going from house to house in their spare time in all weathers is by no means easy, but the Lord has richly blessed all their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The four regional service directors have been busy all the year, for, as you understand, the majority of the companies are but tiny and require help from time to time with the details of the organization method, which they gladly give. Additionally, they give talks on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> articles, lead </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> studies, and are also out in the work with the friends. Their life is a full and happy one, for they also take meetings for the Jonadab fnends, and it is enthusing to see the alacrity with which these spring up into the chariot and associate themselves with the work. It is a source of deep joy and great encouragement to the Jehu class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Many, many of the Jonadabs have been interested by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is surely a wonderful means of furthering the Kingdom interests. It was effectively used in connection with Hitler’s persecution of our brethren in Germany, for in July we printed a 42,000 edition, which has been placed in the hands *of the people. Without doubt that article will have had its due effect upon all who read it, and, as Denmark is Germany’s neighbor, it had great interest for the people here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the land of Egypt, the seat of the first universal empire, the gospel is now being published under the immediate direction of Greek brethren, by the direction of the Society from headquarters. Twenty lectures by radio have been delivered, other lectures published in the newspapers and distributed to the number of 14,500, while books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the hungry people to the number of 440. The people are quite poor, but some of them are very anxious to have the message of the truth. From the local representative’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In my territory I have Armenians with whom I converse in the French or English language to introduce myself. The interest shown by them is quite great, and so I was enabled to place in their hands in 22 days, by the Lord’s grace, upward of 440 books and booklets, in spite of the great poverty amongst them. It is certain that if an Arme</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nia</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n brother would be here he could form a company, because there are many Jonadabs among them. Some of them have confessed to me that they read the booklets over and over two and three times, and in such a case I am enabled to place with them bound books. Another told me that he read two booklets in one night; and another that he kept reading until the morning hours; and another, again, who was very poor, much enthused from the reading of two booklets, got all the books and booklets and gave me his address to provide him with any other new publication that would be issued by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTONIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publication of the Kingdom message in Estonia has increased during the fiscal year, and this to the great encouragement of the faithful witnesses who are there engaged in the service. During the year the Roman Catholic hierarchy sent from the Vatican its representative to Estonia. At once the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses increased there, of course. So everywhere, the Devil uses the Roman Catholic hierarchy as his chief instrument for persecution, but in the face of all this the work goes grandly on. The responsibility upon these black birds, however, is fixed, and the Lord in his due time will fully recompense them. The distribution of the literature in that country, carrying the Kingdom message, reached a total of 62,213. The following extracts are taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a great pleasure to again report a healthy increase in the activities of the Kingdom. The number of workers has grown from 10 to 21, resulting in the spread of nearly 19,000 more pieces of literature than were placed last year. The number of hours spent in the field is 16,451, whereas in the previous year it was 13,409. Just as the Lord would have it, many more people than ever before have had the vital importance of this witness work and their relation to it brought squarely to their notice; nearly eighty-four thousand people have themselves read the pointed testimonies presented to them. It is always a joy to dispatch literature to the field as well as to have a share in the distribution of it. During the year 62,213 pieces of literature, mostly booklets, have been sent out from the depot. This is an increase of 15,351 pieces over last year’s figure. Surely the Lord is bringing forth his judgment unto the nations by the hand of his ‘servant’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Apart from the national tongue, the Russian language is understood by more people than any other. This factor has, till very recently, made it difficult to get into close contact with a certain part of the population. Now, however, three Russians have become interested and are taking up the woik. Two of these are pioneers, and, with the more recently translated booklets, they are be</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ginning</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to make an impression on the Russians in this country. Ten other pioneers have constantly and regularly carried out their commission to ‘preach the gospel of the Kingdom’, and this noteworthy fact is made manifest by their placing 51,907 books and booklets with the people. Two brethren worked for a short time as auxiliary pioneers and enlarged the total amount of literature spread by 744 pieces. The companies here are small in number, but large in faith and in persistent efforts to point the way to the Kingdom. Some of the brethren are isolated, but this has not lessened their enthusiasm. Together with the members of the companies, thirteen in all, they have added 3,538 books and booklets to the grand total, while ‘Jonadabs’ to the average number </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of 5</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have extended the witness still wider by spreading literature to the quantity of 3,825 pieces. At the depot there have been many inquiries for literature, and the fulfilling of these requests for the Kingdom message has augmented the yearly output by 981 books and booklets. The grand total of literature spread was 60,995 pieces. Of this number only about thirteen hundred were books, while the greater part of the remainder was composed of campaign booklets. As conditions are at present it isn’t easy to place books and at the same time clear the shipments of the booklets that have come in such rapid succession. However, the warning to “Christendom” is being clearly sounded in no uncertain tones; the meek are learning righteousness and the way of escape from impending doom, and the name of Jehovah is being exalted. This is the feature of paramount importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publication of the Kingdom message in Finland has also increased during the year. It is reported that the economic conditions there are very bad and the people have great difficulty in existing; but when persons are in distress they begin to think of what is the cause of the same, and, since God’s Word holds the only explanation, it is to be expected that more will turn their attention to the examination of the Scripture truths. During the year there has been distributed, and thereby published, the Kingdom message to the number of 287,183 books and booklets. The local manager makes a comprehensive report, and from his report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our enemies have marveled how we can with such a courage do the work, although such laws have been passed which highly have hindered their work. The fascist party has many times threatened us. They have said that if they only got the control over the matters in our country they shall sweep away our movement. They succeeded to have our parliament to pass a law by which they hoped to quiet all those who were not with them, but the Lord says: “Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense.' ’ And now it has gone so that the law which the fascists hoped to help them to put restrictions upon others has been applied upon themselves, and even their main paper has been many times prohibited to appear at all, and also at present it has been stopped for an uncertain time. fio the dear Lord has protected our work and we have had the joy to place much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Books</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the hands of the people: The whole quantity has been 287,183 books and booklets, which exceeds 33 percent Increase compared with the previous year. This year we have </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">go</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">t the following new books and booklets: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> II, Final </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">War, Good News, Who Is God? Escape to the Kingdom, Dividing the People,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Recovery.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reprinted have been: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Song Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have both appeared twice a month and brought us the Kingdom news, which have Such a great stimulating and encouraging effect upon all who have fully consecrated themselves to the Lord and who are also trying to faithfully follow the instructions given by the dear Lord through his chosen channel. It is very remarkable and wonderful to see how only those who keep the command* meats of the Lord are privileged to see the great and thrilling truths which now for the first time are fully opened before the eyes of the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A great help during the year has been our httle printery in our new house. The following figures show what has been done during the year: 313,100 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Ages,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 33,630 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 15,955 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 78,000 folders with message, 20,133 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Is God?</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1,600 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Song Books,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 200,005 forms, posters, etc ; or, together, 662,423 copies of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been a powerful means in our hands, helping the work forward, and the brothers handling the machines have become more skilled to do a better and quicker work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The radio</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Tallinn did several years’ good work even in our country, and the truth was heard all over, but the clergy were angry and two years ago they wrote in their biggest paper that the minister for foreign affairs in our country should ask the minister of foreign affairs in Estonia to stop the Finnish lectures; but nothing was done, before the Roman church sent its representative. He started such a powerful attack against our lectures that the government took the whole station, which formerly had been owned by private persons, and at once our lectures were stopped. For that reason the work with transcription machines in our country would now be of great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Our new home</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has been in many ways a great blessing for the work. It has not only helped us to make the arrangements for the work much better, but also financially it has helped us so that the rent has gone down almost 40 percent. Although it has been a hard time, yet many fnends have seen their opportunities and have given donations so that we have been able to pay our expenses, which in a bttle, thinly populated -country are comparatively great. It might also be mentioned that this house silently testifies to the unity of the brethren everywhere, for a third of its cost was subscribed in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have now been gatherings in order to encourage brethren to the work. For that reason the service work has been the main feature of the conventions, and every one can realize that a convention now without service would be a failure. It is just the service which makes the conventions now to be feasts of joy. During the year there have been held, all together, 46 local conventions and one main convention in Helsinki. As it was just immediately after the fine London convention, we were able to bring to the friends fresh greetings and stimulating news, and we had a real fine convention here also, resulting in the big output of literature of 4,037, which is the greatest figure so far at any convention in our country. The whole output at the conventions has been 21,403, and 43 have been baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers and auxiliaries</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have tried during the year to visit even the most remote places of our country. It has been a tiresome and very hard work, as the ways are poor and the distances between the houses so great that only few houses during the day can be reached. Only the peculiar zeal for the Lord can help a human creature to do the work with joy and endurance. Anyhow, the dear workers, 69 pioneers and auxiliaries, have had the privilege to leave in the hands of the people 103,514 copies of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Companies and sharpshooters</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have done more than half of the whole work done in Finland during last year. Many of them have come to very nice results. The whole amount of literature placed by them was 174,628. The brethren at Bethel have, during their free time, with zeal taken part in the service work, and during the big campaigns the office has always sent as many brothers as possible to lead friends in other companies to work. The office family of 14 brethren has had the joy to leave 14,883 copies of literature in the hands of those who appreciate the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Beqional service directors</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have visited companies and isolated friends in order to encourage them, and it is a pleasure for me to state that they have with great zeal in the service given a good pattern and their visits have been appreciated. The average of literature spread has been 3,659 during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The International Service Periods</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> are always great feasts. There is no doubt that it has pleased our great King to specially bless the service during such times. We have never before had so many out in the work as during the big last spring period. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ab</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a good many, more than we have permit-holders took part in the work, it was apparent that many Jonadabs have been taken up into the chariot. Seemingly the work with Jonadabs just before us will be of special interest. It is grand to see how the mighty and beautiful Bong to the honor of Jehovah Almighty, sung during several years by the Lord's anointed, sets other hearts to thrill and they also join in praising the eternal God. The whole output during these weeks has been 102,707.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishing of the gospel of the Kingdom in France has been attended with many hardships suffered by brethren there who are not citizens of that country. Shortly following the World War the French government encouraged many citizens of Poland to emigrate to France and gave them employment in working the mines, and other work, in northern France. A number of these Polish people came in contact with the message of the Kingdom and accepted it and used their spare time in preaching the gospel. Although they have rendered splendid service to the French government, and there is no complaint made by the French government of their work, yet many of these Poles, because of their devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom and their distribution of the literature bearing the message, have been expelled from France. Many of these have been left without employment and with no means of support and with no money to return to their native land. A great hardship has been worked upon them. The French government also expelled Germans and English citizens who were there engaged in the pioneer service. This has made it difficult for the work to be carried on as successfully as had been hoped. In spite of this harsh treatment and expulsion and the workers’ having been greatly reduced, the gospel of the Kingdom has been published in France during the year as follows: Books, 52,307; booklets, 568,579; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> 278,889; Bibles, 1,523. In addition to the above, the office at Paris furnished individuals during the year the following: Books, 1,392; booklets, 11,754, this making a total distribution in France during the year, of books, 53,699; booklets, 580,333.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the month of September, 1933, we were invited to participate in an Exposition, where we could show and place our literature. Such expositions being always attended by many thousands of people, we thought this would be a good opportunity to display our books and to draw the attention of the people to our work and to the radio lectures. We were very pleased when hundreds of visitors stated that they regularly listen in to radio stations </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Radio-Vitus</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Radio-LL</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> m order to hear our lectures. Great was our surprise when about two weeks later we received from the Exposition Committee a Diploma with Gold Medal for religious writings. This encouraged us to participate in another exposition just before ‘ ‘ Christmas ’and this time the Society was awarded a Diploma of Honour with Golden Medal and Cross of the City of Pans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As our purpose in participating in these expositions was not to get diplomas, we wrote to the Exposition Committee, asking why the Society was awarded these distinctions, whereupon we received the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ART—COMMERCE—INDUSTRY—GASTRONOMY—HYGIENE Expositions organised for the welfare and with the help of social works of charity placed under Important and high political patronage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paris,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> January 20, 1934.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To the Director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SIR:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your few lines of December 30 last year, which were addressed to our colaborer, Mr. Louis Cnblet, who transmitted your message to us in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Today we have the pleasure of answering it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Diplomas which have been appointed to you at the occasion of the expositions in September and December 1933 have been delivered as a recompense for the moral value of your work and the indisputable honesty shining forth from your literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With pleasure I remember here a conversation which took place at the time of the last exposition with regard to the propaganda in which you are actively engaged for the general welfare, when one of our principal colaborers expressed himself as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The literature of the “Tour de Garde” is a symbol of honesty, loyalty and courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I make use of this opportunity to address to you my personal felicitation, assuring you of my best wishes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This letter shows that these diplomas were awarded the Society not because of the outward appearance of our books, but because of their contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We then wrote a letter to the president of the City of Paris thanking </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> therefor; we also sent </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He replied as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MUNICIPAL COUNCIL THE FRENCH REPUBLIC OF PARIS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Liberty — Equality — Fraternity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Paris, March 24, 1934,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To the Director of the Tour de Garde, Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sb:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I am much moved by the contents of the letter which you addressed to me. I thank you very much for your attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yours faithfully, ^(Signature) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rene Fiquet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We had never thought that these diplomas, given to us by men, might ever be of much help to us, since we place all our hope in Jehovah and in his Anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In February very great difficulties arose which grieved the hearts of the ra</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">m min</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">t of this country, especially about the time of the Memorial and the Service Period which followed it. A circular letter issued by the Ministry of the Interior, dated February 27, stated our writings to be “subversive” and ordered the police and the gendarmerie (national guards) to expel from France all colaborers of the Tour de Garde who would be found distributing the writings of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Particularly the Polish companies and the pioneers were in danger. These were immediately informed of the decision of the Government and it was decided to continue the work m spite of these measures, but to do it with greater precaution than ever before. It is interesting to see that in this year we had more workers than ever before This because some believed that the opportunities of service might cease and they awoke out of their sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We immediately took the necessary steps and referred with some measure of success to the diplomas which we had been awarded. In other countries as well, good use was made of them in order to overcome difficulties or to improve conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to bring the matter to a head, we informed the Ministry of the Interior that we would display our writings again in an exposition in April. We did not meet with any difficulties but to our surprise received the highest award, namely, the “Diploma of the Great Prize with Cross and Medal<sup>1</sup>'. The three diplomas we hung in the office of the Society and also published facsimiles thereof m </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Especially the clergy, who often claim our writings to be worthless and making the people ignorant, thus got a blow, for each witness now shows the people in the house-to-house service a small facsimile of the diplomas as well as of the letter above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus the enemy, despite all the difficulties he caused Jehovah’s witnesses, was not able to discourage them and to lessen their zeal. His opposition led God’s people to a more faithful devotion, for no one wanted to be in the rear when the call went out: “Who is for Jehovah’’ Even the expulsions which have taken place since March were not able to dampen the diligence and courage of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Polish brethren expelled know that other opportunities of service will be given them m their home country. Jehovah is pleased with such faithfulness and therefore has blessed our small efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This office is unable to report any definite account of work done in the publication of the gospel within the borders of Germany during the fiscal year. That there has been considerable witness work done there is no doubt, and this has had to be done under adverse conditions and such a handicap that reports are practically impossible. Amidst all the persecution that has been heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany the more zealous and faithful ones have braved these storms and gone ahead with their work, spending part of the time in prison and, as soon as released, again going at the work. Others have been fearful and have done less or nothing. The cruel persecution heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany has tried them very severely. Doubtless there is no country on earth that has gone to the extremes similar to that of the Hitler government. Manifestly that man is under the direct supervision of the Devil and is his special representative on the earth. Fraudulently claiming to represent Christ Jesus he persecutes everyone who serves Jesus Christ and Jehovah God in truth and in faithfulness. The books and other literature of Jehovah’s witnesses for the publication of the Kingdom message have been seized and many of them destroyed during the year. Many of these faithful followers of Christ Jesus have been put in concentration camps or other prisons and woefully ill-treated because they refuse to vote for Hitler or refuse to hail him as the savior of mankind. The faithful ones have determined to remain true and loyal to Jehovah God and take whatever punishment God permits to be inflicted upon them. This is the only way whereby the final test can be put upon any people in maintaining their integrity towards Jehovah. It may be confidently expected that in God’s due time not only will he punish the persecutors of his witnesses, as he has promised, but he will fully release all of the faithful witnesses in Germany and give them further opportunity of making known his gracious Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of German brethren crossed the border to Switzerland and attended the convention at Basel. These were greatly encouraged and enthused to go back and engage in the work again. Returning to Germany many of these were arrested and incarcerated in prison. Mail that is sent to them is seized; mail that is sent to this office is seized, and is never delivered. The German government attempts to prevent any communication between those who are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">United Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During September 1934 it was determined that an effort should be made for a united action of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout Germany and that they would continue to publish the truth. This arrangement was made by a letter’s being addressed by the president of the Society to all the companies in Germany, and special messengers were sent to each company to deliver this letter and to prepare for the meeting or meetings that were to be held throughout Germany at a date certain. Following is the letter addressed to all of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">My beloved Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">You have heretofore made a covenant to do the will of God. He has taken, you at your word, begotten you as His own, and called you to his kingdom. Christ Jesus at the temple of God has gathered unto himself the faithful and taken them into the covenant for God’s kingdom. Such faithful ones God has anointed and commissioned to be his witnesses. It is to such that this letter is addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, whom God raised up as his great Prophet, and now all who are of the anointed remnant must render complete obedience to God’s great Prophet, Christ Jesus. (Acts 3: 22,23) The commandments of Jehovah and of his great Prophet to the anointed, among others, are these: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God’; 'go and tell the people’; 'this gospel of the kingdom must be preached as a witness'; ‘forsake not the assembling of yourselves together’; ‘study to show yourselves approved unto God'; “shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.&quot;—Isaiah 43: 10-12; Isaiah 6:9; Matthew 24: 14; Hebrews 10: 25; 2 Timothy 2: 15; 1 Peter 2: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Contrary to and in violation of the foregoing positive commandments from Jehovah God the government of Germany has forbidden you to meet together and worship Jehovah and serve him. Whom will you obey: God or men! The faithful apostles were placed in a similar position, and to the worldly rulers they said: &quot;Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. We ought to obey God rather than men.&quot; (Acts 4: 13-20; Acts 5: 29) No man has the right to command you concerning God’s service. You are duty-bound by your covenant to obey God and Christ. I conclude, therefore, that you will obey Jehovah, and not man. I therefore advise as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Let every company of Jehovah’s witnesses within the land of Germany meet at some convenient place in the town where you reside on Sunday morning October 7, 1934, at nine o’clock; that this communication be read to the assembled company; that you all then join together in prayer unto God, asking his guidance, protection and deliverance and blessings through Christ Jesus our Head and King; that you then immediately send a prepaid telegram to the government officials of Germany a copy of which is prepared and will be ready; that you then devote a brief period to the study of Matthew 10: 16-24; that doing this you all ‘stand for your life’ (Esther 8: 11); and that then the meeting adjourn and that you go out among your neighbors and bear testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your brethren throughout the earth will have you in mind and at the same time will be asking a similar prayer of Jehovah. United in the holy cause of righteousness and rendering ourselves fully in obedience unto God and his kingdom we may look with complete confidence for deliverance and blessing from God by and through Chnst Jesus hiB great Vindicator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Be assured of my love and best wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your brother and servant by his grace, (Signed) J. F. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preparation was made in accordance with this suggestion for the meeting of all companies in Germany on the 7th of October, at which meeting the foregoing letter was read to those assembled. Thereafter the following message by telegram addressed to the German government was sent by each one, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">the Officials of the Government:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Word of Jehovah God, as set out in the Holy Bible, is the supreme law, and to us it is our sole guide for the reason that we have devoted ourselves to God and are true and sincere followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the past year, and contrary to God's law and in violation of our rights, you have forbidden us as Jehovah’s witnesses to meet together to study God’s Word and worship and serve him. In his Word he commands us that we shall not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. (Hebrews 10: 25) To us Jehovah commands: 'Ye are my witnesses that I am God. Go and tell the people my message.' (Isaiah 43: 10,12; Isaiah 6:9; Matthew 24: 14) There is a direct conflict between your law and God’s law, and, following the lead of the faithful apostles, &quot;we ought to obey God rather than men,&quot; and this we will do. (Acts 5: 29) Therefore this is to advise you that at any cost we will obey God’s commandments, will meet together for the study of his Word, and will worship and serve him as he has commanded. If your government or officers do violence to ns because we are obeying God, then our blood will be upon you and you will answer to Ahmghty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have no interest in political affairs, but are wholly devoted to God’s kingdom under Christ his King. We will do no injury or harm to anyone. We would delight to dwell in peace and do good to all men as we have opportunity, but, since your government and its officers continue in your attempt to force us to disobey the highest law of the universe, we are compelled to now give you notice that we will, by his grace, obey Jehovah God and fully trust </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to deliver us from all oppression and oppressors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah's witnesses </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at---------------------</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Acting in full unity with and in support of their brethren in Germany, Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth assembled in their respective meeting places on October 7, 1934, and after presenting themselves before Jehovah in supplication through Christ Jesus each company of Jehovah’s witnesses in America, Canada, Great Britain, Continental Europe, France, Switzerland, and other places, sent to the Hitler government the following cablegram:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">------------, Oct. 7, 1934. Hitler Government,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Berlin, Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses shocks all good people of earth and dishonors God's name. Refrain from further persecuting Jehovah's witnesses; otherwise God will destroy you and your national party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses, -------------</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just what effect this will have upon the German government no opinion is ventured. That, however, is not the important thing. That which is of vital importance to Jehovah’s witnesses today is that they stand shoulder to shoulder, fully united for God and for his kingdom, bearing testimony before the world that Jehovah is God and Christ is King. Jehovah, having taken out his people from the world as witnesses to his name, must carry forward the work of publishing his kingdom. The real objective of sending these messages to the Hitler government is to serve notice upon those cruel oppressors that Jehovah’s witnesses will serve God and not man, and will be faithful to Jehovah and his kingdom and take whatever consequences come, fully trusting in God, who is able to deliver them and who will deliver them in his own due time. These faithful ones count not their earthly lives dear to them. They have an obligation to perform because they have sworn allegiance to God and to his kingdom. They have no desire or inclination to do injury to other creatures, but they must and will serve Jehovah by telling out his truth as he has commanded them. In doing this they are but faithfully following in the footsteps of Jesus, who earnestly and faithfully proclaimed the truth to the very last when on earth. Now in this end of the world Christ Jesus has committed unto the remnant his testimony, and these are commanded by Jehovah God as his witnesses to deliver this testimony, and they well know that Satan the Devil violently opposes them and will continue to oppose them until the great conflict is fought at Armageddon, in which Christ as Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer will gain the victory, end all oppression, and establish righteousness in the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this report is being written information is just now received, of which the following is the substance: In some of the continental countries of Europe the postoffice that relays the telegrams refused to accept the telegrams for transmission, but the same message was immediately transmitted to Berlin by letter. At first the Berlin authorities refused to receive telegrams that were sent from some of the countries, wiring that they could not be delivered on account of Section 26 of the International Postal Agreement. Later the Berlin authorities sent out another wire which reads as follows: “Cancel our first wire. Your telegrams were later delivered to the Hitler </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Regierung.”</span><span class="font5"> Thus the evidence is furnished that the telegrams reached their destination. On Tuesday night following a radio communication was broadcast from Berlin, in which the statement, in substance, was made: ‘Thousands of telegrams were received in Berlin from a certain brotherhood, and this has made a great impression. ’ Other information coming through from Germany and just now received is to the following effect: “On October 7 in Germany all things were organized as ordered and Jehovah overruled the matter that the brethren in the whole country could assemble at the determined hour. The brethren were very enthusiastic about the special letter to Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and voted unanimously for the Resolution to be sent to the Hitler government. Following the sending of the message to the Hitler government the brethren went out and engaged in the house-to-house witness work. At Magdeburg the whole family were in the field and the Lord blessed them very much. One meeting was dissolved by police, but no one arrested.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The information concerning Germany in general is quite meager at this time. But, regardless of what that information discloses, the important thing is that Jehovah’s witnesses have tried to prove their faithfulness to Him and to maintain their integrity toward Him and his kingdom. These faithful ones will now have in mind the words of admonition by the apostle, which were appropriate in the early days and which are now even more appropriate, to wit: “Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ; that, whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.”—Phil. 1: 27-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early part of the Christian Era the gospel was carried into Greece. It challenged the enemy organization. In modern times the gospel is being published in Greece, and it likewise challenges the present evil ruling power. The opposition to the Kingdom message is very great, and, because Satan observes that the truth is making inroads upon him and exposes the nefarious work of his agencies, it is very difficult to get books into Greece. So the Society is required to print much of its literature there. During the year there was placed in the hands of the people the published Kingdom message, books and booklets, covered and in paper binding, to the number of 172,697.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Albania is really a part of the Greek territory and the work is done in the Greek language, and there the message was published to the number of 3,435.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is extracted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is true that the financial condition of the people, and especially in the country districts, is going from bad to worse, and the clergy find opportunity to attribute all this to the spreading of the truth, and try to persuade the people to burn the books. How true the words of Brother Rutherford in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> “When the humble and timid one in the church organization obtains a book explaining the truths of the Bible, and the clergyman learns this fact, he urges that the book be destroyed.” This happens daily in the work; still the Lord is able to turn man’s wrath to His glory. Lately some brethren went to a small town to give the message, and the priest, having heard of this, spoke in the church urging the people not to buy any of the books. The people misunderstood his words and they thought that he recn</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ended to them the books as good; so when the brethren visited them they were eager to get the booklets, saying that the priest recommended the books to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are in the field 5 regular pioneers spending all their time in the witness work, and 5 other brethren spending part of their time. It is true that the work out in the country is very difficult for the brethren, because there are no traveling facilities, and the brethren suffer very much. Many times they have to walk long distances, carrying the load of the books with them, and, after doing the work there, they are compelled to return because they have nowhere to stay at night. During the winter, which was unusually severe in Greece, two brethren in the work, as they returned on foot, were compelled to sleep in the wood, and were in danger of being devoured by wolves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only a few months prior to the end of the fiscal year Hawaii was under the immediate direction of the Brooklyn office. Now a branch office has been opened at Honolulu, and this office will have jurisdiction over all the Hawaiian Islands. The witness work has progressed to some degree, but we hope greater results will be obtained during the ensuing year. During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 11,321. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Now we have mapped out the territory for them and started a territory assignment system, so that a record will be had of where each one is working and what he places, and enable a thorough witness to be given. Under the former arrangement parts of the city were rarely covered, and other parts were gone over and over many times. Also, each worker will have a definite individual territory, and will feel more keenly the responsibility for taking the testimony to the people in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Transcription meetings:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Nine meetings were held, with a total attendance of 246, at which 31 booklets and one book were placed. By the Lord’s grace more will be accomplished next month, since much time was taken up fixing up the book room and office. Also, we now have a car, m which we have mounted the transcription machine, and this will make more meetings possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOLLAND (THE NETHERLANDS)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Holland continues to push steadfastly forward in publishing the message of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ. The numbers are few, but their zeal is peculiar to the Lord’s house. They love God and serve him, and this they do in the face of opposition, as indeed they could not do otherwise and at the same time be faithful to Jehovah God. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year, there were on an average 76 company workers, 34 pioneers and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> auxiliaries in the field, or a total of 115 workers, to compare with 88 during the previous year. This means an increase of 32 regular workers. It is encouraging to see that the work was done with greater zeal and joy than formerly, and this made it possible, by the grace of the Lord, to place more literature in the hands of the people than during any previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here are some figures regarding the work done by the pioneers and the companies:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Added to this, the office delivered to individuals, books, 517; booklets, 1,433; making a total for the year for Holland of 156,466. Added to that, copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were distributed, bringing the total up to 281,373 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are but small companies of witnesses of Jehovah in Holland. The 76 regular company workers belong to 12 companies. The number of attendants at the company meetings exceeds that of the workers by about 10 percent. On the other hand there are also some Jonadabs who help to carry the message of the Kingdom to the people. Some of them regularly send in money accompanied by a list of names and addresses to which we are to send literature. This is an encouragement for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There were five service periods during this year. In these 80 company workers put in 3,563 hours and distributed 131 books, 9,323 booklets, and 2,327 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies; giving a total of 30,544 testimonies, obtainers, 10,719.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The average number of 33 pioneers and 5 auxiliaries participating in these special campaigns worked 10,145 hours and placed 879 books, 29,500 booklets and 4,793 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies, giving thereby 135,916 testimonies. The number of obtainers was 32,122.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A comparison of these figures with those for the whole year discloses the interesting fact that during the service periods the brethren worked literally with double zeal. In many cases, too, more than double results were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Those facts justify our hope that it will be possible to obtain still better results during the coming year, if all continually are animated with a fiery zeal for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecutions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As mentioned already in the previous annual report, the enemy is very angry because of the progress of the work, and he resorts to any means in order to find men who will do his bidding, whom he may use in his efforts to stop the witness work. In southern Holland (Noord-Brabant) we had a pioneer home. The people in this part of the country are almost exclusively Catholics, and for two years a thorough and strong witness went out to these from the pioneer home. There had always been efforts made with a view of stopping this work, but they had been of no avail. Then a new Minister of Justice entered the government, and this one gave heed to the accusations of the clergy, in that we were threatened that if the work were continued in that district all the foreign pioneers would be expelled. At the same time an order was issued forbidding further pioneers of foreign nationality from entering the country. No doubt the Devil intended to have all the foreign pioneers expelled and to thus stop the work, because there would have been no possibility of replacing the expelled workers and because the witness is almost exclusively given by foreign pioneers. However, he did not consider that Jehovah’s time to give the warning witness had not yet expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There is as good as no opportunity in this country of giving the witness over the radio. The only opportunity to broadcast a lecture is granted us when the president of the Society appears personally. The enemy knows that this does not happen often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We hope that the transcription machines will to some extent be a substitute for the radio lectures. We expect to be able to start with this work during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Prospects for the Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Every year we have tried to look into the future, and our joyful hope for the further prosperity of the work has always been fulfilled. Each year greater unemployment, heavier burdens upon the people, and m spite of this the witness work has increased year by year. Jehovah blesses His work. The Devil, however, does not remain inactive; which is shown by the fact that recently some new laws have been enacted regarding the “protection and security of the State”, according to which one is forbidden to insult or to vex by pictures, by books and by word of mouth, certain classes of people (read: the clergy).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year there were four employees working in the office, two of them only half-days. These did aU the office work, including the translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If those who think have had any doubt that Satan is governing this wicked world and keeping the people in the dark by the use of religion, a knowledge of what goes on at the present time against Jehovah’s witnesses would remove all such doubt. Before the War Hungary and Austria were operating under the same government and the Roman Catholic hierarchy was uppermost in religious matters, exercising its powerful influence amongst the politicians and commercial wings of the government. When Jehovah sent his witnesses into that land to enlighten the people, the enemy attacked them with great viciousness, and has kept it up since. In the face of this cruel persecution, during the year that is past, people of good will received into their hands books and booklets to the number of, to wit, 79,448. The local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> meetings of friends were forbidden, and even when the friends came together in a secret manner they were oftentimes found by the police, and then some of the friends got hard blows, and were thrown into prison and other things were done to them. Under these circumstances, to organize the witness work was impossible. But under Jehovah 'a protection within the past year several changes came np in this. The fanaticism of persecuting the friends stopped in several places, and energetic efforts were made to go on with the work. Our gracious God Jehovah gave his blessings, and the result is that in the past fiscal year an enormous increase of the distribution figures is to be seen, viz, an increase of the distribution figures for the booklets, 1,000 percent, and the distribution figures of the books, 50 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">More than 50 percent of the distributed literature, namely, 35,769 pieces, was distributed in the capital town of the country, Budapest, and surroundings. The reason is, of course, that In the capital town the authorities are more tolerant than iff smaller places. So the fnends here can work better and do not have to suffer so much under the intolerance as in ether places in the country. Nine pioneers and 30 company workers are working in Budapest and surroundings, and from this central point of the country now this influence goes out gradually to the friends in the country, not to fear the enemy, but to go on, praying the Lord that he may protect everybody who is active in the witness work. The light of the temple encourages the friends, so that now Jehovah’s witnesses learn better that Jehovah is God and that he protects everyone who trusts </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Booksellers’ Shops</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A special Press law of the country gives permission for distribution of books only by regular booksellers’ shops. Therefore we organized in the whole country booksellers' shops with small rooms, and from there the friends can get books and booklets and distribute them in the surroundings of the shops. Until now we have seven such shops in Hungary. We shall look for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Of course, today Jehovah’s witnesses still have to suffer under great opposition, and the reason for persecuting the friends also in this country is to be found in the clergy’s circles, which are bringing to the authorities false indictments against Jehovah's witnesses. Twenty-four proceedings were pending in Hungary in the past year. Nine cases were finished and the friends got free, and m twelve cases the friends were punished because they either came together and studied Jehovah’s Word and prayed to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or because they were going and giving witness for his name. Even the highest court punished a sister with five days in prison, only because she loaned to a friend of hers a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earp of God.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In different places of the country, especially places where the influence of the Catholic priests is strong, today the fnends still cannot openly come together, not even to pray to God and study his Word. In other places the policemen, when the friends leave their houses, follow them, looking to see if they meet any other friend in his house, and if so, they come in and push them out. In these places two of the friends cannot yet come together. Notwithstanding, the friends are joyful and willing to go on, knowing that Jehovah is stronger than all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At present 16 pioneers and 4 auxiliaries and 303 company workers are working, to compare with 7 pioneers and 80 company workers in the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population of Iceland is very small. The opportunity to publish the message of the Kingdom is likewise much restricted. During the year 3,893 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Armageddon approaches, Jehovah continues to send his witnesses out to make a wider publication of the Kingdom, and thus more people in the benighted countries are enabled to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. The work in India, carried on with many difficulties there and greatly handicapped both because of the climate and because of opposition from the enemy, has progressed even though a small number have been engaged in publishing the message of the Kingdom. Under the blistering sun, amidst the dust and filth in that benighted land, the faithful brethren push forward. Brethren who have gone from England to that country have bravely met these conditions and have been going forward during the year with great zeal for the Lord and his kingdom. Being weakened often in their physical strength by virtue of the many hardships, the Lord has strengthened them spiritually and renewed their strength physically and sent them on. The publishing of the message of the Kingdom has reached a higher degree this year than any time heretofore. Books and booklets to the number of 102,792 have been placed in the hands of the people by members of God’s faithful remnant now operating in India. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The year just closed has marked another signal increase of activity and effective witnessing. For the first time in our history we have reached the six-figure mark in book output. A total of 102,792 books and booklets has been distributed, which is an increase of about thirty-four thousand on last year. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions have nearly doubled and, as may be expected, the howls of the shepherds of “Christendom'’ resulting from these “locust’’ stings are being heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our field covers the whole of India, Burma and Ceylon. It is a vast area. Much has been done, but much more remains to be done before it can be said that the message has been preached to every creature, even of the professed Christian communities. The entire field has been fairly generally covered, and, BO far as the European and Anglo-Indian communities are concerned, a very thorough witness has been given, but amongst the Indians there remains much pioneer work to be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The largest consolidated interest is in the state of Travan-core, in southern India, where three Indian pioneers and some 250 to 300 company workers are regularly in the witness field. Nearly half of the total output for the year has been placed by these workers. There is real, intelbgent grasp of the truth amongst them, and they are hfting high the standard of truth before their fellow countrymen. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is published monthly in their own language (Malayalam), and there are 392 subscribers. This has been the chief means whereby they are kept abreast of the revelation of truth. There is a cry to have this magazine published semimonthly, so as to keep up with the English edition, but the expense of such a limited demand prevents us from doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the north of India there is also a consolidated interest and activity among the Indian Christians. This is a comparatively new field, but progress is well maintained. Evidence of their zealous witnessing is found in the almost incessant tirade of abuse which is published in the vernacular press by the clergy and their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alli</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">es against these witnesses. These clergymen (Indian and American) seem to be unable to grasp the meaning of Jeremiah 25: 34-36 and to appreciate that the Lord foretold of them. It is Jehovah who is spoiling their pastures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In other parts of the field there is little consolidated activity or interest. In Burma there are small, zealous groups working systematically. In Bombay city we have a small company in regular service, but throughout the remainder of this vast field there are only isolated ones and twos sufficiently appreciative of the good news to take an active part in its proclamation. But the numbers are gradually increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The pioneers undoubtedly form the backbone of the general witness work. There are eight English and ten Indian pioneers in the field. We are using three house-cars, two of which are equipped with transcription machines, and one carries a cinema for the Photo-Drama work amongst the Indians. If only we had transcription machine records in the various Indian vernacular languages, there is no doubt a marvelous work could be accomplished. One pioneer (Anglo-Indian) was removed by death during the year, but the Lord raised up another to take his place. These 19 pioneers placed 62 percent of the total literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These campaigns rank most important of the year’s activities. Figures show that 28 percent of the total hours spent in the witness work during the whole year were spent during the forty-five days set aside as special testimony periods, while 21 percent of the total literature was then placed. The following table shows the summary of this activity as compared with the previous year’s.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When last year’s report was made we had only just received our first transcription machine. Now we have five electrical ones and three gramophones in service. The results obtained have been varied. Indoor meetings have been almost fruitless, but in this country of rainless months outdoor meetings are obviously ideal. The greatest obstacle is the language problem. The European is, on the whole, far too snobbish to identify himself with an open-air crowd, but the Indians will gather into a crowd anywhere and for any purpose. Indians will gather round and evince their curiosity by trying to climb into the horn of the loud-speaker, even though they cannot understand a word of what is being said; but out of the crowd there are always some who are more intelligent, and many a time have some of these come forward to find out more on the subject of the Kingdom. We are looking forward to the new smaller records for use on an ordinary gramophone. Where facilities for transportation are limited (and this is generally the case) the smaller outfit should be a real boon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is becoming more apparent that a great work is yet to be done among the Indians who cannot read English. They represent the masses of India, and especially the Christian community. Slowly but surely is this work progressing, and each year sees a few more Indians coming forward to take an active part in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom to their countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The provision of vernacular literature is one of our greatest problems. There is a great cry for much more than we print. It requires a considerable outlay of money, and there is little return for it, but progress is being made. The following booklets have been published during the year: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Tamil and Burmese; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Urdu and Tamil; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Is Godt</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Malayalam; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Malayalam, T</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, Urdu, and Karen (Burma) ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Malayalam. A tract on the “Trinity” was published also m Urdu. The new booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is now being translated and published in various vernaculars, as well as a Telugu and Kanarese edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And so another happy year of service has ended and we launch out into a new year, determined to press the battle to the gate towards the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that land of darkness is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and this instrument of Satan has its agencies in every part of the government, and particularly the “strong-arm squad”. The following is an excerpt from the Italian report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One pioneer who worked in the section which formerly belonged to Austria was finally stopped altogether. The police everywhere was hateful towards the message of truth. Some literature, however, is being sent to isolated brethren from time to time. A few brethren report how they suffer because they are not able to do more for the Italian people who appear to be hungry for the truth. The Lord knows why He permits these conditions, and the leaders of the Italian nation, who have been warned by God’s people, are only increasing the wrath of God's judgment upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Italy the distribution of books and booklets totaled only 747.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful remnant in Jamaica have been doing their best to publish the Kingdom message. During the fiscal year they have placed in the hands of the people 36,029 books and booklets, besides holding many meetings and thus by word of mouth publishing the Kingdom message. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is quite a joy to forward our annual report for 1934. First, we ascribe praise to God for his mercies and supervision of the work m Jamaica. Although conditions have forced many of the pioneers out of the field, still the work goes on. The Lord has opened a new feature of service by the use of the transcription machines, and as a result some 50 of the Jona-dabs have been rescued. The loud-speaker machine is heard at times two miles away, and the demand for these lectures has increased. The public is much awakened to the study of the Bible. The workers are growing more interested in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the poor condition of electricity we had to secure a Stilco plant to enable us to deliver the lectures in every town and village of the island. This incurs extra expense in having to travel with an electrician until we are able to carry it on ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We are permitted to deliver the lectures in a big race track in Kingston where thousands attend. We find that asking questions after each record is played awakens much interest at public meetings. This is another glorious feature of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> plays a wonderful part m causing all to see eye to eye. It checks disorders among the brethren by showing the right interpretation of certain questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has long been classed by the nations of “Christendom” as a heathen nation. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">heathen,</span><span class="font5"> however, would apply to “Christendom” about as well as it does to Japan. The Roman Catholic hierarchy there, now aided and abetted by Protestant clergymen who merely work for hire, have attempted to teach the Japanese, but have used religion more for commercial purposes than for any other, and religion has enabled them to establish missions there, by which they get the necessary material things for a living; but they not only have kept the Japanese in darkness but have prevented them from hearing the published message of the Kingdom. The misrepresentations by the clergy to the police officials of the land have brought many difficulties upon Jehovah’s witnesses in that country. The books and other literature have been seized and confiscated, many of the brethren arrested and thrown into prison, and now only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> can be published and distributed. The zeal of the Japanese brethren, however, has not been dampened by this persecution. The government refuses absolutely to permit the importation of any of the Society’s publications. Hence </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and books and booklets cannot be shipped into that country. The Japanese brethren are enabled by the grace of the Lord, however, to have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles in the Japanese language in their hands to enable them to keep abreast with the unfolding of God’s prophecies. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine is published in the Japanese language under the provisions of the newspaper law. Notwithstanding the opposition, this part of publishing the Kingdom message has gone forward during the year, and the circulation of that magazine totaled during the year to the number of 1,143,000. Each issue of the magazine carries the message of the Kingdom, the matter there published being taken from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and books and booklets of the Society. There are now 31,000 subscribers regularly on the list receiving the magazine, besides the numbers being placed in the hands of the people by the faithful remnant who go from place to place to publish the same. Before the publication of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine the name of Jehovah never was heard of in Japan, but now the people are quite familiar with the name Jehovah and his witnesses. Several Jonadabs have come forward and manifested not only their interest in God’s kingdom message, but their zeal in making it known to others. There are 65 regular workers in the field, the ages of these ranging from 14 to 73 years. These workers left their former positions and their relatives, and for the love of God and his kingdom, have gone forth in the work, and are doing with their might what their hands find to do. The zeal of these dear Japanese witnesses for Jehovah is remarkable in many respects. Surely God has marked them as his own, and they are specially privileged to serve him in that manner These witnesses travel on bicycles and carry with them tents in which they live. The roads are bad and the air is damp, especially during the rainy season, and thus it is observed that these witnesses of Jehovah work under great difficulties. As a sample of the difficulties under which these faithful publishers of the Kingdom message work in that land the following letter is published:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> : Greeting in the name of Jehovah and our Lord Jesus Chnst. I am so glad and thank God to hear the Victorious news to his holy name in Japan. Now we do work in the reflection of the present truth with such a great joy. Here is a good news that shows his gracious protection for his people. Yesterday I left my tent for Hommojin, a little village about 13 kilometers in distance, on the bicycle myself alone. All the road is covered with such thick forests and high grass hardly to pass. I had to cross the streams on foot. Surely it was the hardest pass I ever experienced. There are many poisonous vipers and wild bears in the mountains, and the people in the vicinity are very afraid to pass this road. But I was quite safe all the way through under His protection. Finally I reached Hommojiri and delivered the message of the Kingdom by placing many copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Then I left there for Nokanan, the next village located another 12 kilometers from Hommojin. I had to pass another bad mountain road. It is so narrow that I had to push my bicycle on foot. But, thank Ged, I could reach my destination safely at last. And I have found there some interesting things were waiting for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I have visited a Christian first as usual, and I have found that there is a Christian meeting being held at his home. I was invited to the meeting and I had a good opportunity to give a long testimony to the name of Jehovah God. Then a young man said to me, ‘ ‘ The other day when I visited Sapporo city [the capital city of Hokkaido], I bought some copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> from a lady. I have read them carefully and got such a great shock. I brought them with me here and showed them to my fellow Christians around here. Now a great question arose among us. ’ ’ Thus I was given a best opportunity to explain the truth to them. They have listened to me till the midnight. The next day I left them and returned to our tent where my partner (a young brother of 17 years old) was waiting for me. We thank God for the blessings bestowed on us and for his gracious provisions wherever we go. The grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all at the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the Society’s office 13 persons are employed to prepare the literature for distribution amongst the people. These spend a part of the time in the field in publishing the Kingdom message. While only a small number of workers operate in Japan, 195,518 people in the Japanese country have received the witness during the year. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are two regional service directors working in Japan. As I said above, we have no company in Japan. So the work of the regional service directors is something different from that in America and European countries. In Japan they go round to visit pioneers and others to find and exchange the better ways for the field service. During the last fiscal year they traveled 32,831 kilometers, had 109 meetings, with 1,469 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year the Society’s office at Tokyo received 5,263 mails and dispatched 8,341 mails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As to your advice, I wrote to Viscount Saito asking for an interview with me. He is the former premier and the man who is responsible for the great oppression upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan last year. My request is granted, and I called on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> at his home on September 6 last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I had a good opportunity to explain the Truth for one hour and fifteen minutes. We both had a Bible in hand, and he read the scriptures when I point them carefully. I told him about the reason why Armageddon comes, why the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nam</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e of Jehovah must be vindicated, how the Lord will bless mankind with life and happiness. He has hstened to my speech very carefully. After I finished he said: “I got the report concerning Jehovah’s witnesses last year at the cabinet meetings. The public press wrote much about your people. The police department did not report to me about particulars except the ‘facts’, so called. I was too busy to attend this case at that time. Now I hear your explanation about the things which written long years ago and the work which you are doing. I see that you have no intention to do anything with political affairs in Japan. I will take this matter to Mr. Karasawa, the general chief of police of Japan, and you better see him your* self. I an sure he will do something for you.” The interview is ended and he promised me that he shall meet with me again, and he showed me off at the porch, which is very unusual for the customs in Japan. I t</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hink</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> I will see the general chief in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in Korea is small, yet the gospel of the Kingdom is published. Nine pioneers and sixteen company workers have engaged in the publication of the message there. The placements amount to 34,283 booklets. The people of good will, otherwise known as “Jonadabs”, are awakening in that land, finding their only hope is the kingdom of God under Christ. And thus the gospel is being carried to the uttermost parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LATVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this little country on the Baltic sea the proclamation of the Kingdom message progressed for a time during the first part of the year and books and booklets to the number of 31,090 were placed in the hands of the people, which is a decided increase over the previous year; but the Devil, acting through his active agents, the clergy, who took advantage of disturbed political conditions, caused the books of the Society to be seized and the office closed. The following excerpts from the local manager’s report are here inserted, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The winter was a difficult one for the pioneers. The weather, instead of continuing cold with plenty of snow, alternated between frost and thaw. This condition made traveling in the country places most difficult, as, instead of the surface of the ground being hard, it had, more often than not, a covering of water over underlying ice. One pioneer, writing from a railway station where he had temporarily taken refuge, said that the view of the countryside was as of a great lake. These conditions were unusual for this country, and continued practically all winter. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the number of pioneers working throughout the year averaged 9 out of 10 whose names appear in the Society’s books, and the number of booklets spread by them, 21,498, represented an increase of more than 58 percent over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This forward movement was later to meet with something in the nature of a setback. In one way or another we are continually kept aware of the opposition of the clergy. In the month of December the Ecclesiastical Department of the Home Office took exception to a sentence in the Russian translation of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Final War,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which was issued about that time. When the matter'was brought before the court, however, judgment was given in our favor. There is little doubt that we should succeed in every similar case were the matters always brought to the court for judgment. The enemies of the truth, however, prefer other methods, less open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On May 16, following a coup d’etat during the night preceding, when all political opponents were arrested and imprisoned, martial law was proclaimed in all the country for six months. This gave our enemies the opportunity they needed for their iniquitous work, and they took advantage of the exceptional conditions prevailing at the time, to have the Latvian Society closed on the false ground that its activities were communistic. The announcement was made in the Government Gazette, dated 5th July, and liquidators were appointed at the same time, the chairman being a clergyman (the same individual who was mainly responsible for the action taken against the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Final War</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet, mentioned). Shortly thereafter the office books of the Society were removed, and later the liquidators took possession of some 45,000 booklets and Bibles, the property of the Latvian Society. From the date of the closure all sums due from the pioneers and companies must be paid to the liquidators, and it has been officially announced that all money thus received, with whatever is obtained from the sale of the stock of books taken, will be retained by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some surprise and many comments have been made owing to the closing of the Society. The people know that its teachings are not subversive, and they wonder. This has given many opportunities to explain the position and to expose the hypocrisy of the clergy and to show that the only hope for the world is the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the time of writing there is a reasonable hope that we may yet get going again; there are two alternative proposals under consideration. Looking to the Lord for help we hope that soon something will be accomplished in this direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For some time past </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has taught us to expect that the clergy and others would conspire in just this way m an effort to prevent the truth’s going to the people. We are not, therefore, surprised at what has taken place here; the clergy are clearly identifying themselves as the Lord’s enemies and associates of the Devil. The Lord will recompense them in his own time and way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the first booklet was printed in Latvia, in June, 1933, more </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">than</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 40,000 have been spread among the people, 31,090 coming within the present fiscal year. The work has been a joy and pleasure to everyone who has had a share in it, and the only thought of the anointed now is as to how soon it will be before we can recover the books and continue to witness to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our confidence is in Jehovah; our trust is in Him, and we look to him for help. We know that the day of battle </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> approaching; we can see the forces lining up for the conflict, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> rejoice that the Lord has given us some shaie in his work, which will culminate in the great battle of the Lord God Almighty, when, once and for ever, he will settle accounts with his enemies and vindicate his great name, that men may Imow that he, &quot;whose name alone is Jehovah,&quot; is the Most High over all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LITHUANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little strip of country along the Baltic sea formerly under the German rule, now known as Memelge-biet, a part of Lithuania, is where the work of publishing the Kingdom message has been carried on in that country during the last year. The conditions in the country are far worse than they were a year ago. Trade with Germany has practically ceased, and the exports to England have also been greatly restricted. The people generally have little or no money. Conditions are exceedingly bad. The distribution of the Kingdom message has been limited during the year to 7,978 books and booklets. Amongst other things, the local manager reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only financial conditions, but the political situation also, has made the work of witnessing in Memelgebiet very difficult. Many people, German at heart, are extreme ‘ ‘ Hitlerites ’ showing the same hatred of the truth as the Nazis m Germany, although as some are learning of the real conditions in Germany they are altering their attitude towards the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the past twelve months 10,382 pieces of literature have been spread in this district. This figure includes odd numbers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which journal has, in addition, 709 regular subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The clergy have been active, as usual, in causing legal action to be taken against Jehovah's witnesses. Adopting methods similar to those of their &quot;brethren&quot; in other lands, they get the police to jnake arrests and then seem to vanish from the picture. Three cases have been proceeded with, and each has been decided in our favor. One case was taken by us to the highest court, where it was proved that a false charge had been made, but as this last court did not wish to give a verdict against that of the lower court the matter was delayed so that, under the &quot;statute of limitations'’, it could be quietly dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One of Jehovah’s witnesses in another part of Lithuania was arrested for distributing our literature and was told by the police that he would surely get a twelve years’ sentence. The case was eventually dismissed, however, and the brother demanded the return of the literature which had been commandeered by the police and which, he pointed out, was not his property. After some trouble the literature was handed over on the promise that it would be given to the rightful owners. This promise was carried out, the brother contending that the rightful owners were the people of good will desiring to be informed concerning Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Apart from the friends in Memelgebiet, very few of those in Lithuania who have come to a knowledge of the truth seem to realize its purpose. Some of these have returned from America, and conversation with them soon discloses the feet that they have been &quot;nourished&quot; by &quot;elective elders&quot; and have little or no conception of the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are &quot;a people for a purpose&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LUXEMBURG</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A small territory is that of Luxemburg, controlled by politicians and the Catholic hierarchy. It is under the jurisdiction of the Central European office. During the year the brethren have put forth a strenuous effort there, and under very adverse conditions, to publish the message of the Kingdom. There have been only 15 workers in the field, and, by the Lord’s grace, they have placed books and booklets to the number of 3,164.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a Catholic country, and therefore action is greatly hindered and the brethren often are arrested, fined and thrown into prison. Nevertheless, they are very courageous and rejoice to have a share in every special campaign. Two auxiliary pioneers were active, but had to cease their work. The police searched for a German pioneer, but he could get across the boundary and continue working in another country. A regional service convention took place at Luxemburg, which was attended by 100 brethren and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MEXICO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries the Roman Catholic hierarchy absolutely dominated in Mexico. In more recent years the people have thrown off this shackle to a large degree; yet the subtle influence of these religionists is great. As Jehovah’s witnesses go forth to make publication of the Kingdom message, this enemy of dark hue, by subtle means, creates the impression amongst the official element that Jehovah’s witnesses are merely another religion, and thus brings persecution upon those who are faithful to the Lord. Regardless of these handicaps, the work in Mexico during the ensuing year has progressed. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people and bearing the Kingdom message is, to wit, 133,010. From the branch manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been a blessed year and the results have gone away beyond our expectations, but not beyond our desires and the needs of the country, for there is yet much work to be done, and, by the Lord’s grace, we will do it, no matter how hard Satan tries to hinder in all possible manner. The convention just had, practically at the close of the fiscal year, has proved a great stimulus to the friends, all of whom feel ready, with renewed zeal, to continue doing their part this new year, and to prove our confidence in the Lord’s blessings to our efforts this fiscal year we are increasing our booklet quota to 150,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Endeavoring to improve the previous year’s record, early in 1933-34 fiscal year we fixed the following quota: Workers, 150; testimonies, 360,000; hours worked, 48,000; obtainers, 40,000; books, 24,000; booklets, 60,000. The results are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Results, 1933-1034</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Average number of workers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(60 pioneers; 12 auxiliaries)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of testimonies given &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;517,115</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of hours worked &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,654</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of obtainers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96,014</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of books placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,123</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106,887</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of hterature placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133,010</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Really, the results are greater, but it is next to impossible to make some friends report regularly. We do not include in this list Bibles, neither free literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It can be noticed that all figures were left behind, except the one of workers expected to engage, though in one month we had as high as 171 giving the testimony. Though difficult to get the reporta on time, the friends are somewhat improving in this respect. It is worth while noticing that the entire reported output during the fiscal year reported is over 100 percent better than the previous year. The output reported for 1932-1933 was 53,444 pieces, and it was a record year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions, Radio, Transcriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We had two conventions this year, one in Veracruz, and the other in Mexico city. Both resulted in great encouragement and in record-breaking placements and testimonies given. At the last convention we had 75 workers, who in five mornings placed 3,000 booklets. We were sorry not to have some brethren from the States to encourage the friends as in 1932 convention, but, notwithstanding, there was a great joy for all and everything worked together for good and to the glory of Jehovah. By means of committees all the different activities were earned on smoothly. The spirit of cooperation was noticeable and commented upon. At the meetings, mostly late articles of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were discussed. At both conventions resolutions were passed to the effect of pledging once more full cooperation with the visible organization to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A great deal of difficulty has attended the radio question, but, in spite of all, we have used radio constantly this fiscal year, and at present we are broadcasting every day, using a small station (XECW). The total of radio hours was 124. Five stations were used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The transcription machines offer good opportunities, but the only difficulty is the question of transportation. We have kept two of them busy, and expect to put two more to work. We were expecting to have one machine going constantly. The approximate number of times the machines were used during the last six months was 93, and the attendance about 2,607. One of the experiences had by the brethren in charge of one of the transcription machines was his arrest, together with two other brethren, charged with violating the religious laws of Mexico. All night they were under arrest, but sleeping soundly, trusting in the Lord and glad that some cents were saved for lodging. A few records were put on the next day before the authorities, and, after proving that this was no &quot;religion”, the charges were dismissed. That night, after returning from work at a near-by town, they were sent word by what we may call the &quot;mayor” encouraging them to put on some records, as the message was important for the people to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s Northern European branch office maintained at Copenhagen exercises immediate supervision over the publication of the Kingdom message in the following countries, to wit: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden. From this office is given the total distribution of books and booklets throughout the above territory, but these figures are not to be considered in reaching the grand total, since they are also set forth in the respective countries above named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That God’s people may get a general view of the work carried on in the jurisdiction above mentioned, the following extracts are here set out from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the year just ended there has been a greater measure of peace from the outside allowed us by the authorities in the four old countries. True, in Denmark two pioneers were put in prison for a couple of nights at the instance of the clergy, but the police were very kind as they performed, to them, an unpleasant duty. Thereafter we took immediate action by supplying every worker with identity certificates signed and sealed by the Society. These stated in unequivocal terms that our brethren were voluntary colaborers, earning nothing at all, and that by the judgment of the Danish Supreme Court they had full and perfect liberty to do this work both on weekdays and on Sundays. On several occasions afterwards our workers were stopped by the police, but when they read the certificates courteous apology was made and they were allowed to carry on. In Norway the cases against us were settled out of court, as reported to you, and the work there also goes forward without let or hindrance. Only in the Baltic States is there trouble, for in each there is a dictator, and these men are frightened to death of communism, so that when the clergy make false charges the authorities act. In Estonia, purely as a result of clerical action, we were shut off the air, for the station now belongs to the government; in Latvia our Latvian Society, which we had such difficulty in getting registered, was closed and our stock of books as well as our cash (5 cents!) was confiscated. Think of a clergyman’s being appointed liquidator! It was indeed galling, and one can picture Gog enjoying it; but they laugh best who laugh last. In Lithuania we are now registered and hope to get more water on the wheel shortly. It is the only country which shows a decrease, for all others, including Latvia, went forward with a swing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1033-34 has indeed been a wonderful year, in that in Northern Europe we had no less than four records to our credit. They occurred in the four chief testimony periods. The first was in October, The Kingdom Proclamation Period. Then we had the record number of 1,809 brethren out, and these used 21,679 hours, gave 136,785 testimonies, and placed 124,319 pieces of literature. Followed “Dividing the People” Period, in January, when 2,071 were out and placed 140,769. Two records I Soon, however, came a third, when, in the March Thanksgiving Period, 2,428 went out, used 30,112 hours, gave 233,453 testimonies, and placed 201,082 pieces of literature. Even a one-time Scot could not refrain from a cable after that! Where did these extra 619 brethren over our October record come fromf Surely many, if not most of them, were the ‘millions now living who will never die’, or Jonadab class. In that one period we spread as many as Northern Europe used to do m a year. Then came “The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period, and even in the warm month of July we beat our two earlier records of October and January, though it did not come up to the March effort. We had 2,102 out, used 27,407 hours, gave 202,014 testimonies, and spread 173,719. In other words, in four nine-day periods we spread 639,889.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year our testimonies jumped from 1,853,292 last year to 2,296,745, our hours went up to 463,016, and the weekly number out went from 1,086 to 1,133. There were placed 87,232 books and 1,322,594 booklets; a grand total of 1,409,826. We are down on books by 16,583, but up on booklets by 444,414. Naturally we should have liked to have more bound books too, but when so many booklet campaigns were had we were glad to be with our brethren everywhere in delivering these pointed and timely messages to the people, realizing it was Jehovah’s due time for them to go out. Our mark was set at 1,200 out each week, and we managed 1,133, at 2,250,000 testimonies and reached 2,296,745, at 500,000 hours, and we managed 463,016. It pays well to aim high enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the four old countries the regional service directors have done good work, and in Norway, where there is only one, three journeys have been made by Swedish ones to good advantage. Now, additionally, there come many inquiries as to meetings for the Jonadab friends, who are springing up all over, so there is still more work for them, unless possibly we can secure good records in the Northern languages at moderate rates. English-speaking countries are richly blessed in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The ranks of our pioneers and auxiliaries were increased by 29, for there were 242 out each week, on average; and these placed 598,716, as against 445,614 last year. In Norway, Finland and part of Sweden the ways are long and the houses few and far between, but many hardships and difficulties are cheerfully endured that the Kingdom fruits may be borne forth to others. One brother in Norway goes on a cycle in summer, with a tent and books on the carrier, and on one occasion as he lay in his tent he was stoned by a band of hoohgans. However, he was not harmed. In winter he goes on skis. Two 1'innish sisters are helping in Estonia, where accommodation in the country is very poor, and one of them was in hospital several weeks with typhus fever; but still they go on. Just as the Devil’s crowd pushed us </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oft</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the radio in Estonia, an English pioneer was able to go around giving lectures m Estonian; so as one method is closed to us another opens up and the message goes out. Another young English pioneer has also done very well there and is spreading many books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On the northwestern coast of Norway the motorboat “Ester” continues with her crew of two to give a good account of herself. Close on 10,000 pieces were spread in what is practically virgin territory, an increase of over 40 percent on last year’s results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> based upon the American ones, go out regularly in all countries, and so the work goes forward in a uniform manner everywhere. They are the field orders of the Lord’s army this side the veil Those who most closely follow the directions achieve the best results. In every country the testimony cards are used, and these keep the presentation of the message uniform and at the same time conserve the strength of the workers, a very important consideration. True it is that when a district has been covered several times, many people, when they see the card, refuse to look at it at all, but, so far, at all events, the balance is on the right side. That the Devil’s organization sometimes copies our method says a deal for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> last year reached 53,000 subscriptions, apart from copies spread singly, but if we take into account that in Finland we now have edition A on the first of the month and edition B on the 15th, we have virtually an increase of 8,500. The B edition was begun only this year. We appreciate very much the matter in the mother paper which is suitable for our issues, even though most articles must be cut down, because three of our four editions are 16-page ones. That article on ‘ ‘ Persecution in Germany ’ ’ was, for example, very useful for us, and our July edition, which contained a five-page cut-down, was printed on 174,000 copies. Without doubt that will have opened the eyes of all right-t</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hinking</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> people, who read the article, to the inherent rottenness of Nazism, which is of the Devil, devilish. In the larger towns, when invitations are sent out to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> readers to attend a senes of lectures, the result is always that some of the Jonadab class get np into the chanot. It is thus a very effective Kingdom agent, and its visits are a constant reminder to the people of those things which shall shortly come to pass. Time and again it has been instrumental in placing sets of the books, so that work with the magazine also helps forward the spread of the books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Borne companies the Devil has sought to cause trouble through &quot;elective elders&quot; who talk about the &quot;God-given rights of the church&quot; and of the &quot;right of the church to determine its own matters&quot;. That means, of course, that such &quot;elective elders&quot; want matters to go after their wishes. In the final analysis, these brethren suffer from an overweening sense of their own importance. They live away back 'in the good old days' of Brother Russell and are selfishness epitomized. Instead of serving Jehovah according to the organization method, they serve their own bellies. They refuse instruction and, like certain ones of old, are 'willingly ignorant’ concerning God’s Word. And yet, Brother Rutherford, how they could help themselves by reading and assimilating that fine article on &quot;His Organization&quot;, in the December 1 (1933) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> At bottom, the troubles that so arise are really traceable to this: that many who should know better do not clearly discern the two organizations and do not appreciate the fact that Chnst is at the temple for judgment and is judging his people now. Bo far I am glad to say the work is not affected, uiough that is, of course, the Deni’s objective. However, we know that no opposition whatsoever can interfere with the accomplishment of Jehovah’s purposes. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hm</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> chariot goes grandly forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Norway, by the Lord’s grace, has progressed during the fiscal year, the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">gdom message being published in books and booklets to the number of 282,623. A country where the workers must proceed under difficulties, Jehovah’s witnesses gave a good account of themselves in the year that has just closed. The local manager, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Also this year has been wonderful We appreciate the great privilege to work in Jehovah's organization and to vindicate his name. We thank Jehovah for giving us more and more light. The articles in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have been wonderful It was a great joy to understand &quot;the ten plagues&quot; in the article &quot;His Name&quot;, &quot;His Covenants,” and &quot;Laborers’ Wages”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Books Two and Three of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preservation now </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at hand. We have especially been longing for the two </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> books to understand the glorious light therein, and we are thankful for getting the books in our language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Norway the situation has been just about the same as last year: a hard economic pressure and the same difficulties as over the whole earth. Satan and his agents have done their best to disturb the active fnends, but has not succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Also in Norway we begin to see the Jonadab class. They participate with joy in the witness work. This encourages Jehovah’s witnesses to go on, as also the result shows: 78 percent more literature sent out than last year, in spite of the long ways in the fjords and over the high mountains in the cold and stormy winters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In all, we have sent 282,623 books and booklets. It is 137,917 more than last year. Not so many books as last year, but if we are counting 6 booklets as one book, it still will be 112,891 more than last year. We have sent out 2,465 circulars and letters, 5,460 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletins.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Twelve companies are organized for service, and 207 friends participated in the witness work; 50 more than last year. Average number each week, 108. Twenty-eight pioneers and auxiliaries have been out, 8 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has 4,847 subscribers; 19,870 copies distributed; of these, 12,000 of the protest against Hitler’s persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. The magazine is still going forward, doing very good work, breaking the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The motorboat “Ester” has still only two brethren. It seems best not to be more, on account of the field. They are now m north Norway. The people there are more friendly, but many of them very poor. Last winter “Ester” was on the west coast and worked on the islands and in the fjords, where the people are very clergy-ridden, in great darkness. The intolerant ‘ ‘ dark men ’' sent the police after the brethren four or five times, and they had to move from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The largest companies are very often, on Sundays, driving in buses and motor lorries to different places about 30-60 miles away It is a great joy to partake in such attacks against Satan’s barricades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our year convention was a great feast. We had two days in the field. 176 friends went out, giving 3,707 testimonies, distributing 136 books and 2,199 booklets; total, 2,335. The friends came from nearly all parts of the country; not so many as last year from Bergen, as a convention would be there a fortnight later for the friends on the west coast, who could not afford the expensive journey to Oslo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not much has been done during the year in Palestine. This is not contrary to expectations. Few people within the limits of that country seem to have any interest in God’s kingdom. There are too many religionists there, however, the witness has been given during the year, and the Kingdom message published to the number of 737 books and booklets placed in the hands of the people. The Devil has builded his organization strong in that land, where once the Lord trod, but in due time the Lord will clear out the wicked organization completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publication of the Kingdom message continues throughout the Philippine Islands, being directed from the Society’s branch office at Manila. During the fiscal year books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people in the Philippines to the number of 23,405. More literature is being printed in the dialect of the natives, and the distribution has taken on a wider scope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries the Catholic element has dominated Poland commercially, politically and religiously. They have concluded that they own the country and the people. Claiming to represent God, they always have been actively representing the Devil. They have never let up in their persecution of God’s faithful witnesses in that land. These faithful ones, however, have not been deterred in their efforts to publish the message of the Kingdom, but have, under adverse conditions, gone forward in the work. During the year books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people to the number of 268,296. The local manager reports some interesting facts, which are set out as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During recent years the number of participants in the Memorial continually increased, so that m 1933 3,076 participated in the Memorial. This year we drew the attention of the brethren in no uncertain way to the fact that only those who have sworn to be faithful to the Lord in his vineyard have the right to partake of the Memorial emblems. As a result, only 2,519 brethren came to the Memorial. At the same time the brethren all over the country manifested a greater aeaL Thus, during the spring service campaign, 40 percent of the brethren engaged in the work, while last year the percentage had been 21 percent only. In the previous year the highest number of workers was 700. This year on certain occasions more than 1/100 workers stood in the field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We were very pleased to see the great importance of the Service Periods for the people of the Lord. Not only are they important because they bring greater joy to God's people, but also because the result of the months in which there has been a service period was double that of other months. Thus the months in which there is no special campaign are lean months, in which Jehovah’s witnesses have less joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As regards the light against the enemy organization, the persecutions on the part of the clergy have grown much more senous. They are now resorting to all the cunning means they can find to use agamst us, and, see</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> that they have been beaten everywhere, they have now completely ceased to fight with the sword of the spirit and have taken the literal sword into their hands. Thus we see the clergy raving in despair and resorting to their last dreadful means in inciting the people to attack the Lord’s people. Therefore the cases are increasing where brethren are maltreated by the clergy and their hordes. It even happens that the brethren are stopped from meeting together, so as to discourage them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">However, the brethren are not in the least intimidated by these furious attacks on the part of the clergy, and in the very places where the opposition is greatest it is noticed that thereupon the zeal of the brethren increases much. Thus we see that the Lord particularly blesses the faithful ones. We can see, too, how the people divide themselves into two classes, exactly as Brother Rutherford shows in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is interesting to note that sometimes even men holding higher positions in the government, when given an explanation of the truth, accept it. Thus we were thrilled when, for instance, the state attorney of the court of appeal of Thorn not only demanded the acquittal of a brother, against whom the clergy had brought a charge of blasphemy against God in distributing our Biblical literature, but stated that the witnesses of Jehovah of our time take exactly the same stand as did the first Christians: Misrepresented and persecuted, they stand for the highest ideals in a corrupt and falling world organization. The brother was, of course, acquitted. The state attorney of the court of appeal of Posen, as well, did not prosecute a brother, in spite of the fact that the accusation charged him with calling the Roman clergy “Satan’s organization’' The state attorney m his speech referred, among other things, to the papal court of Alexander VI with his debauched sons and daughters whence a dreadful immorality spread throughout “Christendom’’ where truly the spirit of a Satanic organization was manifest. He then compared this corruption and immorality with the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses about whom nothing can be said except that, faithful to their ideals, they put forth their best efforts to serve Jehovah. It is pleasing to see how such people are able to reach proper conclusions regarding the truth of the Bible and the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Such things cause the clergy class to rage, seeing that neither through the government nor through the courts can they accomplish that which they intend to do, namely, shut the mouths of Jehovah’s witnesses and stop them. That the brethren may be discouraged they resort to acts of violence against them, but in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is also very interesting to note that those who slander and attack the truth and the witnesses thereof flee when they are called npon to account for their action. Thus a certain Dr. Skrudlik wrote several booklets against Jehovah’s witnesses, denouncing them as communists, bolshevists and antichrist. When we took legal action against this “doctor of medicine</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bud philosophy’*, he became very ill and asked the court to postpone the case. He repeated this demand a second, and a third time, and it is said that because of serious illness he is not able to appear in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who oppose and persecute the Lord's people will not succeed. Thus there was a certain judge who held several brothers in prison without any reason or excuse, and he assured these that he would not rest until he would have destroyed Jehovah's witnesses in Poland. Two years ago, or even one year ago, this man believed he was near his goal This year, however, he is no more among the living, while Jehovah's witnesses are more active than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RUMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is another country wherein the religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic force, predominate. Several years ago the “man of sin” class, acting as the Devil’s special representative, temporarily wrecked the work in Rumania, and it has been under difficult conditions that it has been revived The brethren have during the year attempted to go on with the witness work. The enemy has caused the arrest and prosecution of 107 of the brethren. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of the judges seem to have a better sense of justice than in other countries, for all these prosecutions against us were eventually discontinued. In many cases the judges disagreed among themselves, some being opposed to the truth, ■while others took their stand on Jehovah’s side and in favor of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The rather great distances and the relatively bad means of communication in this country made it difficult to create an organization functioning satisfactorily. Then, too, most of the brethren are very poor materially and some of them are still illiterate. However, from the office we did what we could, and the Lord has blessed our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There were 12,649 more hours spent in the service, and in the distribution of books and booklets there is an increase of 43,156 copies. On an average there were 613 company workers and 6 pioneers, and these placed, in 43,079 hours, 113,594 books and booklets. In addition, 375 Bibles and “Testaments” were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rumania has a total of 113,594 books and booklets. The zealous faithful ones in Rumania are still pushing forward and joyfully proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. The Lord will have his witnesses in every place according to his will, and notice shall be served upon the people, that those of good will may have an opportunity to now take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SAAR BASIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Saar Basin is another territory put in the patch work map of Europe since the World War. It lies immediately between France and Germany, and has a population of approximately 800,000 persons, the majority of whom are Catholics. The Hierarchy controls them, but there are some good, honest Catholics amongst them who desire to know the truth. It is under the protectorate of the League of Nations; therefore under the direct control of the “image of the beast”. In spite of this darkness and great opposition from the enemy, Jehovah’s witnesses have joyfully gone into the fight and published the message of God’s kingdom. There are only four companies of consecrated ones in the Saar Basin, aggregating 189 persons Of these, 137 participated in the service, and were joined by 48 Jonadabs. During the year they placed books and booklets to the number of, to wit, 42,868. In addition thereto, Bibles to the number of 38 were placed in the hands of the people, and subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> taken to the number of 111. The work has recently begun in that country, and it is progressing. The following facts from the local manager’s report will be read with interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Although the government has granted the liberty to work on Sundays as well, the enemy has now for some time been putting forth his greatest efforts with a view to making this impossible. In fact, during recent months we have met with a special opposition on the part of the police, when working on Sundays, and this is due to the influence of the clergy. Thus one sister was prosecuted because of “disturbing the Sunday rest”. In spite of the fact that the attention of the court was drawn to a circular letter issued by the government, whereby the police were instructed not to interfere with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, the sister was fined. It is, however, encouraging to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> that the brethren know their divine commission and go forward fearlessly in spite of the many difficulties which they encounter. We may say that the zeal and the energy of the brethren have increased in the same proportion as the difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here there are also quite a number of Jonadabs who attend our meetings and participate regularly in the service from house to house. One often admires the firmness with which they defend the cause of the Lord although it is only recently that they have come in contact with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Service Periods have witnessed a steadily increasing number of workers, which proves that these special periods of witnessing are </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> great incentive for the brethren. These were times of joy, unity and gratitude towards Jehovah. In spite of many difficulties, the brethren took part in these special campaigns with great energy, and the results were accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The testimony cards which have recently been introduced in the service work have proved very advantageous, especially because the people have now taken a firm stand either for or against the truth. By this means a brief and uniform testimony is given and the people quickly decide whether they want to have something or not. We were thus enabled to reach more people during a given period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We are much pleased that, with the beginning of the new year, we may start the work with the electrical transcription machines, and we thank the Lord for thus opening up for us new opportunities of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God continues to show his loving-kindness to Spain, which has long been priest-ridden but is now emerging from the darkness. During the past year the output of the literature giving expression to God’s purpose almost doubles that of the previous year. The workers are small in number, but zealous in the Lord. Reporting on conditions, the local manager at Madrid says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During this report year the amount of literature placed in the hands of the people has been 2,813 books and 81,906 booklets, making a total of 84,719, as against 43,003 during the previous year and 12,713 in the year prior thereto. As before, the increase has been chiefly in the booklets, but it is very evident that the message in this form is doing a great work, as is seen from correspondence which comes in to this office. Only a few months ago a fnar wrote to us as follows: * ‘ I would very much like to free myself from the situation in which I find myself ... I am obliged to continue in this prison . . . I am one of the many prisoners who, as Judge Rutherford so well points out, still find themselves m ‘Christendom’, and I am trusting in the mercy of the Lord to grant me my liberty in order to become a real witness of Jehovah.” He has obtained all our literature and is a subscriber for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe he will become a ' ‘ Jonadab ’ ’, if not a Jw, one of these days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are few service workers in Spain, but the zeal and faithfulness of those who have risen to their privilege has been a constant joy and encouragement. Necessarily, the bulk of the witnessing is done by the pioneers. Only one of these is a Spaniard; and m spite of the difficulty of working in a foreign country, these have all been able to get along well with the aid of the printed testimony card. In fact, they do even better than such of us as can speak the language. The highest report received from any pioneer was for 1,003 booklets and 259 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> placed m 88} hours' work during a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the moment of writing this, Spain is once again in the throes of a revolutionary general strike. Nevertheless, a young German sister, who had arrived only a day earlier, and without any knowledge of the language, started out on the first day of the strike for her first time in the pioneer work and placed 1 book, 49 booklets, and 10 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in eight hours. One can truly say, ‘‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings . . . , ” for the message is the Lord’s and it is His doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When, in the early part of the year, some pioneers were forced to leave France and came here, this suddenly doubled our force, bringing up the number to twelve, and, consequently, we have had difficulty in keeping up with the demand for literature. We have also received numerous further applications from brethren desirous of pioneering in Spain, and we are doing everything possible to accommodate a good number </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">them as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In conclusion, I would like to add a word of appreciation and gratitude to Jehovah for the privilege of attending the London convention. I am quite confident in saying that never before have I derived so much benefit from a convention as this time. Once upon a time we used to return from a convention with some ‘‘beautiful thoughts”, but now the Lord’s people gather for the purpose of equipping themselves for the battle; to receive instructions from Jehovah's visible organization. It is so clear now that the Lord is in his temple, and we can see the Kingdom principles being applied with ever greater force. I am more convinced than ever that a recognition of the Lord's organization, which implies absolute obedience, loyalty and love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness, hence the complete elimination of self and of personalities, together with a determination to do the Lord’s will and be pleasing to him notwithstanding what others may Bay or think, is of paramount importance now. I do not think I have ever felt the Lord’s interest and intervention in our affairs as clearly as at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I have often refrained from expressing my great appreciation of you, because it might appear like flattery. On the one hand, you would not wish that; and on the other, I will not curry favor from any man in order to serve Jehovah. But I do want to tell you how much I love you because of the way in which you are so faithfully serving the Lord, and that every time I see you and the better I get to know you, the more I love you. It is so downright wicked of some to be slandering you and thus upsetting some of the brethren. Your own example and that of those who surround you are the greatest stimulus I have received at this convention to press on and serve the Lord with all my might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has blessed his people in Sweden during the fiscal year. There has been a decided increase in the proclamation of the message. Books and booklets to the number of 458,893 have been placed in the hands of the people. The brethren at the Bethel headquarters and office have been manifesting great zeal and activity in the work during the year. The report from the local headquarters, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The most encouraging feature to my mind is the fact that the Lord is now fulfilling his prophecies about a class of men of good will coming to know the truth and taking their stand upon the side of Jehovah and taking part in testifying to his name and kingdom. This &quot;Jonadab class&quot; is being manifest in our country now in a way we could not think of only a year ago. The numbers of workers reporting during the international Service Periods clearly establish this fact: In the October (1933) Kingdom Period, 521; in the &quot;Dividing the People&quot; Period, January, 1934, the number was 740; and &quot;Thanksgiving Period”, March, 1934, we reached a peak, 915 workers. Then, in the July &quot;Nations’ Hope” Period, it is true that the figure dropped to 735, but this corresponds to the number of 574 during the July Period in 1933, and never before 1934 have we had more than €25. The zeal of the Jonadab friends, and their joy, is a real encouragement, and some who claim to be of the witness company would do well to copy the seal these are manifesting. There are even whole-time workers among this Jonadab class. The fact that the number of subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has increased from 1,600 to 1,808 (by far the biggest increase we have ever had for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower')</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> also shows that the presentations of the truth given therein are being appreciated by the Jonadab fnends. And we have had to increase our editions of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> by nearly 100 percent lately. As a result of this increased number of workers wa have been able to testify to 698,335 people, as against 546,764 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Consequently the number of books, etc., placed with the people has also greatly increased The afoi ementioned periods, and the many new special booklets, have, of course, contributed very largely to this result. The total number of books and booklets placed with the people is 458,893, an increase above last year’s total of 150,659. There is a drop in bound books, from 41,052 to 37,466, owing partly to the poverty among those who want to look further into these truths, and partly to the fact that more time lias had to be devoted to putting out the various campaign features. But this is the only drop; all the rest of our figures are up, in every department. More companies are organized for service, more workers out regularly week by week, more hours spent in the work, more pioneers, more auxiliaries, more meetings, bigger attendance, etc., and the prospects are for continued increases all along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our pioneers have reached an average of 49, which is just the number of companies organized for service, by the way, and they have placed 192,379 books and booklets, whereas last year an average of 44 placed 141,966. Some of them have been working along the mountain ranges in the North, making their way on foot, many times long, long distances with no roads, sometimes rowing on the lakes, in fact the only way to get to some remote villages which are perfectly isolated when there is no open water or the ice is not strong enough to carry a man. They have also been calling upon business people in the towns, and many encouraging experiences have been had during this feature of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In my last annual report I mentioned that we were asking the friends to cooperate in an effort to reach some outlying parts, etc., where the message had not been previously preached by word of mouth, and this has been done to a notable degree. There have been 369 public meetings held, with an attendance of 31,064, against 265 and 22,057, respectively, last year. Our regional service directors have also had many encouraging experiences, when they have been sent to call upon isolated individuals or groups of persons who have been writing to the office for literature, and very often such a call has resulted in a small Jonadab company’s springing np and starting to tell other people about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> magazine also plows the ground and prepares the minds of these Jonadabs. In the companies the method has often been used, and with great success, that an invitation is Bent from the office to all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscribers within a territory of a company to come to a meeting specially arranged for them during the visit of the regional service director brother. Thereafter the interested ones of those turning up have been invited to the regular meetings of the company, and quite a few have found their way to the studies and become regular workers. A goodly number of these people have also symbolized their consecration to do the will of Jehovah. Of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> there have been spread among the pubbc, besides the books and booklets, a number of 80,283 loose copies, and the number of subscribers is now 23,076. Last year we had 22,179 subscribers, and spread 61,379 loose copies. An especially interesting item in connection with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">work was the week in August, when we specialized on the issue carrying the report about the persecutions in Germany. Of this issue alone, there were placed with the public during that one week more than 15,900 copies (and there had been many placed before), and 488 subscriptions were taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There would be many more interesting and encouraging items to dwell upon, but time fails me. We are looking forward now with great expectations to the Kingdom Period, starting the new fiscal year; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> it not as it should be, that when we look back upon what we have done, by the Lord’s grace, or rather, upon what it has pleased Him to do through us, then we can look forward again with restrengthened faith and renewed courage and so go on to the next fight in this wonderful campaign under the great and mighty Warrior, the Prince of Peace I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This is the happy privilege of the friends in Sweden, and I rejoice to say that, with so few exceptions that they are only serving to establish the rule, the friends here are m a good spiritual condition and rejoicing in their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In closing, permit me to voice our thankfulness for all the rich spiritual food it has pleased the Lord to spread on our table and through the service of you as His faithful servant, entrusted with the work of putting into writing what He now wants us to feed upon. To </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> be all the glory and honor, and when we thank you we are only gratefully acknowledging his arrangement. May Jehovah himself and our Lord and King, Christ Jesus, continue to bless and keep and guide you and use you to the vindication of his holy name; and may we all be found faithful, fighting with you in his army, is my constant prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As one views the earth in the present conditions it is more strongly impressed upon the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">d that Satan, the prince of darkness, is the god of this world, who blinds the minds of the people lest the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is Jehovah’s chief witness, should shine into their hearts. Switzerland is a beautifully situated country, and its people are quite liberal with reference to almost everything. There is a strong Catholic influence in many parts of Switzerland, however. The country is divided into 22 different counties, or cantons, and some of these cantons are almost exclusively Catholic, and there these religionists exercise a cruel influence and have the strong-arm squad carry out their wicked purpose. The people of Switzerland make much over the fact that William Tell struck a great blow for liberty, but Satan and his wicked machinations soon drew the people into an even worse net, and it would take much more than a William Tell to strike off the shackles of the Swiss people, as well as in other parts of the earth. Christ Jesus, the great Executive Officer of Jehovah, will do this work and do it completely, at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Central European office is situated in Berne, Switzerland, and from there is conducted the work in many parts of central and southern Europe. The brethren who operate the office and factory are earnest and zealous and have greatly enjoyed the Lord’s blessing during the past year. In addition to manufacturing books, booklets, and magazines, there have been made at this office also transcription machines and phonographs, as well as the discs or records therefor. These are made in the German language and are used throughout the land of Switzerland and some other parts of the country. There are many honest and sincere people in the land of Switzerland, a goodly number of whom are taking their stand on the side of the Lord and his kingdom and thus seeking a place of refuge during the great storm that is rapidly approaching. From the report of the manager at Berne the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A member of the Berne office used his vacation to offer booklets to a few residents of the beautifully situated town of Seelisberg, on the lake of Lucerne. Immediately he was stopped by the local policeman, who arrested him and took </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the chief town of the canton. Without according him any trial he was taken to a dirty prison cell. With scanty food he was kept there a day and a night. In the evening there was a festival in that town and the brother heard in his cell some speaker proclaiming the wonderful freedom in the land of Tell. The next day, without giving him any hearing, he was taken to the place where he was born, and there they expected to take him to the poorhouse. Finally the case was examined and the canton which claims to be the cradle of free Switzerland was thus dishonored. The father of this brother, who is a locomotive engineer, as well as the brother himself have made a complaint, which is now in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Several Swiss courts have rendered some very unjust judgments recently, and they are seeking more and more to represent our activity as commercial peddling. The brethren, however, have refused to pay fines and have preferred to go to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One brother, who spent a few days in jail at Berne, was in the same cell with three Chinamen. The prison keeper brought a book with pictures in an unknown language and thought that they might look at that for their entertainment. It appeared that this book, which is in the prison library, was the illustrated “Creation Drama” book in the Arabian language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It really appears as though the authorities have given order to watch our activity more closely. The expression is often heard: “The activity of the Bible Students, Jehovah’s witnesses, must be stopped.' ’ God’s people in Switzerland are determined to obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we had 51 lawsuits, two-thirds of which wore settled m our favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the larger part of Switzerland, during the year, a wonderful witness was given. This small country counts 47 organized companies with an average of 800 company workers. During Thanksgiving Period 975 brethren engaged in the service. There is everywhere complete harmony, and thus with the Lord’s blessing the following result was obtained: 65,374 hours (an increase above last year of 5,872 hours), 20,807 books (an increase of 555), 258,309 booklets (an increase of 3,582), 164,602 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies (an increase of 50,381), and 2,026 new </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> readers. This added to what was distributed by others makes a total of 311,968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the winter the “Creation Drama” pictures were shown fifteen times. The meetings were well attended, particularly in Geneva, Lausanne, and Vevey. Follow-up meetings were held and great interest was shown. Quite a few Jonadabs have entered the chariot since this action with the Creation Drama pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All together, 107 public meetings were held, with an attendance of 22,567. Six regional service conventions took place, with an attendance of 1,800 brethren. Two regional service directors were sent out from this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The c</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ax of the year was the Basel convention and Brother Rutherford’s visit in Switzerland. The time was </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ited, and yet the Basel convention v. as, without doubt, the largest and most blessed convention ever held in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Friday noon 1,500 brethren were present, and the number increased until, on Sunday, nearly 3,000 friends were present. They had come from many European countries, namely, from Austria, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Poland, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain, and from Canada and the United States. Particularly for the German and Austrian friends, it was a sacrifice to come. Some were refused passports and yet they crossed the line; some traveled for days on bicycles, some by car, autobus and railway, and still others walked long distances in order to be at this eventful meeting of God’s people. About 1,000 brethren from Germany were present, and they received a great encouragement and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford spoke on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> article “Fear Them Not”, and a large banner with this same text was stretched across the platform. This banner was prepared long before we knew that Brother Rutherford would use this very subject. With tears of joy in their eyes the brethren responded to the words of comfort and said: “Yes, by His grace, we want to be faithful, come what may.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bethel family consists now of 70 members. All took a part in the service itr their spare time and accomplished the following: 6,697 hours, 3,930 books, 25,327 booklets, 19,398 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> copies and 75 subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aside from the influence exercised by the clergy in Switzerland, doubtless many persons express themselves on the side of the Lord, seeing that the day is not far distant when the influence of the clergy will be broken and those who are held in prison will find their great privilege of devoting themselves wholly to God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message of God’s kingdom is published to an extent in Syria. The report from that land, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With thankful heart, I wish to inform you about what little privileges of service I performed during this year in honoring Jehovah’s name, beginning October 1, 1933, to September 11, 1934, and I hasten to offer you this a</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nnual</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> report for its arrival at the beginning of next October.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark37"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of pioneers</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of testimonies given &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,365</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark44"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total number of booklets placed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark45"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Total literature placed</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These books and booklets are placed mostly among the Armenians. But partly some of them are placed among the Christian and Mahometan Arabs and Jews, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In this opportunity I notify in behalf of the Lord’s soldiers of Syria our thankfulness to the Watch Tower Society and you personally. And I pray that the Lord bless you and strengthen you, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> that you may be able to give ns the contemporary food more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Port of Spain, Trinidad, the work is directed in Trinidad, Tobago, St. Vincent, Grenada, Barbados, and Antigua. The work has gone on during the year, and there has been a slight increase, notwithstanding the difficulties and opposition that have been met there. The clergy especially put forth their best endeavor to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. During the year the output of books and booklets totaled the sum of, to wit, 45,611. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There has been more open opposition than for some years, and this more particularly in portions of the territory where previously there had not been much activity. A brother and two sisters went to the island of Antigua, and the clergy there not only have warned the people against them from their pul-*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">£</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">its, but have also entered the homes of some, strictly profiting their reading the literature, and destroying it. They have further disturbed meetings which were in progress, to the indignation of the public present and enjoying the lectures being delivered, in one case resulting in a more favorable place being offered for the lecture. In the island of Grenada, a clergyman in his opposition went so far as to say that Jehovah is a murderous and bloodthirsty God of the Jews, not the Father of Jesus Chnst, that the “Old Testament” is not authentic and should not be need as a guide by Christians, and other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The transcription work is now getting under way, and since the brethren at Brooklyn have repaired the amplifiers of two out of the three machines in this territory we are getting good results; a fourth has arrived, and the fifth machine is due here in a few weeks. What with these and phonographs, we should hear of quite a large number of people getting the testimony this year now current, if only the brethren will keep record and report</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turkey, of course, has very few people who give heed to Jehovah’s word, but still there are some who desire to know about the Kingdom. There was an increase in the work in Turkey in the year just closed. The total number of placements of books and booklets was 4,420. This is a healthy increase for that country, and we rejoice with the brethren who had to do with putting these in the hands of the people, and who were thus furnished an opportunity of bearing witness to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yugoslavia is another piece of territory that forms a part of the patchwork map of the earth following the World War. Its king was recently assassinated, probably by those who could not use him. One brother who has been very active in the work in Yugoslavia and who represents the Society in a special way was a personal friend of the king and placed in his hands the Society’s literature. The Hierarchy is making it as disagreeable as possible for the witness work in that country, and yet it is progressing. From the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">local manager’s report the following quotation is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Recently the enemy has put forth greater effort to hinder the witness work. We see now Gog uses all the tools at his disposal to do this. Formerly Gog’s agents did not publicly oppose the witness work, but now they are to a great extent using their papers and periodicals to attack us, so that in several instances we deemed it necessary to defend ourselves in the courts. These suits are still pending. This course of action will, by the grace of the Lord, enable us to give a still greater public witness. Therefore, what we do not accomplish by spreading the literature is done by the adversary, and thus the people get the witness and are forced to take their stand. The people in general gladly accept the message, and often we see that through the slanderous writings of our enemies the people are more interested in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Apart from some persecution and even acts of violence on the part of the Catholic clergy and their willing servants, the workers have not met with great difficulties and opposition. Generally speaking, the authorities do not oppose the witness work, although some among them, yielding to the influence of the clergy, identify themselves as enemies of the truth. However, there have been several cases where the authorities protected the workers against the attacks of the clergy. In this country also we see clearly that it is the clergy alone that oppose the work and that the Catholic church leads the opposition. Therefore there is no reason why the Catholic hierarchy should be treated with any consideration and there is every reason why the people should be told that this system is the chief organization against Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year a total of 97,339 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people in Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah having purposed to inaugurate a righteous rule of the world, he is certain to do it The day of the wicked rule is nearly at an end. God has repeatedly expressed his purpose in these words: &quot;They shall know that I am Jehovah. ” He continues to bring forth cumulative evidence to this end. He uses his witnesses to sound his message to those who have a hearing ear, and within a short space of time he will give such an exhibition of his unlimited power that all creation will know that Jehovah is supreme. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ha </span><span class="font5">is now fulfilling his declaration to Satan: &quot;But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, Leaser) The prayer of God’s servants as set forth in the 83d tsalm must be and will be fully answered by Jehovah, because such is his expressed will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of the witness work during the fiscal year just ending brings great satisfaction and comfort to the workers of Jehovah now on earth. Amidst all the cruel persecution of these witnesses and opposition to the Kingdom message the work of giving that testimony goes grandly forward. In previous years a large number of books have been distributed in Germany, but during the fiscal year just closing we have no record whatsoever of the number distributed in Germany. Had the usual amount of distribution taken place in Germany, the net result this year would have exceeded that of any previous year. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year of 1934 was, to wit, 22,041,622; bringing the grand total of distribution since the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font5"> in 1921, up to 178,895,063.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let all who desire to see the world ruled in righteousness give thanks to Jehovah and to his glorious King. &quot;In his name shall the nations hope”; and the blessing of the Lord upon his witness work during the year has increased the hope of those whose hearts are set upon the Kingdom. Their joy finds expression in the words of the psalmist: &quot;This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (Ps. 118:23,24) The evidence is conclusive that the day of deliverance draws near. The day of the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” will complete that deliverance. Somewhat fatigued, but with a burning zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, the anointed of Jehovah, by his grace and in his strength and the strength of the King, will continue to vigorously press on, shouting as we go the battle cry, ‘FOR JEHOVAH AND FOR HIS VINDICATOR!’</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law and the by-laws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society require the holding of an annual meeting on the 31st of October each year. Pursuant to the same and to notice duly published according to law the annual meeting was convened in Pittsburgh, N. S., Allegheny County, Pa., on the 31st day of October, 1934, at 10 o ’clock a m. In the absence of the president, the vice-president, C. A. Wise, presided. The meeting was opened with prayer. C. H. Stewart served in the capacity of secretary pro tem. The purpose of the meeting was stated, and, there being nothing except the routine business to attend to, and there being no one to elect as officers, all the voting upon matters that came before the annual meeting was done </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">viva voce.</span><span class="font5"> On motion duly put and carried it was ordered that the report of the president relating to the work of the Society during the fiscal year be published in the usual form. Motion unanimously carried. On motion duly put and carried the meeting then stood adjourned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark47"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For Jehovah and for Gideon.” —Judg. 7:18, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH visited his covenant people in Israel at a time when they were threatened with destruction at the hand of the enemy. Jehovah now visits his covenant people on earth at the time when the enemy seeks the destruction of God’s remnant people to whom has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. Jehovah caused Gideon and other faithful men to play their respective parts in a prophetic picture. Now Jehovah reveals to his remnant the meaning of that prophetic picture, disclosing to them that the record thereof was made for the aid, comfort and assurance and hope of the remnant.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God furnished Gideon and his men with the evidence that he was backing them up; and hence the remnant go forward with courage and confidence. Some of you may wonder why the Lord permits his faithful witnesses to be hounded and oppressed by the wicked enemy. Bear in mind that the faithful must prove their integrity toward God in order that they may have a part in the vindication of his name. Without strong opposition and persecution at the hand of the enemy the remnant would have no opportunity </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">165 </span><span class="font7">of proving their faithfulness in maintaining their integrity. It must be expected that the year that lies before us will be a very strenuous one. There is no reason to expect that the enemy will relent. There is no reason why the faithful remnant should slack their hands in the performance of their duty. Let the fight go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The text for the year is an appropriate one, not only for this year, but from this time forward until Armageddon is fought and the victory won. The Greater Gideon is in command, and backing him up with absolute and almighty power is Jehovah, the Most High God. Now the enemy shall be forced out and destroyed and the faithful shall be safe. (Deut. 33:26-28) With unfaltering courage and with abounding joy the remnant will now push forward, shouting as they go; “For Jehovah and for His Vindicator.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the name of Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.—Ps. 113:2, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name was once exalted by all intelligent creatures. All knew and delighted in his illustrious fame and honorable reputation. All knew that Jehovah was and is the source of life and that he is the unselfish Giver of every good and perfect gift. But now for centuries the name of Jehovah has been reproached, dishonored and made infamous by Satan and his host of wicked angels and wicked men. The crisis has come, and from this time forth and for evermore the name of Jehovah shall be exalted. The wicked shall perish, and all who receive life everlasting must know and obey and honor and joyfully serve him whose name alone is Jehovah. His illustrious fame and honorable reputation must find a place in the mind of every creature that lives. He has taken out from among earth’s nations a people for his name. To them is given the privilege of now proclaiming his great name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He hath commanded his covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his name.—Ps. Ill: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s covenants are for the purpose of bringing the great issue to a climax and to convince all that he is God. He has placed his name upon his people taken out from among the nations, and who are made a part of his elect servants under Christ the Servant, and this honor he has given to none other. Satan and his servants have defamed Jehovah’s name, but now the time is at hand when his name shall be exalted and only those who love his name shall live. “His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun; and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.” (Ps. 72:17) His covenant people he has chosen and gathered unto himself for his purpose. The new covenant is his instrument to gather unto himself a people to bear testimony to and have part in vindicating his name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not m yourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 11:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now those of the temple who are proving faithful appreciate that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is all-important and that to have part therein these faithful creatures must unselfishly devote themselves to him. Such unselfish devotion to Jehovah is the key of knowledge and understanding. Religious leaders among the Jews by reason of their selfishness took away from themselves and from others the key of knowledge. When Jesus presented to them the truths of the kingdom the Pharisees not only rejected the truth, but caused others to do likewise. The same has been true of the organizations of so-called “Christianity”, particularly of the “man of sin” class. Self-gain blinds one to the proper devotion to God. Thus blinded, one makes no progress in knowledge and understanding. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon.—Dan. 2: 49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in Satan’s world but were no part of it. God permitted them to be there that they might serve as witnesses for him; thus they pictured the company of God's remnant today on earth who are in the world but are not part of it and who are given certain duties to perform as Jehovah’s witnesses, to proclaim the message of the vengeance of our God, calling attention of the people to the vindication of Jehovah’s name by Christ Jesus. Daniel pictured Christ Jesus, who, as the Greater Daniel, sits in Jehovah's palace. Daniel and his three Hebrew brethren were in the world of Babylon bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name and power; even so now Christ Jesus and the remnant are <sup>4</sup> in the midst of the enemy’, bearing testimony to God’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.—Heb. 12:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle was addressing those in Christ Jesus in the new covenant. He did not say, Ye are come to Egypt, or to any part of Satan’s organization, but “unto mount Sion”, which is God’s organization, and means the establishment of the kingdom of God. The building up of Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization, began when his words were fulfilled, to wit, “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” The Lord Jesus Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, then straightway came to the temple. Thereafter the'coming unto Zion ’ is completed with the bringing of the remnant into the opened temple of God. They come unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, which has now descended out of heaven to take charge of the world by its rightful ruler Christ and to vindicate the name of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not.—2 Cor. 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah does not gather his saints unto himself merely for the pleasure of having them with him, but that they might do service concerning his name. Those gathered into the temple, and toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated, have become a part of “the heavens”; hence says the Lord’s prophet: “The heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. ” (Ps. 50: 6) The Lord made the apostle Paul an able minister of the new covenant. Likewise all who are brought to maturity in Christ and into the temple are made ministers of the new covenant. This is particularly true at the inauguration of the covenant. Those receiving this ministry, appreciating the fact that it proceeds from the Lord and that their strength is in the Lord, faint not. They have 'obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful’.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I covenant unto you, as my Father hath covenanted unto me, a kingdom.—Luke 22:29, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah covenanted unto his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, a kingdom, which kingdom is the capital organization of Jehovah, and of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Lord. In God’s due time that kingdom, which is the holy city or heavenly organization, completely dedicated and devoted to Jehovah God, comes down from God out of heaven and takes charge of the affairs of the world. (Rev. 21: 2,10) Jehovah authorizes Christ Jesus to covenant unto his faithful brethren for a part or place in that kingdom, that such faithful ones might be a part of his royal organization. It is the kingdom or holy organization that completely vindicates Jehovah’s name after first bearing testimony to his name. That covenant for the kingdom is separate and distinct from the new covenant, but is closely related thereto. One must be in the new covenant before he can be in the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.—Ps. 25:14. </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s covenant is his will or purpose expressed in his Word, and states the means employed by him to put his will into force and effect. His purpose is certain to be accomplished, and he chooses his means of bringing about its accomplishment. His purpose is a secret, and therefore hid from all creatures who fail to have an appreciation of man’s insignificance and of the goodness and supremacy of Jehovah. The man who does not fear God cannot have a proper appreciation of the relation of the creature to the Creator. It is to the humble-minded and obedient ones who continue to fear God, and who seek to know him, that God reveals his purpose or his covenant. Any man impressed with his own importance does not fear God and is not in position to learn and to appreciate God’s purpose or his covenant W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Belshazzar . . . commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in</span><span class="font5"> J</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">erusalem; that the king, and his princes . . . might drink.—Dan. 5:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The golden vessels here mentioned represented those ■who are now diligent in putting forth their best endeavors to honor Jehovah’s name. At the present time “Christendom’s” elect, the visible seed of the Serpent Satan, would bring greater reproach upon Jehovah’s name by persecuting, humiliating and ill-using God’s faithful remnant who bear testimony to his name and his kingdom and declare the day of his vengeance upon Satan’s organization. Modem Babylon, or “Christendom”, would desecrate these chosen vessels of the Lord by using them in a ridiculous manner and thus in their carousal would make a merry time with them. These temple vessels are for sacred use in Jehovah’s service, and not for any selfish pleasure, which latter use brings further reproach upon his name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep, 0 Lord.—Ps. 36:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By his great executioner Jehovah will mete out exact justice to those who have willfully broken his everlasting covenant concerning sanctity of human life. His judgment toward men is tempered with mercy toward those of good heart and who desire righteousness. He has commanded that his mercy shall be shown toward all those who have been unwittingly drawn into Satan’s trap and caused to break His law. His acts of justice are like the great deep. His mercy en-dureth for ever. Those who desire knowledge and understanding may now learn about the loving-kindness of our God. He has made known to the temple company that he is the fountain of life and that there is none other. He has given them such knowledge not merely for their own good, but that they might make this known to those of good wilt W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord preserveth all them that lovi him: hut dll the wicked will he destroy.—Ps. 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the Creator of all things good. He has never created a wicked thing, because he is holy and all his works are perfect. (Deut. 32:4) The wicked are those who willfully violate God’s law. When a creature becomes wicked, the responsibility for so doing cannot be laid to Jehovah. If the creature yields to sinful temptation or influence and turns to wickedness, it cannot be charged to God, for the reason that God tempts no man. (Jas. 1:13) All the ways of Jehovah God are right and righteous. God hates wickedness, and he has definitely fixed the destiny of the wicked. ‘' The transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.” (Ps. 37: 38) There are wicked spirit creatures and wicked human creatures. The end of all such is destruction. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah writes his law into the heart of those who delight to do his will. His beloved Son, always faithfully devoted to his Father, says: ‘‘I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8) This Psalm expresses the heart condition of those who are in the new covenant and who are diligent in proving their faithfulness to God. The new covenant is made with Christ Jesus in behalf of those who agree to do the will of God, and those who are brought into that covenant, and who continue faithful, must have the law of God written in their hearts and must from the heart declare the righteousness of Jehovah ; otherwise they could not be the ‘people of God taken out for his name’.—Jer. 31:33.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.—Rom. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s unconditional promise to Abraham is called the Abrahamic covenant in that Abraham served to picture Jehovah himself, while Sarah his wife served to picture Jehovah’s organization, which brings forth the seed for his purpose. That is a unilateral or onesided covenant, a declaration of the unchangeable purpose of Jehovah to do a certain thing, and the result thereof does not at all depend upon what Abraham or any other creature might do or fail to do. That covenant announces God’s provision for man to obtain life, for therein it is plainly stated, “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” The blessing of the families of the earth means that God will give them opportunity to live, which opportunity must come in his appointed way, through the promised seed, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~W 7/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah uses the lion as a symbol of justice and judgment. Christ Jesus is the judicial officer of Jehovah to whom is committed all judgment in heaven and in earth, together with the authority and power to execute judgment. (John 5:22-27) Jesus Christ is therefore appropriately named “The Lion of the tribe of Juda”. Of all who praise and serve Jehovah, Christ Jesus is the Head and chief. His judgments are in strict harmony with justice. To the workers of iniquity Christ Jesus the executioner of Jehovah’s judgment is a power of evil, but to those who love and serve Jehovah the Chief Officer is a shield and strength and protection. (Phil. 4:13; 1 Tim. 1:12) It is by the grace of God through Christ Jesus that the victory for the faithful is gained.—1 Cor. 15:57.

<p><span class="font5">Centuries ago God began to bring his name before fallen men. He revealed to Moses his name Jehovah; then to Egypt Jehovah ‘went to redeem unto himself a people and to make him a name’. (2 Sam. 7:23) God did not bodily appear in Egypt, but he sent Moses as his servant. And thus Jehovah appeared there in a representative capacity. Egypt was a type of the world, and Pharaoh its ruler was a type of Satan, the god of this wicked world Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and Servant by whom Jehovah redeems a people for himself and causes the name of the Most High to be put in the right place in the mind of all intelligent creatures. In his due time Jehovah will cause all his creatures to know his name and its meaning and to have in memory the time when he first revealed his name to man as Jehovah ; and that memorable time dates from his going to Egypt. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This prophecy applies entirely to those in the new covenant and who continue faithful. Christ Jesus at the temple is Jehovah’s great High Priest in charge of the temple organization. He is made the Teacher of the temple class; hence he teaches all the children of Zion. Jehovah is the great Teacher, and he and Christ Jesus are the teachers of God’s people; hence the Lord says to his children: “Yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a comer any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.” (Isa. 30:20) Those at the temple are equally favored. They are all on a common level and know God, from the least to the greatest of them. All of these discern that the chief issue is Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s purpose is to vindicate his name. Let that great truth always be foremost in the mind. All other things are incidental to and hence secondary to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Having builded up his capital organization Zion Jehovah now appears in his glory to those of Zion. Zion’s children, now gathered unto him at his temple, are taught of God by and through Christ Jesus, the chief one of the Zion organization. The faithful now see their Teachers, to wit, Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Being obedient to what they are taught, the children of Zion walk on in the right way singing the praises of the Most High. They are Jehovah’s saints now made to ‘sit with Christ Jesus in heavenly places’ and form a part of the heavenly organization. Being thus gathered unto the Lord they shall declare his righteousness. The faithful remnant are doing this very thing. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Armageddon is near at hand. In that battle Christ Jesus, the Vindicator, will destroy the wicked; but the kindness of Jehovah has provided a place of refuge for those who now turn their hearts toward righteousness, seeking to join themselves unto Jehovah’s organization. Such are the Jonadab class. Jehovah’s provision for them is a rich provision. There is an obligation laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses to bring these truths to the attention of the Jonadabs, that they may be advised of the only way of escape in the great world disaster shortly. They must know Jehovah, take their stand on his side, and there remain steadfastly faithful, serving him, if they would receive God’s gift of life through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Such was not a request that Pharaoh or his officers should issue a permit or license to worship or to serve Jehovah, but the same constituted a demand made by the express commandment of Jehovah that Pharaoh and his officers must quit interfering with the chosen people of God in the exercise of their liberty to freely worship and serve Jehovah. Even so now the people taken out for Jehovah’s name, to wit, the remnant, are sent forth by him and commanded to bear testimony before the rulers, and it would be wholly inconsistent for them to ask the rulers if they might preach the gospel, but it is their business to demand that Satan and his representatives cease their interference with Jehovah’s witnesses in delivering this gospel of the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/l/3i</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise-Heb. 10:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If God’s anointed would hold the key of knowledge and understanding they must keep always to the fore that Jehovah’s chief purpose is to vindicate his name, that it is his name that is involved, and that the kingdom is the means used to accomplish that vindication. To have part in vindicating Jehovah’s name is not a selfish work. The part the remnant can have is that of being faithful witnesses for Jehovah. Thus they maintain their integrity toward him. Those of the anointed who are faithful unto death will receive everlasting life and be associated with Christ in his heavenly work and glory. But such reward is secondary to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and is given only where unselfish devotion is shown to God. To have part in vindicating his holy name is the condition precedent to entering into divine life. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/34</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Where a covenant is it is necessary for the death to be brought in of him that hath covenanted; for a covenant over dead persons is firm.—Heb. 9:16,17, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shedding of the blood of Christ Jesus put the new covenant in force. The death of the disciples and the others of the faithful followers of Christ, including the remnant today, was and is entirely unnecessary to the making and putting in operation of the new covenant. In Egypt there was just one sacrifice, the lamb slain, and immediately the law covenant was made and went into effect. Likewise the new covenant went into effect when the anti typical Lamb, Christ Jesus, was slain. The making and operation of the new covenant did not have to wait until the death of the last member of Christ’s body and which must take place at the end of the period of sacrifice. The blood of Christ’s body members is not necessary to the making and operation of the new covenant. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">AH at the temple will realize that their spiritual food comes to them from their Teachers, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and not from any man. In times past Jehovah and Christ Jesus have been pushed on the side and men have been looked to as the teachers in the church; but not so any more, after the cleansing of the temple. Concerning the faithful ones in the temple, and therefore in the new covenant, Jehovah says: ‘ ‘ They shall all know me. ’ ’ This implies that the revelation of Jehovah’s glory from the temple and the revelation of the meaning of his name and titles are made known to all the temple class. Such revelation Jehovah has given to his people taken out for his name, and they appreciate the fact that their greatest privilege is to now have a part in the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/34</span></p>

Angels participated in the inauguration of the old law covenant with Israel. They delivered God’s message with authority from him. God did not permit any disobedience to the message he caused these angels to transmit. (Gal. 3:19 ■ Heb. 2: 2) The words spoken by the angels were to the Israelites at Mount Sinai at the inauguration of the law covenant, and which people were designated as ‘ ‘ the church'that is, a selected or gathered-out people, because they were a people gathered out for Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not be forgotten.—Jer. 50:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This expressed the desire of the fully consecrated to be faithful to the new covenant as the people taken out from the nations for Jehovah’s name. By coming to the Lord and inquiring concerning Zion, Jehovah’s organization, those in line for the kingdom thus pledge themselves to be faithful. The new covenant is inaugurated toward them and also they are taken into the kingdom covenant, being made a part of God’s capital organization and anointed and commissioned to do a specific work in his name. Concerning this the prophecy of Jeremiah 3:14 is written: &quot;Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you; and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That covenant made in Moab foreshadowed the covenant for the kingdom. The Moab covenant was a means instituted to prepare the Israelites to enter into Canaan and to serve God there. It also pictured Jehovah's purpose to do a preparatory work with his people on earth since 1918. At that time in Moab natural Israel was in a land not assigned for its inheritance. Likewise God’s people taken out for his name, that is, spiritual Israel, are in the world but not part of it at the time they are taken into the kingdom covenant. This covenant also was looking to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The remnant were taken into the covenant for the kingdom after 1918 and after the birth of the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">It was upon the plains of Moab that God caused Moses to speak thus to the Israelites. To those toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated and who are brought into the kingdom covenant the words arc repeated by the apostle, and for this reason the apostle adds: “Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” (Heb. 12: 28, 29) The Israelites in Moab were a typical people. The spiritual Israelites taken out from the nations for Jehovah’s name are an anti typical people. To the latter the rules of Jehovah, announced to govern his organization, are unbending and unalterable. These must be obeyed, and woe to him who fails or refuses to obey. Jehovah’s will, or covenant, not only is expressed but is now revealed and continues to be revealed to those in the kingdom covenant who faithfully and joyfully serve the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">The image of gold pictures Satan’s entire organization, both visible and invisible. The “image” was set up in 606 B C., and Satan’s world has continued since; but from and after A D. 1918 Satan lays special stress on his organization because he knows his time is short before the great battle of Armageddon is fought. About 1918 he began to assemble or “gather together” the official element of the whole earth to use them in due time in the battle. Satan’s purpose is to support his side of the controversy and to bring reproach upon God, and to turn all mankind, including true worshipers of Jehovah, away from the true God and to the worship of creatures or the work of creatures’ hands, or to destroy them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah having builded up Zion and gathered unto himself his saints, he gives them a broader view of his loving-kindness than previously it was possible for them to have. Those at the temple, being now in the secret place of the Most High and there taught of God through Christ Jesus, are commanded to go out among the people and from “the housetops” to declare Jehovah’s name, making known to those of good will the loving-kindness of Jehovah to the children of men. This loving-kindness, when known, is precious to those who love Jehovah. They know that their own refuge is under the shadow of the wings of the Almighty, and they delight to point others to God’s provision for their refuge.

They will fight on Satan’s side at Armageddon and suffer complete defeat. “The sons of God” are angels that were once holy and in Jehovah’s service but did not join Satan in his rebellion, but afterwards yielded to his subtle and wicked influence, became disobedient, thus losing the privilege and opportunity of serving Jehovah, and have since been imprisoned.

<p><span class="font5">In that transfiguration scene Elias (Elijah) pictured Christ Jesus doing a certain work concerning the kingdom, to wit, the work of ‘preparing the way before the Lord’. Moses pictured Christ Jesus the great Prophet, Priest and King and who therefore is the Executive Officer of Jehovah. That transfiguration had reference to God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus his mighty Vindicator. This is made certain by the words of verse 1. “A voice came out of the cloud ■[symbolic of Jehovah’s presence], saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.” (Mark 9:7) That is to say, the dramatic transfiguration there pictured Christ Jesus, God’s beloved Son, his great High Priest, whom all men must obey because God had sent him forth as his vindicator to carry out his purpose.

The Lord Jesus at the temple uses the faithful remnant on earth in connection with his work in serving notice upon the visible part of Satan’s organization, and of this fact the invisible part of that organization no doubt takes notice. Thus God causes Christ Jesus to bring forcibly to the enemy’s attention notice and warning of the enemy’s early downfall. Jehovah does nothing in the dark, but acts against the enemy only after full warning, and he causes his witnesses to openly and aboveboard declare his judgments against the enemy. The enemy will never be able to say they did not hear and that they unintentionally overlooked what Jehovah said. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Among those who name and serve Jehovah God there are “vessels” of honor and “vessels” of dishonor. (2 Tim. 2:19, 20) The vessels of honor are those truly and faithfully devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom interests. The vessels of dishonor are those assuming to represent God and who misuse their opportunities because of selfishness and wickedness. Many have been perplexed as to why Jehovah would permit the wicked to continue to exercise power over earth after he has set his King upon his “holy hill” and caused him to begin his judgments. Manifestly the reason is that he might cause a witness to be given to his name and might manifest his supreme power and demonstrate his riches of glory on those faithful to him.

Now Satan’s earthly representatives are given full warning, time and opportunity to put on identification garments before Jehovah takes final action against them. Jehovah’s supremacy must be made known to the rulers, and his witnesses must declare his supremacy and the greatness of his name throughout the earth. It therefore must displease Jehovah for anyone to ask permission of antitypical Pharaoh and his officers that he might go about and preach the gospel.

The promised seed is Christ, whom Jehovah constitutes as his chief witness, higfi priest and vindicator. Surely the selection of the seed was not merely for man’s salvation, because God could have killed Adam and started a new race. The selection of the seed was for the very purpose of vindicating Jehovah’s name, proving Jehovah carries out his purposes according to his will.

The new covenant applies exclusively to those consecrated to do God’s will. It is through such consecrated ones that God takes out a people for his name. He sanctifies them for his purpose. The Scriptures call the new covenant the &quot;everlasting covenant&quot; for the reason that it is a part of the original expressed purpose of Jehovah to bring forth a seed, the primary purpose of which seed is to accomplish the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

We have now reached the end of the world, not merely the end of a certain time, the end of the age, but the end of the operation of Satan’s organization by sufferance of Jehovah, and hence the time when preparation is being made to completely destroy Satan’s power and organization. Jehovah has taken out of the nations a people for his name; hence the climax of the new covenant is reached, and now the teaching of God’s people is no longer done by men, particularly by such men as &quot;elective elders’’, but all in Zion are children of God by his organization and are now taught of God.— Isa. 54:13.

<p><span class="font5">The real and greater dedication of the image of gold, or Satan’s organization, takes place after the beginning of God’s kingdom, in 1914, when Christ Jesus was placed upon his throne and sent forth to rule. The beginning of the kingdom was a challenge to Satan’s organization. Henee all the official element of Satan’s organization must take their stand for one or the other of these organizations, and thus clearly identify themselves. The Devil's purpose in forcing this identification after the ‘birth of the man child’, the kingdom, is that he might “get” or destroy Jehovah's witnesses.

It gives to such faithful ones a light of knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purpose, revealing to them the Lord’s glory. But the faithful do not take this honor or glory to themselves, realizing that it is from the Lord. In humility and gladness of heart they walk on in the Lord’s presence.

Now at the temple the “old men’’ who are complainers, faultfinders, selfish ones and opposers, are not taken into the kingdom, but are debarred from entering. When the Israelites left Mount Sinai they were in line for the promised land, but only a few entered. Up to the Lord’s coming to the temple many spiritual Israelites were in line for the kingdom, but those who committed the “sin of Samaria’’, who complain, find fault and oppose and fear to boldly proclaim the message cf God’s kingdom against the enemy are left out.

<p><span class="font5">Fear does not mean merely respect, honor and reverence for God. It means much more than that. The man who realizes that God is all-powerful and that He cannot look with approval upon anything unrighteous, and who learns and appreciates that all men are imperfect and of themselves could not stand before God and live, such a man then begins to fear God; and that is the beginning of wisdom. He must have some knowledge of God before he can start in the way of acquiring wisdom. He who fears God desires to learn concerning God's will and then to do it. The more he learns, the more he appreciates the fact of his imperfections and his inability to stand before the great Creator. He continues then to grow in godly fear. In this attitude of mind he is in position to be taught and choose the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/34</span></p>

Any creature entering into a covenant with Jehovah must have a standing before God, which standing means that the creature is actually justified or that by reason of his faith God counts him as justified. The new covenant was made with Christ Jesus and afterwards with only those who, first having exercised faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, made a consecration to do God's will, thereby entering into an agreement by sacrifice, and who were then justified. God has expressly provided that life shall come to those of the human race who have real faith in the blood of Christ Jesus.—Rom. 6: 23. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/34:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These cities of refuge provided by God’s law were a place of protection for those who had unawares broken His everlasting covenant by taking human life. This loving provision by Jehovah being announced at the time of making the covenant with Israel in Moab shows that the cities of refuge foreshadow God's loving-kindness for protection of people of good will during Armageddon; that Jehovah’s anointed remnant on earth have a positive obligation now to be performed toward those of the Jonadab company; and that the Jonadabs must perform certain specific requirements in order to be assured of refuge during the trouble, and to ultimately receive life.

That company of wicked angels fought with Satan at the time Christ cast Satan and his host out of heaven, and their operations are now confined to things pertaining to earth.

<p><span class="font5">Truly the names of these are enrolled in heaven since Zion has brought forth her children, and their citizenship is in heaven. The faithful saints who long ago died in faith have first been resurrected and gathered to Zion. Those remaining on earth are now ‘caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air’. The scripture identifies the time, when it says: “And to God [Jehovah] the Judge of all.” Jehovah is the Judge over all. His judgment first begins at the house of God when Christ Jesus, the duly appointed Judge, there appears and begins judgment for the purpose of purifying the “sons of Levi”. (Mal. 3:3) That judgment determines who shall be approved and anointed to offer unto God an offering in righteousness.—Heb. 13:15.

<p><span class="font5">From 1926 to 1933 Jehovah’s message of warning heralded by his faithful witnesses was boldly delivered and raised high by wide publication. Thus “Christendom” was compelled to take notice thereof. Her rulers have seen Jehovah’s human agents used to give them warning notice, and they have heard the notice, but they have not seen or discerned Jehovah’s spirit which moves such servants to bring that warning notice to them. The handwriting on the wall was by God’s power. It foretells the doom of Satan’s organization, Babylon, including “Christendom”. Notice and warning must be delivered before execution of the judgment. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses engage in declaring the day of vengeance of our God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Beginning of judgment by Christ Jesus in 1918 marks the time for beginning the testing of all creatures who claim to be servants of Jehovah and his kingdom. Whether the end of that testing be honor or dishonor and destruction is determined by the course of action taken with reference to God’s kingdom interests. Those of “Christendom”, particularly the ecclesiastics thereof, take unto themselves the honor of the kingdom covenant with God. The rulers set up the League of Nations as a substitute for God’s kingdom. The “man of sin”, while claiming to represent God, joins in the conspiracy against Jehovah’s faithful remnant; while the remnant continues to faithfully advertise the King and kingdom. Respectively these classes show by the course of action taken whether they are vessels of dishonor or vessels of honor. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/l/3t</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The rod in the hand of the antitypical Moses is a symbol of the authority and power which Jehovah has fully delegated to Christ Jesus and which he uses to execute Jehovah’s purposes. Now the announcement to the world rulers that Christ Jesus, the great Judge, has come to the temple for judgment is a warning to all sueh of the punishment God will inflict upon his enemies culminating in complete destruction of the world at Armageddon. Moses’ rod was employed by Moses and Aaron in invoking the ten plagues upon Egypt, including the death of the firstborn. Here Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, while Aaron pictured the body members of Christ to whom is committed the “testimony of Jesus Christ’’ and who deliver the testimony. That rod stretched forth symbolically said that this is done by authority of Jehovah. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He will ever be mindful of his covenant.—Ps. 111:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A covenant is a binding agreement or promise to do or not to do a certain thing. Jehovah’s expressed purpose to do a certain thing is an unconditional or one-sided covenant. When he gives his word of promise he unconditionally binds himself to carry out that purpose. He says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” “My word . . . shall accomplish that which I please.” A covenant made by Jehovah with one or more of his creatures is a bilateral or two-sided agreement to do certain things, and the other parties to the covenant must do the things mentioned. Jehovah always faithfully performs his part of the covenant. All his covenants made toward man are made for the primary purpose of vindicating his name. They are called Jehovah’s covenants because he is the originator and maker of them, and he takes others into his covenants as it pleases him.

<p><span class="font5">There was a time when iniquity was upon Jehovah’s covenant people, which lawlessness or iniquity embraces man worship, formalism, particularly a failure to bear testimony to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Such was largely due to ignorance, and the ignorance of God’s law is an excuse. Forgiveness of their iniquity is directly related to the great revelation that came to them when gathered to the Lord God at his temple. Iniquity here mentioned is not inherited sin from Adam, because the ones addressed have been previously made free of that sin by Christ’s precious blood applied to them when justified. Forgiveness is not granted in order that the covenant people might be taken to heaven, but is for the sake of Jehovah’s name, that these cleansed ones might be made a people ready for his name and to testify to his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Satan’s organization on earth has willfully broken God’s everlasting covenant by wantonly and cruelly killing human creatures. God declares his purpose to destroy Satan’s official organization on earth because of the violation of the covenant. Since the coming of Jesus to the temple great persecution has been heaped upon God’s people in the land of “Christendom”; there is bloodguiltiness on the part of those who have participated in this persecution deliberately. Those who have unwittingly supported those wrongdoers must have some way of escape, otherwise they would fall in the great trouble in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Jehovah in his loving-kindness has made just such a provision as is needed for their escape; the cities of refuge pictured that way of escape. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/34</span></p>

The host of wicked ones occupied a place known in Scripture as Magog. Jesus referred to Satan as the “prince [invisible ruler] of this world”. Since Satan is called Beelzebub, meaning prince or chief one of devils, there are many other like ones, that is, wicked angels or spirits. Beyond all doubt there is a host of wicked angels or spirit creatures. Satan the Devil is the chief one of that wicked company, and all of such are enemies of God and the mortal enemies of every one who seeks to do God’s will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/34</span></p>

The clergy in general, and others that go to make up the “man of sin ’ ’, while claiming to represent God and his kingdom, are violently opposed to the kingdom and have persecuted those whom Jehovah has taken out as a people for his name and who are delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ. These opposers of Jehovah have had every opportunity to hear the truth, but they refused to learn and to give heed to the truth; therefore they put on the garments of Baal and plainly identify themselves with God’s great enemy. “But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs [Jannes’ and Jambres’] also was.”—2 Tim. 3:7-9.

<p><span class="font5">Abraham was here used as a symbol to represent Jehovah God himself, who alone is the Giver of life, hence the great Father of the families and nations of the earth that live. Abraham’s seed is Christ, by and through whom Jehovah gives life to man. (Rom. 6: 23) When Jehovah said to Abraham, “I will . . . make thy name great, ’ ’ manifestly God meant that he would make his own holy name great. The dealing of Jehovah with the Hebrews, the natural descendants of Abraham, was for his (Jehovah’s) own name’s sake. (Ezek. 20: 9) The purpose of the Abrahamic covenant, therefore, was not primarily for man's benefit, but was and is for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. This conclusion is abundantly supported by the Scriptures. Salvation of creatures is entirely secondary to the great purpose of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God does not require of his children the doing of impossible things. Increased responsibility falls upon all who have been brought into the kingdom covenant, and necessarily curses are incorporated in the terms of the covenant for those who willfully disobey. (Deuteronomy 27-29) The statement concerning curses or punishments is not made to terrify one into obedience, but to warn against what to avoid. Jehovah has taken out a people for his own great and holy name, and he cannot and will not permit these to be contaminated by the Devil’s organization and at the same time continue in Jehovah’s organization. In this connection he announces his blessings upon those who do obey from a pure heart.—Deut. 30:1-10. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Who are the “them that are sanctified” here mentioned ? Manifestly those who are brought into Christ. “For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.” (Heb. 2:11) By what means are they sanctified? By “the blood of the [new] covenant, wherewith he was sanctified”. (Heb. 10:29) Thus the inspired apostle specifically applies the terms of the new covenant to the sanctified ones. That new covenant was made with Christ Jesus at the time of his death for and in behalf of his sanctified ones; it is the instrument of Jehovah by which he takes out from the nations a people for his name.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus was made mediator while on earth 1900 years previous to the inauguration of the covenant; but now having come to the temple and gathered unto himself his faithful, he inaugurates the covenant in heaven toward those found faithful up to this point and who have been made to “sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus” with him. Though Abel was entirely innocent when killed at the instance of Satan, his blood was merely that of an imperfect man. Jesus’ blood “speaketh better things than that of Abel”. This “blood of sprinkling”, or the blood of the new covenant; is the blood of the Perfect One, the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah, and hence has redemptive value and validates the covenant, giving security of its benefits to those who have been brought into the new covenant.

They claim to be for Jehovah, but they are not, even as the Israelites of old claimed to be for God, but were not. As God was angry with natural Israel, so was he angry with the professed spiritual Israel at the Lord’s coming to the temple. This included all under the terms of the new covenant and who had not been bold in declaring the message of God’s kingdom; also those that had conferred great honor upon men. The remnant of fleshly Israel was saved.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s order of judgment seems to be clearly foreshadowed by the above.

Seir, mentioned as second, pictures the “evil servant” class, the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” Mount Paran seems well to picture the “elective elder” class once in line for the kingdom, for at the wilderness of Paran Jehovah cleared out the unfaithful elders.—Num. 13: 26-14: 39.

Then Jehovah made the covenant and led them out of Egypt to Mount Sinai, where the covenant was inaugurated with fitting ceremonies. Before anyone could be brought into the new covenant the antitypical lamb must be slain. Those brought into the covenant must first be ransomed and be a redeemed people. These are redeemed “with the precious blood of Christ [Jesus], as of a lamb without blemish and without spot”. (1 Pet. 1:19) The purpose of the new covenant is to take out from the nations of the world a peculiar people, zealous for good works, that is, of bearing witness to and having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">This does not mean cleansing from inherited sins, but cleansing from sins that attach to the church at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. Being cleansed, these approved ones are covered with the robe of righteousness and given the garments of salvation, and they are greatly refreshed and rejoice. At the invitation of Christ Jesus, these approved ones enter into the joy of the Lord. (Matt. 25:21) They are brought into the temple, and the new covenant is inaugurated toward them. It is a time of great refreshing to the cleansed ones. This time of refreshing could not come until after Jesus was sent forth by Jehovah to rule amongst his enemies, and that was done in 1914.

(Num. 35:7) This shows that the peoples of “Christendom” have no right to crowd Jehovah’s servants, and particularly his anointed witnesses, out of the land, but must allow them freedom of activity and a reasonable amount for their maintenance. This also supports the conclusion that those who obtain literature, and thus receive an opportunity to gain knowledge and understanding of the truth concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, should contribute something to defray expense of publication, that more books may be brought to the people by Jehovah’s witnesses that other people might know Jehovah’s name and his loving-kindness.

The Devil had tried to hide from “Christendom” knowledge of even his existence and also the existence of his organization. By this means he expected to entrap them all. Now Jehovah causes Satan’s organization to be brought to light, and causes his own witnesses to give testimony concerning it, particularly as a warning to all people of good will, and as a notice and warning to the nations of the earth in general. To offset Jehovah’s purpose Satan brings forth his organization as a thing to be worshiped, adored and served.

Likewise all judgments of Christ Jesus are just, true and righteous and in harmony with the divine law. With Jehovah his law and equity are the same.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, applying his words to the “day of the Lord”, speaks of his witnesses which are now as ‘an altar to the Lord, and a pillar in the border of Egypt’. The time of fulfilment of this prophecy is in the day when God serves notice first and then expresses his vengeance against Satan’s organization. Jehovah has taken out his faithful ones, spiritual Israelites, and has made them his witnesses to declare his name in the earth. The prophecy of Jeremiah 32: 20, 21 now applies concerning Jehovah, “which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day: and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/34</span></p>

All are in it, and the attempt is to force everybody to stand before the Devil’s organization. In 1922, when the attention of God’s faithful witnesses on earth began to be called to the fact of the existence of Satan’s powerful organization, the faithful then began to take their stand before it, but against it and definitely on Jehovah’s side, as pictured by the three Hebrews in Babylon who took their stand on Jehovah’s side.

It therefore applies to the church, and not to the world at all. The new covenant was foreshadowed by the old law covenant with Israel, as well as being a replacement substituted for the law covenant. That being true, then, it follows that the purpose of the law covenant foreshadowed the purpose of the new covenant. The purpose of the old law covenant could not have been salvation of the Jewish nation. It was not needed to save that nation. Eventually Gentiles will have the same opportunity of salvation. The Jewish nation, being God’s chosen people, did not foreshadow Gentile nations in general, but foreshadowed God’s chosen people taken out from the world.

<p><span class="font5">The slaying and eating of the lamb preceded the slaughter of Egypt’s firstborn. Even so the death of ' ‘ Christ, our passover ’ ’, and the partaking of his merit by the spirit-begotten ones, precede the slaughter of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. The typical lamb was taken in on the tenth day of Nisan. Antitypically this means (in the present “day of Jehovah” since 1918) the receiving of the Lamb as Jehovah’s King enthroned in office, hence the receiving of the Kingdom and undertaking full responsibility of the kingdom interests. On the tenth of Nisan, A.D. 33, Jesus rode into Jerusalem and offered himself as King. This shows that receiving the Lamb into the house since A.D. 1918 signifies far more than accepting Jesus as the ransom sacrifice.

At Mount Sinai Moses set up a witness by building an altar and twelve pillars. Then he sent young men &quot;which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord”. Those &quot;young men” seemed to picture the remnant described by the prophet Joel (2:28), saying: &quot;I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and . . . your young men shall see visions.” Since 1918, and more particularly since 1922, the remnant have been sent forth as Jehovah’s witnesses to offer to the Lord, and before the people, ‘sacrifices of peace and thanksgiving,’ &quot;an offering in righteousness.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those begotten of the spirit have Jehovah for their spiritual Father. This is true even while these creatures have an organism of flesh. The expression ‘ ‘spirits of just men made perfect” therefore properly applies to the present-day remnant of spiritual Israel who now are &quot;spiritually minded”. (Rom. 8:6) Many begotten of the spirit do not prove faithful and are therefore not ‘perfected in the spirit’, whereas the remnant found faithful at the temple judgment and made members of the 'elect servant’ class are perfected. They were righteous at the time begotten of the holy spirit, and counted as God’s sons, and now as such righteous ones they ate perfected.

Those taken into the covenant have entered into the joy of the Lord and are now greatly rejoicing that they are privileged to bear testimony to his holy name.

There must be no murmurers, complainerg, opposers, or selfish, rebellious ones who abide in the kingdom covenant. Those at the cleansed temple are at unity in Christ.

The Israelites must abide in the house, under the blood, until morning; which anti-typically means that Jehovah’s remnant are now hidden and are kept “in the secret place of the Most High”, under the protection of Jehovah and his Vindicator, and are thus protected &quot;until the indignation be overpast”.

Since Adam had become a sinner, Jehovah had been striving with humankind; he had been judging men as to their integrity. Since the time of Enos men had been 'calling themselves by the Lord’s name’, manifestly to bring reproach upon God’s name, in the same manner as many men today call themselves Christians but openly bring reproach upon the name of God and Christ. God’s announcement is, in effect, that flesh is not to for ever insult Jehovah’s name. Being flesh, man could not therefore go on for ever mocking God, the great Spirit. Provoking God shows that man had not the correct appreciation of what man is as compared with the great Creator. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/34</span></p>

It is the covenant or purpose of Jehovah that must be declared, and no one must add to or take from that expressed purpose as set forth in his Word. The present time, therefore, is a day of deliberate decision, with full responsibility resting on those brought into the covenant for the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">In this day of Jehovah the eating of the lamb includes not only partaking of his merit, which cleanses from sin, but also the having a share in the doing of the work which Jesus Christ was sent to earth to do, to wit, to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah to the vindication of his holy name, hence also entering into the joy of the Lord, which is now the strength of the remnant. Furthermore it means that there must be no uncleanness in God’s organization or among his people resulting from coming in contact with or compromising with the Devil’s organization. There must be no “leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy’’, meaning the failure or refusal to confess the Lord before men.

<p><span class="font5">Setting up cities of refuge was notice to those having need therefor that God had made provision for their protection and refuge in time of distress. This prophecy must have fulfilment at the coming of the Greater Moses. February 24,1918, by the Lord’s grace and manifestly by his overruling providence, there was delivered, at Los Angeles, California, for the first time the message “The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Thereafter that message was proclaimed throughout “Christendom”. No one of God’s people understood fully the matter at that time; but since being brought into God’s temple they understand that those on earth who may live and not die are the ones who now 'get into the chariot’, as Jonadab at Jehu’s invitation got into the chariot with Jehu.

Since only a small remnant of natural Israel accepted Jesus Christ and were transferred to him and became spiritual, the required 144,000 members of Christ’s body must be made up from the Gentiles, those other than Jews. For three and one-half years after Pentecost the gospel was taken exclusively to the Jews that they might have an opportunity to become spiritual. At the end of that time the gospel was taken to Jews and Gentiles, Cornelius being the first Gentile to become a follower of Christ. That marked the “fulness of the Gentiles” coming in.

Having undertaken to do God’s will, and having no desire to violate any just or righteous law, these faithful servants of the Lord say: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” Where the law of this world contravenes God’s law they must obey God’s law at any cost.

The words of Mark 9:12, “ The Son of man . . . must suffer many things, and be set at nought,” show that the complete fulfilment of the prophecy concerning Elijah must be preceded by the sufferings of Christ Jesus, all of which pertains to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus did suffer death, was raised from the dead, and went away to receive the kingdom, the setting up of which must be preceded by a restitution work.

<p><span class="font5">A memorial marks a day or time certain when some great thing is done which is to be ever afterwards remembered. Among the great things performed by Jehovah by his servant Moses were these: The revelation of his name, the making of the law covenant with Israel, the destruction of Pharaoh’s organization, and the deliverance of the Israelites from that oppressive organization. The pivotal point of these great events was the slaying of the passover lamb, because it pointed to the One whom God had ordained to be the vindicator of his great and holy name. All the things performed in Egypt by man as God’s representative and servant were incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which is the all-important thing. Because the slaying and eating of the paschal lamb pointed to Jesus, the vindicator, Jehovah said to Moses: “This day shall be unto you for a memorial.” IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is true that the blood signifies that those under it say, “I accept Christ Jesus’ blood as my redemptive price ’ ’; but to the remnant it means much more. Being the blood of the Victim which validates the new covenant, it signifies that the firstborn of the remnant have entered into that new covenant, the primary purpose of which is to produce a people for Jehovah’s name and who will have a part in vindicating that holy name. Upon the remnant the Most High has bestowed the “new name”, thus showing them to be a “people for his name”. The blood on the door entrances therefore pictures that the new covenant has been inaugurated toward the remnant and hence they must be faithful to that new name and must continue to faithfully bear testimony to Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">God made the old law covenant with Moses as mediator for his chosen people. He made the new covenant with Christ Jesus, whom Moses foreshadowed, as Mediator for his chosen ones. Jehovah sent Moses to Egypt primarily to make a name for Himself, and secondarily to redeem the Israelites. (2 Sam. 7:23) To this end Moses was required to bear testimony before the Israelites and before the Egyptian ruler, and this he must do prior to the making of the law covenant. Jehovah sent Jesus into the world, antitypical Egypt, to bear witness to his name, hence to make a name for Himself, and he must bear witness before the Jews and others before the new covenant is made. (John 18:37) He said: &quot;I am come in my Father’s name.” (John 5:43) That the chief purpose of the coming of Jesus was to glorify and vindicate Jehovah’s name is shown by his words.-John 12: 27, 28.

<p><span class="font5">The time is rapidly approaching when the firstborn of antitypical Egypt must die. As the blood of the passover lamb sprinkled on the doorposts of the houses in Egypt signified life and preservation to those who remained inside the house and under the protection of that blood-sign, so those trusting in the precious blood of Christ Jesus, and who have been in and remain in the new covenant, have this added assurance of life and preservation. The Lord’s supper, properly celebrated to ‘‘show the Lord’s death till he come”, has been a guarantee of their preservation. Now, however, the Lord has come, and his shed blood bespeaks that this is the day of Jehovah’s vengeance and destruction of Satan’s firstborn of this world. To properly celebrate the Lord's supper now one must certainly show consistency by proclaiming the day of God’s vengeance against the enemy’s firstborn.

<p><span class="font5">In Egypt Moses was a type of Jesus. As Moses could not be put to death and at the same time complete the type, the lamb was slain in his stead. It was the lamb’s blood that sanctified, perfected and made operative the law covenant. Jesus’ blood shed at Calvary made operative the new covenant on the day of his death. Immediately preceding his death he took the cup of wine, symbolic of his blood, and said to his disciples: “This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. ’' His shed blood was both for making complete and for putting in operation the new covenant, and also served as the redemptive price for mankind. Only by faith in his shed blood can one be brought into a covenant with God. Prior to the exercise of such faith all were aliens from God.

<p><span class="font5">Making the covenant is one thing; the inauguration thereof is another and later thing. The covenant is made by Jehovah with the one competent to enter into an agreement, hence with the mediator, in behalf of all who shall be brought under the terms of or into the covenant. Inauguration means the appropriate ceremonies inducting one into office and investing him with specific authority. The inauguration of the new covenant is the appropriate ceremonies inducting into office and vesting with specific authority those selected to perform the duties enjoined on them by the covenant. The primary purpose of the new covenant is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. To this end he takes out a people for his name who, proving faithful up to a certain point, are invested with authority to be the witnesses to his name.

<p><span class="font5">The blood of the paschal lamb was publicly sprinkled on the doorposts and lintels of the Israelites’ houses. Antitypically that not only means a public confession of Jesus’ blood as Jehovah’s provided redemptive price for mankind, but also signifies to the remnant that all of that class are Judeans, that is, praisers of Jehovah, and are subject to the orders of Jehovah’s Vindicator, the Greater Moses; and further, that the day of God’s vengeance is here, which vengeance shortly will be exercised in the destruction of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. Therefore the blood was both a public declaration and a testimony of approaching destruction upon Jehovah’s enemies.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah made curses and blessings very prominent in the covenant made in Moab. This shows that Jehovah would bring to those in line for the kingdom a full knowledge of the consequences of whichever course they might choose to take, and that he would also make plain to the faithful the subject concerning the “evil servant’’ class as well as that of the “faithful and wise servant” class, disclosing the sharp contrast between them. Not only that, but that he would cause the sins of the “evil servant” class to be boldly pronounced or cried out by his faithful witnesses on earth. The great Judge, Christ Jesus, now sits in judgment. Those gathered unto him and into the kingdom covenant participate, in this, that they announce the judgments already written.

<p><span class="font5">During the World War, particularly the years 1917 and 1918, spiritual Israel was in a wilderness condition. Fiery trials came upon those consecrated to God. A separating work followed. Passing through that affliction those found faithful to the Lord up to that time were taken into the bonds of the new covenant. They passed under the rod of kingly authority of Christ Jesus who had been sent out from Zion to rule and who was now at the temple for the purging of the “sons of Levi”. Then Jehovah by Christ Jesus fulfilled his promise to “purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: . . . and ye shall know that I am the Lord”. (Verse 38) This separating work began and continued until the cleansing of the sanctuary was accomplished. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/34</span></p>

Sacrificial provisions, which prefigured the ransom sacrifice and atonement work of Christ, would of themselves be insufficient and unavailing for those taken out as a people for Jehovah’s name as against their going into captivity to Satan’s organization, and into death, unless they were wholly obedient to their vows.

The natural Israelites were a typical people, the antitype of which are those who covenant to do God’s will. Such are designated spiritual Israelites. Christ Jesus was by human birth a natural Israelite. The new covenant, however, was made with him after he was made the Head of the spiritual house of Israel. Others were invited into the covenant after they had accepted Christ Jesus as God’s promised Seed, and hence after they had become spiritual Israelites.

<p><span class="font5">Those who now properly partake of the Lord’s supper as a memorial to Jehovah’s name must have an active personal part in the performance of the ten antitypical plagues upon antitypical Egypt, Satan’s organization. Each one must participate in proclaiming the message of God in connection with these plagues. The plagues are now in operation, advancing to the great climax of destruction of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. To partake worthily of the Memorial one must have part in declaring these truths as Christ has commanded. Moses and Aaron declared God’s word to the Egyptians, which resulted in the plagues. Moses typified Christ Jesus, and Aaron, his spokesman, represented those of the temple class, the remnant, now on earth, declaring the message of God’s vengeance and bearing testimony of his kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These six cities were assigned to those who had been redeemed or purchased by Jehovah in place of Israel’s firstborn and who had been assigned exclusively to God’s service. (Num. 3:11-51) The six cities thus appointed picture the organization of Jehovah’s anointed ones yet on earth, representing Zion, the holy city, since it is builded up. Such cities of protection symbolized the organization of those who are wholly devoted to God and his temple. There was no other place that the manslayer could find refuge or safety. This is strong proof that the Jonadab class who seek refuge against the day of God’s vengeance must find it only in “Jehu’s chariot’’, that is, in the organization of Jehovah, of which organization Christ Jesus is the Head and great High Priest. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">be an hundred and twenty years.—Gen. 6: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was no need for Jehovah to prolong for ever the controversy as to man’s integrity, as though man could continue to strive with his Creator and Judge in the same manner that he strives against an adversary at law. But why should God suffer sinful man with no integrity toward Jehovah to continue 120 years longer! It was during that 120 years that he caused a great witness to be given to his name, and at the end of that 120 years he brought about the world’s complete destruction, foreshadowing the destruction of the world at Armageddon. In this manner Jehovah shows that he had timed the world’s destruction by the flood and that he would allow ample time before that to serve notice on men and their superhuman sons-in-law, the incarnated “sons of God”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To refuse to obey the king’s command would be a challenge to his supremacy and the legitimacy of the image he erected. Now the question of supremacy is brought to the fore; Satan boldly claims he is supreme; therefore everyone is forced to take his stand either on the Devil’s side or on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. The visible part of Satan’s organization today insists that the power of the state is supreme and everyone must submit thereto regardless of whether the rule promulgated is contrary to God’s law or not. Those who now stand firm for God and his kingdom and refuse to compromise do thereby declare that this worldly organization ruled by Satan is a fraudulent thing reproaching Jehovah’s name.

This supports the conclusion that Satan makes a desperate attempt to overthrow everyone worthily partaking of the Memorial. Let all such, then, have absolute and complete faith in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and remain firm and steadfast, regardless of all opposition, and continue to proclaim the name of Jehovah faithfully unto the end. So doing, they may be assured of complete deliverance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and be for ever the favored servants of the Most High. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Vindication of Jehovah’s name was the paramount issue in Daniel’s day and is still such. Daniel had been in Babylon for years and had proved himself a faithful and true witness to God’s name. He was now of a good old age, and still the Lord would use him to bear testimony. For about 1900 years God has been taking out from the world his church and using such to be his witnesses, and even now, in the old age of the church, in these “last days’’ the faithful are having greater opportunities of bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name. The picture made in connection with Daniel’s appearing before the king of Babylon indicates that God’s remnant would be given a greater privilege and responsibility to be witnesses to the name of the Most High and to bear testimony before world rulers to God’s name and kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">This must be done in fulfilment of the divinely given commandment: “Proclaim . . . the day of vengeance of our God.” (Isa. 61:2) As Aaron acted as the mouthpiece and proclaimer for Moses (who typified Christ Jesus) in proclaiming God’s vengeance against Pharaoh and his organization, even so now those in the covenant with Christ Jesus must likewise proclaim God’s vengeance against Satan’s firstborn and all of his organization, because they “have the testimony of Jesus Christ” and keep God’s commandment. Those who would partake of the Memorial supper and theu fail or refuse to obey the commandments to be Jehovah’s witnesses would thereby partake unworthily: “For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.”—1 Cor. 11:29. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s primary purpose in sending Moses to Egypt was to place before the Egyptian ruling class, and before the people, the proof that he is the Supreme One. His primary purpose in sending Jesus, the antitypical Moses, to earth at both his first and his second coming is to place before the creation of the world the proof that Jehovah is the Almighty and that there is none besides him. This he does for his own name's sake, that all may know that life and attending blessings come from God, and from him only. This conclusion is proved by his words to Moses that &quot;the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah”. (Ex. 7:5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Moses was Jehovah’s instrument in Egypt to place the evidence before the people.

<p><span class="font5">This proves that a people was foreshadowed by the Israelites and that such people foreshadowed by the Israelites in the law covenant must prove their faithfulness under the terms of the new covenant in order to become God’s holy nation. Addressing that people foreshadowed by the Israelites the inspired apostle says: &quot;Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. ” (1 Pet. 2: 9,10) This holy nation is made up of those who become members of God’s royal house of which Christ Jesus is the Head.

<p><span class="font5">Hidden worship by Jehovah’s witnesses might be carried on by praying to him and talking secretly to others about his kingdom without even the hierarchy’s knowing it. But such hidden worship would be positive evidence of fear of men, and a taeit admission that Jehovah is not supreme and cannot protect and deliver his own. That is exactly what Satan desires to accomplish. The Lord foreknew this and warns that the fear of man leadeth into a snare but the fear of the Lord tendeth to life. (Prov. 29: 25; 19: 23) To be a true worshiper of Almighty God one must obey his commandment, “Ye are my witnesses”; that is, you must make known to others that your trust is in Jehovah and that he is the only source of life and the one to whom all proper petition can be presented with certainty of having the same answered.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ death in the place of the sinner, and his faithfulness unto death, were not merely to furnish the redemptive price for man, but also to prove his own qualifications to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name. Being thus perfected, Christ Jesus became Jehovah’s “high priest for ever” and the vindicator of his name. The greatest thing to be kept in memory is the name of Jehovah, and Paul intimated that at the coming of Jesus to the temple this important truth would clearly be understood. By partaking of the “Lord’s supper” until his coming to the temple of Jehovah his faithful disciples have shown forth the Lord’s death; but now these faithful ones gathered by the Lord Jesus unto himself are ‘drinking the fruit of the vine with him new', and all are rejoicing and praising the name of Jehovah and must do so for ever.

<p><span class="font5">Others may engage in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, but it is those who partake of the death of Christ Jesus who are the ones that ultimately live with him. Those who suffer the reproaches that reproached him by reason of being Jehovah’s faithful witness, even to the end, are the ones that will ultimately reign with him. Jehovah gave to Jesus the privilege and honor of being His vindicator at cost of his human life. All who are with him in that vindication must likewise die sacrificially, as Jesus did, faithful unto the end. All of such capital organization are “one bread and one body”. The breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup show forth that all who do so are one with Christ Jesus, in unity with him as members of his body and therefore in the temple.

<p><span class="font5">What came to pass at Mount Sinai was typical. It foreshadowed a shaking which is a searching judgment process upon those who have covenanted to do God’s will and which takes place at the time Christ Jesus sits in judgment as a refiner, and at which time there is a great shake-up amongst the creatures who have made a consecration to do God's will. In this shaking some are cast away, while others are retained. Just such a shaking process began about 1918 and has progressed from and after that date, which marks the Lord’s coming to the temple and the beginning of judgment and the progress of his judgment. At the time of this shaking the lawless ones are gathered out and cast away, which casting-away work is done by the Lord acting by and through his angels.

<p><span class="font5">Sprinkling the book with the blood shows that the laws and commandments of God set forth in his Word, the Bible, are now living and in force and effect toward the remnant, his witnesses, and that they must obey his commandments delivered by the Greater Moses. The blood sprinkled upon the people would prove that one must first be in the covenant of sacrifice in order to receive the privileges and benefits of the new covenant. Those, such as Paul, who died faithful prior tp the Lord’s coming, actually shed their blood in death, but they must wait until the Lord's appearing at the temple to receive the crown of life, at which time the new covenant is inaugurated.

<p><span class="font5">Those brought into the temple and toward whom the new covenant was inaugurated have been anointed; which means that they are commissioned to do a specific service to the name Jehovah; as it is written: ‘<sup>1</sup> The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach.” Concerning this anointed company Jehovah says: ‘‘But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah.” Prior thereto, particularly during the humiliating conditions that existed from 1917 to 1919, God’s people on earth suffered much shame; but his anger being turned away from them, now he says: “For your shame ye shall have double [a double portion of the spirit or divine favor, such as received by Elisha], and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion; therefore in their land they shall possess the double.”—Verse 7. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah had selected the Israelites as his people to go into Canaan. Now the all-important thing to them was faithful obedience to the voice of Jehovah. This proves that those taken into the kingdom covenant must be obedient to the commandments of the Greater Moses and that obedience is better than sacrifice. Jehovah condescends to assure those in the covenant of his own faithfulness Faithfulness is required of all those taken into the covenant. Therefore those in the kingdom covenant are admonished: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” Those who are in the covenant for the kingdom are righteous or just by virtue of being in Christ and having received the robe of righteousness, and “the just shall live by his faith” and faithfulness.—Hab. 2 : 4. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In due time Jehovah directed Christ Jesus, the Greater Elijah, to do a preparatory work, to prepare a people who would see and appreciate the kingdom. In doing this work the Lord used the consecrated who engaged in an ambassadorial or witness work, which had to do with restoring the truth to the followers of Christ Jesus. This preparatory work had to be done before Jehovah’s Messenger came to the temple. It was not a preparing of a people for heaven, even though the ones maintaining their integrity and continuing faithful find their final reward in heaven. The work is preparing the people for Jehovah’s name, which people must do a specific witness work after being taken out of the world and prepared.

He is Jehovah’s official executioner and delivers justice by repaying like with like upon the bloodguilty. He will certainly meet or overtake all of the bloodguilty ones at Armageddon in the battle of the great day of God Almighty and will slay all such as are not in the cities of refuge. The provision of God’s law was, “that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.” (Num. 35:12) All other manslayers must be executed. The cities of refuge were prepared as a way of escape. The antitypical cities of refuge are now set up. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/34</span></p>

By the Lord’s grace they remain true and faithful to Jehovah, and he saves them. The enemy attempts to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, and may succeed in killing the organism of some, but God permits such to come upon his people now to test their integrity, and his promised protection is to those who remain faithful to him. His Word makes it sure that he will have some of the remnant on earth at the final show-down and, though some may be killed by Satan’s crowd, the remnant as a class will survive and persist.

<p><span class="font5">That question required Daniel to identify himself as a Jew, that is, one of Jehovah’s people who gives praise to Jehovah’s name and who was at that time in Satan’s world, Babylon, but not a part thereof. Correspondingly, in A.D. 1931, Jehovah caused his faithful people to come up before the world rulers and to boldly confess to their identity, that is, that they are those who give praise and service to Jehovah and therefore they are true Judeans. Representatively, in a body, they accepted Jehovah’s gracious gift, to wit, the new name which he had revealed to them, and from that time forward they have been known as Jehovah’s witnesses. The clergy’s miserable failure to tell the people the truth makes it necessary for God to employ the remnant. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/34</span></p>

Many men and women have consecrated their lives to God and have, contrary to his will, mixed up with the world, reasoning that they could do so and at the same time serve God and uplift the world; but such a course does not result in uplifting the world and does no honor to Jehovah. Doubtless the “sons of God” were induced to reason along the same line; thus they were entrapped. The “prisoner” class now reason that they can disregard God’s Word and stay in the religious systems, and thus serve God and man.

<p><span class="font5">Egypt depended upon the waters of the Nile as a means of carrying on her commerce. Turning the waters into blood represented death. Satan claimed that he had made the river Nile for himself, meaning that this was his possession. (Ezek. 29:1-3) The people of the world, and many who have consecrated themselves to the Lord, have been induced heretofore to believe that commerce is vitally and essentially necessary to sustain mankind’s life. In recent years God’s covenant people have come to learn that commerce was organized and has been carried on by Satan as a means of controlling the people and turning them away from Jehovah God. This sign or wonder was performed before the Israelites, and thus showed that God’s covenant people must first learn the meaning of commerce and that it is the institution of Satan, and then they must declare the same before the rulers and the people.

<p><span class="font5">The shaking that took place at Mount Sinai at the inauguration of the law covenant foreshadowed the shaking, sifting and refining that take place at the time the new covenant is inaugurated by the Greater Moses. The apostle Paul here compares the responsibility of those in the new covenant with those in the law covenant. The Jews refused to hear and obey the words spoken by Moses, and they did not escape thereafter. Says the apostle: “Much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.” Now Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, speaks from heaven from the temple, and those in the new covenant who do not obey him shall certainly not escape punishment.—Acts 3: 23.

They will remain true to Jehovah and his kingdom regardless of consequences that might come upon them at the enemy’s hands. Like faithful ones of old they now say concerning Jehovah and his organization: “If I forget thee, 0 Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.” Regardless of opposition and persecution they will continue to worship Almighty God as he has commanded them in the same way that Jesus and his faithful apostles did aforetime, to wit, by publicly going from house to house and preaching the gospel.—Acts 20: 20.

<p><span class="font5">The judgment song of Moses at the making of the covenant in Moab puts forward Jehovah’s name and shows that it must be published abroad by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. Jehovah delivered his captive people in 1919 from Satan’s organization. This was foreshadowed by the Moab covenant. God’s covenant people had been scattered, ill-used, and caused to cease from their work, and this was done at the hands of the enemy. Jehovah did not deliver them for his remnant’s sake, but for his own name’s sake, to forestall the enemy’s reproach against that holy name. As it is written : “I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men; were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge amiss, lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, and Jehovah hath not done all this.”—Deut. 32:26,27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.

Their wrongdoing consisted in leaving their assigned duties in God’s organization and marrying daughters of men and thus devoting themselves to that which was in disobedience of God’s law concerning them. They did not heed Noah’s preaching, and when the flood came they found there was no protection for them regardless of whether or not they desired to return to God’s organization at that time. After the flood came, which taught these disobedient spirits the supreme power of Jehovah and showed the vindication of his word and name, such spirit creatures would be restrained (imprisoned) by Satan and his wicked allies to prevent them from breaking away. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/34</span></p>

Hence its failure made it necessary to make a new covenant in place and stead of the old, that God might have a people for his name. &quot;For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with them [Jews], he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant.” (Heb. 8: 7, 8) Neither the old law covenant nor the new covenant is made for the purpose of saving men. The purpose is to gather together a people for Jehovah’s name. The faithful ones thereof he promises shall have part in vindicating his name, the which proves his side of the controversy.

The frogs here particularly represent the agitators amongst the common people who suggest divers and numerous remedies for the world’s salvation. The authoritative exercise by Jehovah’s servants of the divine power and commission in delivering the message of notice and warning to the enemy organization exposes these many so-called “remedies” for the human race.

He turns away ungodliness “from Jacob”, that is, from the people taken out for Jehovah’s name, and it is then that all spiritual Israel are delivered, being gathered unto God as a people for himself. In 1918 Christ Jesus, “the messenger of the covenant,” suddenly appeared at the temple of Jehovah for judgment and purged the “sons of Levi”, which resulted in turning away of ungodliness from Jacob, that is, God's covenant people. This means the taking away of ungodly things, as formalism, creature worship, etc., from the remnant and permitting them to see and to appreciate Jehovah’s purpose. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/34</span></p>

(Heb 9:19) Water well represents the truth concerning Jehovah’s name and purpose, both of which have been revealed to the remnant since the Lord’s coming to the temple. The wool, being of royal or Kingdom color and being of a sheep or lamb, refers to the royal Lamb of God who mediates and inaugurates the new covenant in his own blood. He, the Greater Moses, is now upon his throne and reigns. Hyssop symbolizes cleansing of the “sons of Levi’’ at the temple by a mediator, and at the inauguration of the new covenant.

Then follows the shaking among those who were once in line for the kingdom. This latter shaking is for the express purpose of removing every one in line for the kingdom who is not proved faithful. The apostle declares that ‘those which cannot be shaken’ are the faithful ones whom God has perfected and has taken out and placed in commission, and who continue as his witnesses, and who participate in the vindication of his name.

The divine rule is not subject to change. Jehovah has commanded his anointed to go and bear testimony to the people by telling them the truth that Jehovah is God and Satan’s organization is God’s enemy and shall soon be destroyed. To obey Jehovah’s law the faithful anointed cannot hide themselves by declining to openly testify to his name. They must not cease to bear the kingdom fruits before men and to pray for the increase of his kingdom interests and for destruction of Satan's rule.

<p><span class="font5">The turning of the water into blood foreshadowed a message of truth being declared in the presence of Satan’s visible agents, as well as to the invisible part of his organization. The fulfilment of the prophetic picture began at the convention of God’s people at Columbus in July 1924, when public declaration was made that the commercial giants, the principal ones of this world’s ecclesiastical systems, constitute the chief rulers or representatives of Satan on earth that dominate and oppress the people. This testimony continually given since then by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Scriptural proof submitted in support thereof, has constituted and continues to constitute a great plague upon the organization of Satan. His visible representatives have no answer to these pointed truths, and hence are tormented by hearing them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus is the offspring and seed of the Abrahamic covenant, which takes precedence over both the law covenant and the new covenant. A mediator’s being provided for the new covenant shows that the purpose of the covenant is to bring others into it to act with Christ Jesus and under his direct supervision. The new covenant was made more than two thousand years after the Abrahamic covenant, yet it could not take the place of the Abrahamic covenant, the seed of which is the means of blessing all families of earth. The new covenant is not a covenant of blessing or giving of life; it is a means of providing a people to bear testimony to Jehovah’s name, and who may have a part in its vindication. The mere fact of providing a mediator shows that others would be joined with Christ in vindicating God’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/34</span></p>

Hence the apostle, addressing those toward whom the new covenant is now inaugurated, and to whom these kingdom interests are committed, says: “Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably.” They must have grace and gracious words upon their lips, serving God with pureness of heart.

<p><span class="font5">Darius began reigning as world ruler at the fall of Babylon, picturing the fall of Satan’s organization. He there pictures Jehovah, the First Ruler in the great universal kingdom. Cyrus, the second ruler, pictures Jehovah's “heir of all things”, Christ Jesus. He is the One whom Jehovah associates with himself in the destruction of Satan’s organization. At Babylon’s fall Darius the Mede, rather than Cyrus, is made foremost, which would seem to say that as the result of the battle of Armageddon Jehovah the great King, who is the Supreme One, is made known to all creation that lives, and that his name is fully vindicated, and he is seen to be above every creature.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 31:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of entering into the covenant by sacrifice, each one agreed to obey God’s will or command. This fact must be kept constantly before the attention of his people. This is made sure and mandatory by the Lord’s words spoken in Moab. (Deut. 6:6-9) The covenant made in Moab required that the terms and rules thereof must be read publicly to the Israelites in the place (organization) chosen by Jehovah. Thus is foretold the necessity that the rules concerning the covenant for the kingdom be kept constantly before God’s people that they may learn the requirements thereof. ‘ ‘ Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. ’ ’—Heb. 2:1.

<p><span class="font5">This restoration work was not a work of restoring or setting up God’s kingdom, but a restoring to the faithful of that which had once existed and which had been lost, to wit, the truths of and concerning the kingdom. In the time of that preparatory work the false doctrines of the trinity and eternal torment were completely taken away and it was seen that there is but one true and almighty God and one Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus, who is the King. But the great revelation of prophecy, not being a restoration work, is given to God’s people after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and after the gathering of the faithful ones to h</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ims</span><span class="font5">elf at the temple.

He has laid upon his witnesses at the present time an obligation concerning this class who desire to do right. That obligation cannot be side-stepped or ignored. That obligation is to carry to people of good will the kingdom message informing them of God’s provision made for those who seek to know and to serve him.

<p><span class="font5">It is true that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to conform to the political religions promulgated and practiced by the earthly, worldly leaders, and hence they do not bow down to the “image of gold”. Unwilling to compromise with the Devil, and to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name, God’s faithful remnant hate the Devil’s gilded organization, represented by the golden image, because God hates it. Jehovah’s witnesses are for God and his kingdom, and gladly say: “Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. I hate and abhor lying; but thy law do I love.” (Ps. 119:128,163) Satan’s powers, including his visible agents, reproach Jehovah’s name.

Obedience to the terms of the covenant would prove the qualification of the man to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name when the time should arrive for the issue to be finally settled. Jesus, because of his faithfulness in keeping God’slaw, and proving his obedience under suffering, thereby demonstrated his qualification to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name.

(Mal. 3:3) Following that cleansing work there comes great refreshing to the cleansed ones. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The dying of the frogs does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses stopped proclaiming the message of truth, because Jehovah commands them to continue their work; but it does seem to say that the reasonable people begin to see that the worldly croakers have no real means of bringing blessings to the people and they cease giving heed to them. The message of God’s kingdom published in 1928 specially pointed out that all attempts of government by agitation and agitators must fail because only God’s kingdom under Christ can bring what is the desire of the people. The message of truth therefore angers Satan’s organization, the members of which harden their hearts.

<p><span class="font5">Not every one who is begotten of the holy spirit is a minister of the new covenant, but only those who are brought to the point of maturity in Christ, which constitutes them elders in fact, not by the election of men, but by the spirit of the Lord. Not until brethren in the church who seek to lead should become elders in fact, that is, come to unity in the spirit, could they become the able ministers of the new covenant. Wherever those in the church follow human leaders and ignore the Word of the Lord trouble is certain to result.

Since the primary purpose of the new covenant is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and the covenant is Jehovah’s instrument to gather out an approved people to bear testimony to his name, it follows that the new covenant must be inaugurated or dedicated before the vindication of Jehovah’s name takes place at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured . . . to deliver him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 6:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This illustrates Jehovah’s displeasure with those who make and enforce laws upon the pretext of protecting the people but the real purpose of which is to cause Jehovah’s witnesses to be brought into difficulties and to suffer injustice. In setting his heart on Daniel to deliver him Darius illustrates how Jehovah provides means for his witnesses to present their cases before worldly courts to the end that his witnesses may give their testimony and, if released from custody and from penalties of misapplied law, may be free to continue as witnesses in giving the kingdom testimony until their work is completed. It is surely not his will that his witnesses make no effort to defend themselves before courts. Such is an occasion to testify to Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">Having taken his stand on the Lord’s side and learning of God’s gracious provision for those of the Jonadab class, such cannot turn again to the beggarly elements of Satan’s organization and at the same time have the Lord’s protection. Those who have once sought and found refuge on the Lord’s side and who turn again to unrighteousness will die justly. Jehovah’s executioner is entirely justified in slaying such, and his hands are clean, because he carries out Jehovah’s orders. No one in the universe can ever justly say the slaughter at Armageddon will be barbarous, unjustified or unrighteous. On the contrary, it will meet the requirements of God’s law concerning the sacredness of human life. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, . . . And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him.—Gen. 6:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hebrew word here for “repented” is also translated “be comforted, receive comfort, comfort, ease (oneself)”. “Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies. ’ ’ (Isa. 1: 24) Jehovah himself being wholly devoted to righteousness, it grieved him at heart that man had taken the wicked course; hence God’s heart needed to be eased or comforted and would receive it, not from what some creature might do, but from his own course of action toward those who had brought reproach upon his name. His decision was to avenge or vindicate his name, and this he would do by the destruction of those who had united with Satan’s organization and had willfully reproached his name. W P/I/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be subject to principalities and powers.—Titus 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1929 the Lord made clearly to appear to his people who constitute “the higher powers”. Since then they have been enabled to see clearly that the faithful ones must obey Jehovah and Christ Jesus, who are “the higher powers”, and make no compromise with the wicked organization ruling the world and not ordained of God. Jehovah’s witnesses have no inclination to violate any law of the land, and will not do so when that law is in harmony with God’s law; but they will be guided by God's law and obey his law and trust wholly in him, regardless of results. For this reason the clergy persistently accuse Jehovah’s witnesses before the political ruling powers of the world. The Devil expects now to use pressure on Jehovah’s witnesses to cause them to forsake the path of integrity and thus to make it appear that any creature that serves Jehovah is prompted by selfishness or what the creature may get out of it from God. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1J34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “seven times” of the Gentiles ended in 1914, and, like Belshazzar, the visible rulers of the world failed to then learn the vital truth that Jehovah is God, although they had been told of it time and again. Had they learned this great and all-important truth they would not have held a modern “feast”, which present-day world carousal was foreshadowed by Belshazzar’s feast. God sets up what the world considers the “basest [or lowest] of men”, that is, Christ, who abased himself, and whom Jehovah has exalted even as he had caused to be foretold by his prophets. In 1931 Jehovah God by his witnesses brought this great fact to the attention of the rulers of this world, but they failed to give heed thereto or to learn any part of such great and important truths. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name.—2 Sam. 7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The redemption and deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt’s oppression was merely incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Likewise the redemption and deliverance of the human race, and particularly of the church, are things incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Such redemption and deliverance are, however, proof that Jehovah has the right of the great question at issue. By bringing nine plagues upon Egypt before the destruction of her firstborn and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army Jehovah furnished ample opportunity for Pharaoh to yield to his demands and let his people go or to harden his heart and suffer destruction. Even so in connection with the antitypical fulfilment of those plagues Jehovah gives warning notice to Satan’s organization now. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/34</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye might have life through his name.—John 20:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salvation is through Christ Jesus. Jehovah first makes him his vindicator, establishes his kingdom, and then brings the people to a knowledge of the truth in order that they, under the Kingdom, may receive life everlasting if obedient. If the law covenant with Israel could not give life (which it could not), neither can the new covenant with spiritual Israel, because the new covenant is a substitute for the old. Life is given only to those who have faith in Jesus Christ and continue faithful. The purpose of the new covenant therefore is to gather out unto God a people that will maintain integrity toward God while suffering reproach and contradiction, and who become his witnesses and who, then continuing faithful, have a part in the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.—Rom. 11:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Spiritual Israel had sinned and stood guilty of iniquity before God. God was displeased with them. Such condition existed at the time Christ Jesus came to the temple for judgment. Then it was that God forgave their sins and turned his anger away from them. (Isa. 12:1) Christ Jesus, the judge with all power and authority, had now come to the temple, and he sits in judgment so as to purge the “sons of Levi ’ ’ and cleanse them from their sins, in order that those sons of God might offer an acceptable sacrifice unto God, that is, from that time onward. (Mal. 3:3) The acceptable sacrifice here is that these people taken out for the name of Jehovah must become Jehovah’s witnesses and, in order to be pleasing to God, must thereafter offer the sacrifice of praise to Jehovah continually, that is to say, the fruit of their lips. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/34</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.—Heb. 9:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and half thereof he sprinkled on the altar. (Ex. 24:6) This foreshadowed that at the inauguration of the new covenant the appropriate time and opportunity had come for God’s approved ones to offer an offering in righteousness, that is, the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to his name, the altar being the basis on which such sacrifice must be offered. Sprinkling the blood on the altar signified that it was sanctified for offering such sacrifices and that the time had come to make such sacrifice. Thus the ceremony inaugurating the law covenant corresponds with that inaugurating the new covenant. Then Moses read to the people what was written in the book of the covenant which God had given him. Even so the Lord Jesus Christ does at the inauguration of the new covenant.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our God is a consuming fire.—Heb. 12:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of the inauguration of the new covenant there are those in line for the kingdom but who refuse to hear and obey the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Priest, Prophet and Mediator of the new covenant. Toward these God is a consuming fire. Jehovah, having separated his own and selected them as a people for his name, will sustain those who continue to faithfully maintain their integrity toward him. Hence they have occasion to fear God, but have no occasion to fear what man or the Devil and his angels may do to them. They know that they have not the strength or sufficiency of themselves, but that their strength and protection come from the Lord. “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.’’ (2 Cor. 3:5) By his grace, as his witnesses they can do all things for which they are anointed and commissioned.

<p><span class="font5">At the time of the Lord’s coming to the temple for judgment, and the inauguration of the new covenant, there was a company of his faithful followers who were foreshadowed or pictured by the faithful Naomi. Others came to a knowledge of the truth and were brought into the covenant after 1919. These latter ones seem to be foreshadowed by the &quot;eunuchs” who were brought into the house of the Lord, and well pictured by Ruth. Jehovah says: &quot;I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.” (Vs. 5) This refers to the new name which he gives to those toward whom the new covenant is inaugurated and who are made members of the royal house and who become Jehovah’s witnesses to bear testimony to his name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant.—Deut. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every covenant in the making of which two or more parties are involved there must be a good and valuable consideration moving from one to the other. The faithful performance of the terms and provisions of the covenant constitutes a good and valuable consideration of one to the other. Jehovah by the terms of his covenant binds himself to keep and perform the same. Those on the other side of the covenant are likewise bound to keep and perform the terms thereof. Jehovah is always faithful, and the other parties to the covenant must be faithful if they would please God and be used to accomplish his purposes. It is by Jehovah’s faithfulness and the faithfulness of those whom he takes into the kingdom covenant that his name will be vindicated. Throughout Deuteronomy the pervading counsel is faithful devotion to Jehovah. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The remnant in the kingdom covenant are of the &quot;chosen” ones of Jehovah. In times past they were not a people, but, now being taken out and anointed, they are Jehovah’s people for his name. The selection of these and their induction into the kingdom covenant is not due to self-righteousness or so-called &quot;character development”, but is due to Jehovah’s faithfulness to his covenant, and for the vindication of his word and name. They are taken out for his name’s sake and are approved because of their faithfulness and obedience. Failure of God’s professed people who have been called and who fail must be received as a warning, so that &quot;let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall”.—1 Cor. 10:12,13.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things.—Acts 3:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Peter then quotes from the words of Deuteronomy 18:15 and directly connects the same with the &quot;times of restitution”. Thus he identifies Jesus Christ alone as the one foreshadowed by Moses. In the days of Abraham Jehovah had set up his typical kingdom by placing Melchizedek, &quot;priest of the most high God,” upon his throne. That typical kingdom passed away, and hundreds of years thereafter Jehovah through Moses made a covenant with his people in Moab, which covenant foreshadowed the covenant later made with Jesus for the kingdom. That covenant made in Moab shows that it was Jehovah’s purpose to revive or restore the kingdom of God, which he had set up under Melchizedek; it definitely lays down instructions concerning a future </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g and kingdom. —Deut. 17:14-20. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the duty of the antitypical Levites, from whom God’s royal priesthood is taken, to give information, aid and comfort to those who now seek the Lord’s organization, the antitypical cities of refuge. Therefore those who refuse or fail to go among the people and call upon them at their homes and give them the Lord’s life-giving kingdom message, and those who hinder, oppose and discourage those thus obeying the Lord in carrying the message of truth to the people, show an unloving and unjust spirit that would hand over the Jonadab class without mercy to be executed by God’s Executioner at Armageddon. Failure or refusal to assume and carry out this responsibility will not go unnoticed by the Lord, because he has enlightened his anointed and they must obey.

The construction of the ark was a powerful form of preaching or bearing testimony; but Noah would also explain to those people about him why he was building the ark, and thus he would bear testimony by word of mouth. Therefore the human family and the “sons of God’’ who were married to daughters of men, as well as their offspring, would thus receive Noah’s testimony.

It is the handwriting on the wall. The rulers, though being informed, refuse to repent and to cease interfering with Jehovah's witnesses in carrying the message of truth to the people.

The lice symbolically represent that which results from the message of truth delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses and which greatly annoys, plagues and nips the unclean organization of Satan, and particularly the official members thereof.

His suffering was not necessary in order that the ransom price might be provided, but that the name of Jehovah might be vindicated.

As we approach now to the day of Armageddon, and hence to the time of the most severe test upon the remnant, let those who are privileged to be in the covenant for the kingdom with Christ Jesus rejoice to be permitted to fill up the sufferings that are left behind for the present time, knowing this, that Jehovah will cause all things to work together for good to those whom he has called to the kingdom and who really love him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/34</span></p>

Worldly lawyers look at the technicalities involved. Jehovah’s witnesses have but one purpose, and that is to magnify Jehovah’s name, and hence they see and present the real issue.

Such continue to manifest the spirit of selfishness and lawlessness, insisting on doing things their own way and ignoring organization directions. Hence disturbances follow.

Those toward whom the new covenant was inaugurated at the Lord’s coming to the temple and who were therefore brought into the temple and anointed, were made able ministers of the covenant to minister to those who should afterwards be brought into the covenant, to wit, the class foreshadowed by Ruth.

Jehovah’s witnesses must prepare the way before those who may desire to seek refuge. &quot;Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.&quot; (Deut. 19:3) This provision concerning the city of refuge exactly harmonizes with the Lord’s commandment, which is addressed to the remnant: “Go through the gates: prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway.”—Isa. 62:10.

<p><span class="font5">Their “principality” was the place where Jehovah had assigned them in his organization under Lucifer. They did not give up their spirit bodies but still have them, although at times they may clothe themselves with human bodies. This they must have done when they appeared as nephilim or giants in the earth in Noah’s time. “Their own habitation” means the place to which they were originally assigned in Jehovah’s organization and which they left when they joined Satan in the rebellion. The “great day” means the great day of God Almighty, the battle of Armageddon. It is the day of their execution under the terms of the judgment long ago written against them, which execution will be an exhibition of Jehovah’s power and a vindication of his name.

This does not mean that God has to fast or refrain from pleasure, but here it evidently means that when man has a serious task to perform he should see to it that he conserves his faculties and uses them to the very best advantage. Darius showed genuine interest in Daniel’s welfare. Jehovah has a deep interest in all those whom he has anointed to be his witnesses. When they are passing through some strenuous ordeal that entails upon them suffering and puts them in great danger Jehovah is watching over them with an eye that never sleeps.

By reason of Moses’ faith and faithfulness to God Jehovah chose him as mediator of the law covenant that he afterwards made in Egypt. The Greater Moses was chosen as the mediator of the new covenant, and this selection was made after Jesus was baptized and following his temptation in the wilderness. It was then that he became surety (pledge) and mediator of the new covenant later to be made. The law covenant was made at the slaying of the paschal lamb in Egypt.

By his prophet Jeremiah Jehovah made known what he would do about the old covenant when it was fully decayed and what he would do concerning a new covenant. ‘‘The days,” mentioned by the prophet, began on the passover day of A.D. 33. Jesus had celebrated for the last time the passover instituted in Egypt, and immediately thereafter set up a memorial of his own death; and at that time the new covenant was made.

<p><span class="font5">At this stage of the church anyone meeting with a company of the Lord’s people who refuses to abide by organization instructions, and insists on being lawless and following his own selfish way, furnishes proof that he is not in the temple. The proper course for the remnant under such circumstances is to avoid all controversies and continue to do faithfully what they are commissioned to do. It is better to suffer wrong in silence and to go straight forward in the work which the faithful are commissioned to do than to try to justify oneself or defend oneself. (1 Cor. 6:7) Every one in the temple will have confidence in every other member of the temple company and will be diligent to put aside all selfishness and do the work committed to them with gladness of heart.

Hence she well pictured both the eunuch and the stranger mentioned in Isaiah 56: 2-7. Those pictured by Ruth, and who are brought into the new covenant after 1918, become able ministers thereof and participate in this ministry.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah took Abraham into the land of Canaan and there used him to picture God himself, and Abraham s •wife to picture God’s organization, and their son Isaac to picture the promised Seed, whom God would use as his vindicator. Abraham’s offering Isaac as a sacrifice foreshadowed that God would permit his beloved Son to be put to death at the hands of Satan and that Jehovah would demonstrate his supreme power and the vindication of his name by raising his Son out of death. That was a triumph to Jehovah and a vindication of his name. God provided that the death of his beloved Son should furnish the ransom price for man; but that goodness and loving-kindness toward mankind is secondary to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. All who do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey him, and who receive life, will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name and his word.

<p><span class="font5">All the prophets have &quot;foretold of these days’’, to wit, of the restitution of the kingdom as God’s instrument to vindicate his name; and the most important of all is the vindication of his name. The &quot;restitution of all things’’ means the restitution of God’s kingdom, which existed once in miniature, which had fallen down, and which is now set up in completion with Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, Priest and King on the throne. Immediately following the statement of &quot;restitution of all things” the apostle quotes from the prophecy of Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and definitely shows that Christ Jesus is the Greater Moses and that every one whom he gathers unto himself must now wholly obey God’s Executive Officer. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/31</span></p>

He must continue to appreciate the certainty and nearness of Armageddon, at which time Satan’s organization will be destroyed, and also that soon God’s priestly company shall pass from the earth, and that then the Jonadab class may receive the gift of life through Jesus Christ if they continue steadfast on the side of the Lord and righteousness.

They know that Jehovah is all-powerful and that his purpose is certain to be accomplished. To be sure, they do not know what individuals amongst God’s remnant are going through Armageddon, but they are sure, from his Word, that some of the remnant will pass through and thereafter perform some service on earth in the name of Jehovah.

They must be wholly and completely devoted to righteousness. They must be and remain at peace with each other and walk in unity and in peace. They must have absolute faith in God, make him their fear, and abide in his sanctuary regardless of what devils beset them and assault them. They must have an intelligent understanding of God’s purpose, and for that reason must continue to feed upon the Word of truth, which Jehovah now reveals to them. They must at all times wield the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God’’. All this they must have and do now in order to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah.

According to Scripture, “Baalzebub” means “lord of the flitting one; the side-stepper; the great transgressor”, that is, Satan himself. This term would apply to all who willingly act according to Satan's will. The whole world, or antitypical Egypt, lies under Satan the wicked one. The world has been terribly pestered by these flies, that is, Satan and his numerous invisible and visible agents, since the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918. The Lord Jesus appearing there in 1918 gathered unto himself the faithful and anointed them and sent them forth with his message of truth to be given as a testimony, which message has been and is a great pest to Satan’s organization on earth.

Because of his covenant by sacrifice, which sacrifice was holy and acceptable to God, Jesus is made the mediator of the new covenant. “The blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God, . . . And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament.” (Heb. 9:14,15) The church of Christ does not form any part of the mediator. Christ Jesus alone is the mediator of the new covenant.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are now in a tight place and must watch, and the Lord watches with them. There is unity of all in God’s organization. Jehovah and Jesus Christ are one with those of the remnant, and hence all at the temple are one with Them, that is to say, all are deeply interested in the outcome of the test now upon the anointed. During this time of great danger the entire company of the remnant as representatives of the King of eternity keep themselves in an attitude of prayer and sober thoughtfulness lest they miss some opportunity of doing honor to the name of the Most High. The hour of great testing is upon Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus they pray that they may at the opportune time open their mouths boldly and make known the purposes of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">The covenant made in Egypt was made upon the sacrifice of a literal lamb with a human mediator. The terms of that covenant were afterwards written on stone tables and on parchment. The new covenant is different and will accomplish what the old covenant failed to accomplish. The nation of Israel had proved unfaithful to the law covenant, and therefore unworthy that the new covenant be made with them. Abraham’s concubine Hagar had failed to bring forth unto him a seed acceptable to Jehovah; so likewise the typical covenant organization of Israel failed to bring forth a whole nation or people for Jehovah’s name. Hence the new covenant is “not according to the covenant” made in Egypt. IK 4/</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">15/34</span></p>

Mount Sinai, the place of the inauguration of the law covenant, pictured Mount Zion, God’s organization, to which his people are gathered and where the new covenant is inaugurated. Now Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, teaches the remnant on earth who are members of his house, and they, that is, the faithful ones, ‘see their Teachers,’ learn the truth from them, and rejoice. Jehovah spoke to Moses and directed him as mediator to speak to the people, and Jehovah commanded what they should do “in all places where I record my name”. (Ex. 20:24) This shows that the purpose of the covenant looked to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/34</span></p>

Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” (Isa. 66: 7, 8) These other children constitute a people for Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">Before the making of the covenant in Moab the issue of the name and supremacy of Jehovah was not perceived. Likewise before the building up of Zion and taking the remnant into the temple God's selected people did not perceive the great issue. When the King had come to his throne, in 1914, and the faithful remnant were gathered unto him at the temple, they perceived for the first time the great issue of Jehovah's name, and thereafter they are known as the Lord’s willing ones in the day of his power: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning.” (Ps. 110: 3) Fear of that great and terrible name is necessary to continued faithfulness.—Deut. 28: 58. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/34</span></p>

Jesus’ resurrection from death, his exaltation, and the giving to him of a name above all creation, and Jehovah’s declaration that every knee shall bow to him and every tongue confess his name, to the glory of God, is proof that the primary purpose of the Abrahamic covenant is to show that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God, the Giver of every good and perfect gift.

<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah by Moses made the covenant of faithfulness in Moab, he told the Israelites that he would choose for them a ‘king from amongst their brethren’. (Deut. 17: 15) Later the promise was confined to the house of David and David was put upon the throne as king. Later that typical royal house (tabernacle) fell down. Then by his prophet (Amos 9:11) Jehovah said: “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.” The words “in that day” refer to the day of Jehovah beginning with 1914, when he sent Jesus forth to rule.

<p><span class="font5">Why is one in danger of death who has placed himself on the Lord’s side and who then departs therefrom and returns to Satan’s organization! Because he has learned that Jehovah alone can give life and will give it to man through Christ Jesus, and that there is no other way of getting life; and having learned these good things, he must show his appreciation thereof by faithfully abiding with the Lord and serving him. Such ones do not come within the provisions of God’s new covenant, and life cannot be granted to them till the last member of the priestly class has finished his earthly course. “Death of the high priest” means the change of the last members of God’s royal priesthood from human to spirit organism, which follows Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In all probability some of God’s remnant will be killed by the enemy at and during Armageddon. Hence Satan would think God cannot deliver them. These things do not deter the faithful remnant in performing their duty aa the Lord commands. Immediate deliverance from the fiery furnace of persecution and strife would not answer the Devil’s false charge, but their holding fast their integrity toward God and trusting him implicitly come what may, even unto a tormenting death, will answer that false and wicked challenge that Satan has hurled into Jehovah’s face. Sueh faithfulness by Jehovah’s witnesses is an exhibition of devotion to principle and shows that these are not moved by passion.

(1 Pet. 3:16) Jehovah’s witnesses must go contrary to the world, showing forth the praises of Jehovah, and thus doing they are looked upon as and called evildoers. They must be preachers by word of mouth and by their consistent course of action.

It was not seen in his day, but is seen at the inauguration of the new covenant. During the period of waiting for the appearing of such glory, and seeing we have such hope, says the apostle, &quot;we use great boldness of speech.” (2?.P.)

<p><span class="font5">The city of refuge does not violate the divine decree of justice. Those who now exercise faith in the blood of Jesus and devote themselves to God as an evidence of their faith, but who are not accepted as a part of Christ’s sacrifice, find refuge in God’s organization until the time arrives for Christ’s shed blood to make full satisfaction for the sins these have committed and the blessings of life begin. The responsibility of the manslayer who slew unwittingly does not cease during the time he abides in the city of refuge, God’s organization. Being compelled to wait there until the high priest’s death shows he is a fugitive and his protection depends upon his abiding with the High Priest, Christ Jesus, but that the innocent blood of the High Priest shed for mankind’s sins atones for the sins of the one who has found refuge in God’s organization.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Lord, becamest their God.—1 Chron. 17:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah set the stage in Egypt to make a picture showing forth his purpose to vindicate his name. His gathering to himself and separating to himself a people is not merely to save them, but that he might have a people for his name. His salvation of them depends upon their obedience in performing the duties assigned to them. Before he would bring forth the ‘Seed of promise’ Jehovah pictured how he would take out a people for his name; this he did with the covenant made in Egypt and ratified at Sinai. The imperfect and sinful nation of Israel could not be a people wholly for Jehovah’s name until the promised Seed came; therefore the law covenant was added “because of transgressions [that is, imperfection and sin], till the seed [Christ Jesus] should come to whom the promise was made”. (Gal. 3:17,19) He must come before a people could be taken out for God’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/34</span></p>

Such is God’s will in order to afford an opportunity for them to maintain their integrity toward him. God does not send the suffering, but the faithful ones, suffering for righteousness and for doing right, prove their integrity. Suffering was not required of Christ Jesus to provide the ransom price. In maintaining his integrity toward God he suffered injustice to be heaped upon him. He suffered and remained faithful to God, and thus proved himself entirely faithful. Because of his faithfulness Jehovah raised him up out of death. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Borrowing articles from the Egyptians was not merely for self-adornment, but for use in the Lord’s service by the Israelites. This seems to mean that it is right and proper now for Jehovah’s witnesses to apply for and use any and all of the facilities that the worldly rulers now control and to use them in order for the furthering of the witness work for the kingdom. Borrowing from the Egyptians would also include receiving money by Jehovah’s witnesses in the way of contribution for literature distributed, and then using that money to prepare and publish more literature.

What men? The men, that is, human creatures, who have exercised faith in Christ Jesus and agreed to do God’s will. Why should God appoint a mediator in behalf of men who defame his name and the name of Jesus Christ? The text shows that the apostle was addressing Timothy, and hence others of like precious faith. It follows, therefore, that the word “men” does not refer to all men of the world but does refer to those who have made a covenant to do the will of God; and concerning all such it is the will of God that they be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of the truth; and for all such there is a mediator in the covenant with God.

<p><span class="font5">To obscure the shining in his face Moses put on a veil. The Jews gloried in a man, one of their own blood relation; hence they did not see that the glory of Moses as mediator and inaugurator of the law covenant was temporary, which glory ended when the covenant ended. The purpose of the glory upon Moses’ face was to foretell in a miniature way the coming glory of the greater mediator, Christ Jesus, the inaugurator of the better covenant. But the Jews did not look in that direction, or to that “end”; hence they rejected Christ when he came, and do still reject him. The veil over Moses’ shining face correspondingly shows that Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great priest, veils the truth from the eyes of those that oppose God’s Word at the present time.

Thirty years thereafter by that miraculous power Jesus Christ was brought forth as the antitypical Isaac, the 'seed of promise’. Approximately 1900 years later, to wit, 1914, the “man child” (God’s kingdom under Christ) was born of God’s woman or organization, and'this also by Jehovah’s miraculous power.

(Vss. 29-32) They must not commit adultery; and adultery of spiritual Israelites means chiefly illicit relationship with Satan’s organization. There must be none of this with God’s people. They are not even to touch the unclean thing, Satan’s organization, nor to compromise with the world, but must be wholly for God and for his kingdom. (Deut. 22:13-30; 7:1-5) They shall not depend upon worldly help, but must lend the truth to all who desire it. They must maintain their integrity toward God, which will be tested by their consistent praise to Jehovah or by reproach upon his holy name.-Deut. 15: 6; 29: 24-28.

Not until the bringing of God's remnant into the temple was the truth revealed to them that Christ Jesus alone is that great Prophet. The preeminence of Jehovah’s prophet is foretold in the words recorded in Deuteronomy 34; 10-12 in connection with the covenant made in Moab. Therefore those to whom the Greater Moses is sent are under far greater responsibility than natural Israel was ever under. The remnant, now being informed of the great issue that is to be settled, and being in the kingdom covenant, see that there can be no compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, but that they must be unreservedly and absolutely devoted to and obedient to Jehovah and his great Prophet.

<p><span class="font5">Then the apostle James quoted from the prophet Amos. This prophecy of Amos must be fulfilled at some time, and the tabernacle of David must be build-ed up. But before the building of that tabernacle and the completion of Jehovah’s capital organization, he declares his purpose to take out from the nations a people for his name, which people so taken out must be witnesses to his name. When these are taken out, then he would set up his kingdom, that is, set up Zion as his dwelling-place, and he would build the tabernacle of David which had fallen down.

(Num. 35:31) Innocent blood wrongfully spilled, whether by the unwitting slayer or by the deliberate murderer, pollutes the land. There is but one way of cleansing it. Money or other bloodless ransom price will avail nothing. Blood must literally flow at Armageddon to wash away the defiling which now stains the whole earth. Christ’s blood does not atone for deliberate breaking of God’s everlasting covenant unless the one breaking it fully repents, exercises faith in Jesus’ shed blood by full consecration to do Jehovah’s will, and commits himself wholly to God and his service.

After his resurrection to life as a spirit creature divine, and between that and the time of his ascension into heaven, a period of forty days elapsed. He appeared in a human organism several times to his brethren, but only for a few minutes on each occasion. The Scriptures are silent as to where he was during the other part of that forty days. There seems to be no reason why he might not have gone to the “land of Magog’’ and there addressed a message directly to the spirit creatures restrained in prison that had sinned in Noah’s day and that have since been held in prison by Satan.

Such a severe test increases the creature’s faith and brings greater glory to Jehovah manifesting his supreme power.

In this he repre* sented Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Vindicator, who wars against and throws down creatures that oppose Jeno* vah and reproach his holy name. At this point Gideon .more particularly represents the faithful remnant, for the reason that they, and not Christ Jesus, needed to be assured that Jehovah was with them. To Gideon the angel said: “Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.” And now the faithful ones on earth gathered unto the Lord have from him this message * “I am with you, saith Jehovah.” (Hag. 1:13, A.ZZ.V.)

There* after the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, as Jehovah’s instrument began to unfold to the remnant the mean* ing of prophecy, and it becomes a matter of choice for them to choose between Jehovah’s great Prophet or the Devil’s mouthpiece and representative. Many who think they represent God are in fact Satan’s instruments. As many of the natural Israelites became unfaithful, even so now there are those in line for the kingdom who become unfaithful, and these fail to give heed to the Greater Prophet.

Being at unity, they will have confidence one in another and seek always tp do good one to the other. They shall no longer do ‘ ‘ every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes ’ but observe order and proceed with the work assigned to them, offering their sacrifice of praise to God. (Deut. 12: 8-14) Let all of the remnant now beware lest they fail because of headiness or desire to follow their own ideas as to how God’s work should be done.

That expressed purpose first states that God will select a seed, and by and through that seed ‘all families of the earth shall be blessed'. That declared purpose of Jehovah, which is called the Abra-hamic covehant, is the only covenant pertaining to the blessing of the people, and that covenant is not made with any creature. It is the unconditional promise of Jehovah, made doubly sure and binding by his word and oath, when he says: “By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah.” What did Jehovah swear that he would do? Bring forth a seed that shall possess the gate of his enemies, and that in that seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.

They obey God, and not man, because they are free from bondage of man and manmade organizations ruled by Satan. It is only where the spirit of the Lord is that there is such liberty; and such is the meaning of the apostle’s words at 2 Corinthians 3:17. All those in Christ and in the new covenant, taken out as a people for the name of Jehovah, are, however, bound to be fully and wholly obedient to the great Prophet, Christ Jesus.

Only after Armageddon and after the blood of the antitypieal “goat of the sin offering that is for the people” is applied to the great mercy seat in heaven will the way of justification to life on earth be opened.

<p><span class="font5">On the occasion that Gideon showed faith and confidence in God and when his father Joash took the position he did the name of Gideon was changed, to Jerubbaal, meaning “Let Baal plead for himself”, hence showing that he was a witness against the Devil. The new name clearly implies a witness for Jehovah and against the Devil, and to such witness the Devil has no power to successfully plead. “Let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things! let them bring forth their witnesses.” “There was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.” (Isa. 43:9; 41: 28) Joash’s calling Gideon by a new name strongly suggests the giving of the new name by Jehovah to his faithful witnesses who by reason of being in Christ are part of the Greater Gideon.

Daily they observe the enemy forming wicked devices and striving to bring forth some apparently lawful means of inflicting punishment upon God’s anointed, and they know that at any time they are liable to be thrown to the “lions” of so-called “worldly justice”; but trusting in the Lord they go on in delivering the testimony. They will now stand steadfast in Christ, exercising full confidence that Jehovah in his own time and way will ‘stop the mouths of lions’ in behalf of those who continue to maintain integrity toward him.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah now causes his faithful remnant on earth, his witnesses, to proclaim before the Devil and all of his agents in the world, which constitutes modem Egypt, that the League of Nations, the World Court, the peace schemes, prosperity schemes, and all such like, are not of God, but of the Devil, and that the instigators and supporters thereof are unclean and an abomination in God’s sight, just as King Uzziah was unclean and became leprous for his wrongful acts before Jehovah. Such declaration of truth throughout “Christendom” by means of radio, books, magazines, and word-of-mouth testimony has been and is a great plague to modem Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians blasphemed God’s name because of their pains and sores. Likewise modem Egyptians curse. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15J31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The fleece employed in Gideon’s test pictured the Lord Jesus Christ, “a Lamb as it had been slain.” Dew’s descending upon the fleece would picture the Lord Jesus Christ at 1914 as receiving the joy accompanying his commission from Jehovah to proceed with the work of vindicating His name. The dry ground round about the fleece well pictures Jehovah’s faithful servants, particularly from 1914 to 1918. During that short period those faithful ones alive on earth were trodden down and beaten like a threshing floor. The dew upon the fleece pictured Christ Jesus as receiving his joy, while at the same time the dry ground around the fleece pictured his faithful ones-who had not yet entered into the joy of the Lord.. Christ Jesus was given joy in a copious quantity. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Because of the fear of the Israelites they requested a mediator. ‘ ‘ They said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear.” So likewise upon the coming of the Lord Jesus, the Greater Moses, to the temple and there gathering unto himself the faithful remnant, they must have a mediator, or else they would ‘‘fall into the hands of the living God”, which they would not want to do, because of their imperfection. When the holy spirit ceased to perform the office of helper or comforter and advocate, the Lord Jesus at the temple stands between Jehovah and the remnant and performs the office of mediator and advocate as well as the in-augurator of the new covenant.

<p><span class="font5">Those of the temple company are not changed from the glory of the law covenant to that of the new covenant, but they are changed into the likeness of Christ as faithful witnesses to Jehovah’s name. During the Elijah period of the church the faithful ones in a measure reflected the Lord’s glory, but, being transferred from the Elijah to the Elisha period of the Lord’s work, they have greater honor and glory of service, because the Elisha work is an unselfish devotion to the honor of Jehovah’s name. It is in this day that it becomes more apparent to the Jonadab class as to who are Jehovah’s true witnesses giving honor to his name even as Jesus did when he was on earth. Jesus said: &quot;The glory which thou gavest me I have given them. ” The faithful reflect the Lord’s glory that even those outside may determine who are really unselfishly devoted to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">In Gideon’s first test the dew upon the fleece while the ground about it was dry symbolized Jesus himself entering into the joy of Jehovah. Now Jesus Christ would share his great joy with those faithful standing with him. In the second test the dew was upon the ground and the fleece was dry, picturing that the faithful ones gathered to the temple and anointed of the Lord had entered into the joy of the Lord. Divine approval of the ‘faithful servant’ class was then confirmed upon them by pouring out of God’s spirit upon all such flesh entering into the joy of the Lord Jesus Christ. There the unifying process began in a special way. The dew of joy of dwelling together in unity began to distill upon Christ’s true brethren on earth. —Ps. 133:1, 3.

<p><span class="font5">Those taken into the covenant for the kingdom have now begun to appreciate the truth that there is but one Jehovah God; many others claiming to be God’s children are blind to this great truth. Jehovah’s supremacy is affirmed in the covenant at Moab, and it is to those in the kingdom covenant that this great truth is magnified now. Those who desire to do so may choose another for their god and take the consequences, but the faithful will be wholly devoted to Jehovah God. Jehovah now calls to the would-be gods of the enemy for a final show-down. This truth he caused Moses to speak, and now the time has come to settle the great issue and God’s chosen people must declare his purpose and his judgments.

<p><span class="font5">Let the remnant now rejoice and confidently and patiently march on to Armageddon. Jehovah will gain for himself the victory by his strong right arm, Christ Jesus. Jehovah’s unmatched power to deliver his people at Armageddon will prove his supremacy and that nothing can successfully resist his power. Now it is seen that the crucial test will come just before and at Armageddon. In that test the faithful have the assurance that almighty power will be used in their behalf. Jehovah makes it plain to his people now that the only place of safety is in his organization. Into this he has brought his anointed ones, and now their loyalty and fidelity to him is permitted to be tested, and in his loving-kindness he gives to them advance information concerning their protection and deliverance, that they may remain firm and steadfast on his side during the fiery test.

<p><span class="font5">Until the time of their execution they are confined in “chains of darkness”, not literal chains such as we see with our eyes, but restraint in darkness similar to the state in which the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” is found, having lost the light concerning God’s purpose. This means utter darlmess as to their understanding of Jehovah’s purpose. The holy angels have desired to look into these things, and now having come to the temple with Christ Jesus they are enlightened and permitted to look into them. Not so, however, with the wicked angels. There is no light of God’s favor for them. In the light of God’s face is life; hence “chains of thick darlmess” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott) </span><span class="font5">would clearly imply eventual destruction. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/34</span></p>

The Jona-dab class, by taking their stand on Jehovah’s side and connecting themselves with his organization, have also wrought his judgment or purpose. All these must be meek, that is, teachable, and hence must study God’s Word, which is food convenient for them. All such must seek righteousness,-that is, must be diligent to conform themselves to God’s laws, which are righteous. All who pass through the great tribulation of Armageddon must be hid by Jehovah, otherwise they could not be shielded from that terrible trouble that will come upon the world. That means, then, that all in Jehovah’s organization, including his anointed and all connected therewith, such as pictured by Jonadab, must now 'study to show themselves approved unto God, and be workers’.

<p><span class="font5">This unity reached a climax with the cleansing of the temple, and those who entered into and have remained in the temple have continued in this state of unity in Christ. With this unity and harmonious action God has continued to send his refreshing truths to his people. When God fed his covenant people in the wilderness, first the dew fell upon the camp at night and then manna fell upon it. (Num. 11:9) Even so with the coming of the unity of Christ’s brethren, as pictured by the dew on the dry ground in Gideon’s second test: there fell the heavenly bread of truth which the Lord has revealed and given to his people and which continues to give strength and hope to nil who hold fast faith and confidence with Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The relationship of the law covenant made in Egypt to the covenant of faithfulness made in Moab well foreshadowed the relationship of the new covenant to the covenant for the kingdom, which latter covenant requires absolute faithfulness on the part of those who will ultimately share in the kingdom of Christ Jesus. At the institution of the Memorial Jesus declared to his disciples that the new covenant had been made and he invited them to share in it. Then and thereafter he told them that Jehovah had covenanted with him for a kingdom, and his words to his disciples show that faithfulness is the chief thing required of those brought into the kingdom covenant. The covenant for the kingdom is his preparatory arrangement affording opportunity to those taken into the covenant and who are Jehovah’s witnesses to prove their faithfulness even unto death.

The weighing consumes time, which weighing began when the official Weighmaster, Christ Jesus, appeared at Jehovah’s temple, and continues until the final end, which comes in the great tribulation. During the weighing of Babylon by Christ Jesus the ruling elements, pictured by Belshazzar and his feasters, put on vestments by which they identify themselves as anti-God, anti-Kingdom and Devil-worshipers, hence deserving to be slaughtered at Armageddon. While the weighing progresses Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to commandment, go through '‘ Christendom” and mark those God would save from slaughter. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W11/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There are not several Jehovahs, each having a different will and work. There is but one God. The remnant now see and appreciate their divinely given privilege of proclaiming the name of the one and only true Jehovah God. This they do with great gladness of heart. They worship the one and only true God, and this is the first commandment, first in time and in importance, as Jesus declared. (Mark 12: 29, 30) This first commandment is made a part of the covenant for the kingdom. Jehovah alone must be worshiped, above all else. The people taken out for his name must be 'holiness unto Jehovah’, that is, be wholly devoted to him and not tempt him, nor shall they compromise with the enemy and his organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When the faithful are criticized by others of the company with which they are associated they are not to retaliate by indulging in controversies, but will busy themselves with the Lord’s work. Their joy in the Lord must not be interrupted by indulging in personalities and unfruitful arguments with others. Their joy in having part in vindicating Jehovah’s name has brought forth the faithful anointed, or &quot;young men’’ or 'youths’, on Christ’s side, and they continue in his strength and might. They not only are willing, but delight to go forward in the war for the Lord and the honor of his name. These faithful ones are as fresh as morning dew. &quot;Thy youth are to thee as the dew.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.,</span><span class="font5"> margin) They are as dew among many people who receive refreshing from their efforts to magnify Jehovah’s name.—Mic. 5:7.

<p><span class="font5">This definitely fixes the purpose of the new covenant, to wit, to prepare a people for Jehovah’s name, who must be witnesses to his name to deliver their testimony before the destruction of Satan’s organization. Jehovah visits Gentiles as well as Jews and takes out a people for his name, which people must bear testimony after they are taken into the new covenant and made qualified witnesses for Jehovah. He makes known how he will prepare this people; and this work is done after they are begotten of the spirit and come under the new covenant terms, to be prepared as his instruments to be used by Jehovah. When one is taken into God’s organization he desires the truth in his mind and heart, in his inward parts. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Had the original 32,000 of Gideon’s army gone into action and won the battle they would have been little disposed to give credit therefor to Jehovah their Deliverer and Savior. This shows that anyone’s having a part merely in the service is not the chief and important thing, but that vindication of Jehovah’s name is of paramount importance. Jehovah will get the vic-toiy for himself, and that to his own honor and glory. His witnesses must do their work in the strength and to the glory of God. Jehovah does not need men to fight on his side, but he gives his faithful remnant an opportunity to be his witnesses and to maintain their integrity toward him and to have a part in the battle of the great day.

In due time the freewoman gave birth to the typical seed, Isaac. This was the result of the exercise of Jehovah’s miraculous power. This birth was a confirmation of his covenant with Abraham. Isaac was a type of Christ Jesus, the Son of Jehovah. At the time of Jesus’ baptism the voice from heaven was heard to say, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” There the real, true seed promised in the Abrahamic covenant was brought forth.

This could not foreshadow that before Armageddon God’s remnant would be taken out of danger. Not until Satan and all his organization are destroyed will all danger be removed. Daniel was just as safe inside as outside of the lions’ den, because he had the protection of Jehovah’s angel. His being taken out seems to picture that there would be a series of acts of deliverance by Jehovah of members of his anointed remnant that they might continue to serve as his witnesses.

<p><span class="font5">In Moab Jehovah made a covenant with his chosen people who had been brought out of Egypt forty years previously. That covenant, recorded in Deuteronomy, foreshadowed the covenant for the kingdom. Jesus, made of a woman and under the law, was not a son of the law, but was and is the Son of God. He kept the terms of the covenant made at Moab, and Jehovah made him the great Prophet, whom Moses foreshadowed. Showing the relation between the covenant made in Moab and the kingdom covenant, when Jesus was ^&gt;ut to the test by Satan he quoted from God’s words recorded by Moses in Deuteronomy. On other occasions he quoted the words of the prophecy in Deuteronomy. When he spoke the words concerning the gathering of God’s elect he clearly had in mind Moses' words recorded in Deuteronomy 30:4.—Matthew 24; 31.

Therefore when the face of the spiritual Israelite is turned to the Lord, and hence away from man, the veil is taken away and the vision of the unveiled face is had by those who are with Christ in full unity. This explains why those at the temple have a clear vision pf the Lord’s purpose and his glory at this time and others who think they are in Christ have no vision at all. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/34</span></p>

The ones that stand today with the Greater Gideon are they that are “called and chosen”; it is the “remnant whom the Lord shall call”.

Because Jehovah of hosts is their fear and their sure protector.

No one could ever have occasion to regret his faithful devotion to God. Men who today rule in &quot;Christendom’’ and who have joined in conspiracy against Jehovah and his anointed and have attempted their destruction must be cast to the lions of divine justice, and this God will do in his due time.

It will mean that Satan has failed in his design to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. The Lord Jesus was there in the furnace with those three faithful Hebrews and, by the grace of Jehovah, giving protection to them.

<p><span class="font5">This seems to symbolically say that this message of notice and warning given by divine command pertains to heavenly things, which became totally dark to those making up the visible part of Satan’s organization, and particularly those who form the religious or so-called “spiritual” elements of Satan’s organization. In 1919 the League of Nations was set up as a substitute for God’s kingdom, and which league the clergy hailed as 'the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’. In 1926 Jehovah’s witnesses made public a declaration at the earthly seat of the beastly power of Satan. This set forth that the League of Nations is the child of the Devil and wholly in opposition to God’s kingdom. The rulers of “Christendom” continued to scoff, and from that time thick darkness has settled down on “Christendom”. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/34</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.—1 John 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is nothing inconsistent in Jesus' being mediator for the church and also advocate for the church, both of which positions he does actually fill. Does not a mediator advocate for one who needs help? Moses was mediator of the law covenant, and he advocated for the Israelites who had sinned, when he prayed to God to forgive them. (Ex. 32: 29-32) Likewise Christ Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant is the advocate of those in God’s organization who sin. Prior to the Lord’s coming to the temple the holy spirit is designated in the Scriptures as a paraclete, comforter, or advocate or helper. Since the coming of the Lord to the temple the office of the holy spirit as advocate has ceased, but that does not affect the fact that Christ Jesus at Mount Zion both mediates and advocates.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shdlt thou set by himself . . , And the number of them that lapped . . . were three hundred men.—Judg. 7:5,6,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three hundred lapped the water, &quot;putting their hand to their mouth,” and hence used their arms, illustrating the God-given power to convey to themselves refreshing waters of truth by those who ‘with joy draw water out of the wells of salvation’. (Isa. 12: 3) The three hundred kept on the march as they scooped up the water in the hollow of the hand and transmitted it to the mouth. This foreshadowed alertness and watchfulness on the part of Jehovah’s remnant, who clearly discern the enemy and are not at all in ignorance of his devices. (2 Cor. 2:11) They receive the truth in the manner that calls for praise of Jehovah. The choice of them by the Lord shows that they drink water for the fight.

<p><span class="font5">Before the day of their execution Jehovah informs Satan and his wicked angels that they are to be executed. He uses his witnesses now on earth to give that testimony. This witness or testimony began particularly in 1928, when the Lord's angel began pouring out his “vial” upon the “air”. From that time forward there went forth the declaration against Satan and his organization and in favor of Jehovah and his organization. This is a fitting time for Jehovah to make his faithful witnesses, the remnant, a “spectacle” or “theatre” both for men and for angels. Their testimony by word of mouth and by faithfulness to God and his organization under the most severe test is a true demonstration of Jehovah’s purpose to preserve the faithful and to destroy the wicked. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/34</span></p>

All such are spiritually minded and have a vision, while others are blinded. The faithful look into the unveiled face of the Lord Jesus as though looking into a mirror.

Jehovah gives his glory to Christ Jesus, and to his temple company, and to none other. (Isa. 42:8) Christ Jesus reflects the glory of Jehovah, and those in the temple, beholding his glory, reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus to others, that they may see who are the true witnesses of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/34</span></p>

It is these faithful ones that are with the Greater Gideon and that will he with him at the battle of Armageddon.

It means that a courageous man is one who unhesitatingly goes forward in the face of great danger and relies not upon his own strength but confidently relies upon the power that is backing him up in his forward movement. Gideon and his men were entirely unequal to the enemy in numbers and actual strength; hence they must and did rely upon the supreme strength of Jehovah God and showed complete faith in God when obeying his commandments.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah now gives his elect servant “for a covenant of the people’’. He does not make a covenant </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font5"> the people. A covenant does not have to be made with creatures, but may be a one-sided or unilateral covenant. A covenant is a binding promise, agreement or expression of purpose to do or not to do a certain thing. God’s word of promise to bring forth a seed in which all families of the earth should be blessed constitutes a covenant of Jehovah, a binding agreement or declaration to bless the human race. Then, when the seed is brought forth and the kingdom is set up and Jehovah’s name is vindicated, Jehovah will give his elect servant, Christ, “for a covenant of the people.” That means that Christ will stand as a guarantee to the people that God’s purpose long ago announced will he faithfully carried out. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/34</span></p>

All who survive Armageddon will look with awe and reverence and devotion upon God and his great King, even as those who stood with Nebuchadnezzar no doubt looked with astonishment upon the three Hebrews brought forth from the furnace. (Vs. 27) Jehovah’s three faithful Hebrew witnesses, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, represented those who will be seen rejoicing. In the day of fiery trials Jehovah’s witnesses faithfully perform their service and rejoice therein; and now, at the end of Armageddon, Christ Jesus calls them forth and acknowledges them before his Father even as he promised. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These wicked ones are constantly under surveillance of the holy angels acting under the Lord’s direction, which surveillance, however, would not prevent the wicked ones from associating and operating with Satan in heaven, where they were when Satan was cast out of heaven by the Lord. At that same time these angels were cast down to the earth with Satan. They operate with Satan in his organization now to bring woe upon the world, and this they are doing. They are yet very much alive.

Jehovah is not rushing his remnant to the battle before they are made strong and courageous in the Lord. For some time prior to the battle God causes his remnant to be instructed as to the meaning of his prophetic pictures long ago made and which he caused to be made for that very purpose. He has builded up his people in faitli, love and unity, and they are “strengthened by his spirit in the inner man”.

This was first publicly declared at an assembly of Jehovah’s people in Detroit, Michigan. It was then that the lightnings flashed from the temple and the remnant had their first clear vision of the great issue joined between Satan and Jehovah.

Not everyone who makes a covenant by sacrifice proves faithful; hence not everyone who makes a covenant by sacrifice is embraced within the class that is ‘the people taken out for his name’ Only the faithful ones are the saints of God.

His law in the heart of his saints reveals to them the divine commission bestowed upon them to proclaim the message of his kingdom. It is to such that the testimony of Jesus Christ is committed, and it is these that faithfully keep God’s commandments and thereby prove their love for him.

Gideon, hurrying back to his little army, gave the command, “Arise.” That was a bold expression of faith in God. With stronger reasoning should the remnant today say to each other: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The conflict or war in which Jehovah’s witnesses engage is not with human creatures, that is, with flesh and blood. We were once led to believe that this was their fight, and that they must develop a perfect character to get to heaven. But that is not their real fight. It is with Satan and a host of wicked spirits operating with him since the time of the rebellion. These unseen wicked hosts use as their dupes or agents men, who are on earth and who willingly or unwillingly do the bidding of the unseen wicked powers. Why is that wicked crowd making war on Jehovah’s witnesses? Because such are in God's organization and engage in delivering the message of truth Satan and his crowd do not want people to hear. Such truth pronounces the doom of Satan and his organization. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At Armageddon the world's rulership will be snatched bway from Satan and taken over by Christ Jesus. In verse 25, “u-Pharsin” (the plural of “P’res”) calls attention to two dividings, the dealing out of Babylon to Christ in 1914, when the Devil was cast out of heaven, and the second dealing out, which takes place at Armageddon, when Satan’s organization is destroyed and ruling the world is taken over by Christ. The ‘dividing of the kingdom’ seems to support the conclusion that there are two divisions of the conquering forces, to wit, the unseen and the seen. The Medes symbolize the invisible organization of the Lord God, including cherubim, seraphim and angels. The Persians would picture Jehovah’s anointed ones on earth, members of The Christ, to wit, the remnant. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God's anointed remnant on earth are of the priestly order, and his law required that the priest must teach Jehovah’s law to the people. Therefore there is an obligation laid upon the remnant, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, to study and inform themselves and also to aid and teach those of the Jonadab class to understand the truth. An obligation is laid upon the Jonadab company to inform themselves by studying the Word of God, because they must continue to seek meekness, that is, to be teachable and be taught, and they must continue to seek righteousness, that is to say, to learn of and walk in the way God has appointed for them. Such are the conditions precedent to receiving his protection in the time of great tribulation. They must perform these conditions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s anointed people are moving up to the greatest conflict of all time. It behooves them to be cautious and use sagacity and the wisdom that is given to them from on high. The three companies of Gideon’s army did not picture three branches of God’s service, because the three companies constituted one body; but there are three sections of Satan’s visible organization to be attacked, to wit, religion, commerce, and politicians. God put it into the minds of his people to declare what constitutes Satan’s organization and to serve notice upon each branch thereof and to make public declaration of the same, that the people of good will who desire to hear may hear and learn and then take an intelligent course. Jehovah directs his own work, though we hear no audible voices. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That decree seems clearly to foreshadow the first decree of the new heaven following Armageddon. The remnant being still on earth at that time, the Lord’s decree will necessarily bring them prominently before the people as the faithful servants of the Most High God and of Christ, who maintained integrity toward Jehovah under the most trying conditions. The battle of the great day will itself be a decree, because it will be a royal expression causing all creation of earth to tremble and fear before Jehovah. Then they shall know that Jehovah is God. The survivors will see that Jehovah has extended his favor to those faithful witnesses whom he has brought through the great tribulation, and will rejoice. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/34</span></p>

All who follow the lead of Satan and his wicked allies will die at Armageddon. The present time, when the Lord Jesus at the temple is causing the proclamation of the truth to be made, and particularly the judgment of Jehovah concerning the destruction of these wicked ones, must be to them a time of real torment.

Today we are able to look on our invisible Leader, Christ Jesus, and do as he did, as described by the prophets in the Scriptures, and our work must be done as he directs. He instructs the remnant what they must do. Let each one look well to his own course and see that he is obeying instructions given to him by the Greater Gideon. If the other fellow fails to obey, that is his great misfortune. Render all the help possible, when help is desired, but do not try to keep someone else in line who does not wish to stay in line.

Therefore they must be faithful witnesses of Jehovah, because they have been with Jesus and learned of him and must do as he does; they must be bold in bearing the testimony to the name of Jehovah. Thus their course of action is changed from what it was during the Elijah period, and they become like the Lord, as bold and fearless witnesses. This does not mean to be rude witnesses, but to calmly and fearlessly tell the truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/34</span></p>

Likewise the world rulers now make some concessions to those who serve Jehovah God, but this upon conditions that would make Jehovah’s witnesses go empty-handed before the Lord and be deprived of all means of offering the “continual sacrifice” of praise before Jehovah. God’s faithful witnesses will not comply with any sueh condition, but they will obey Jehovah and not man or devil; and their attitude angers Satan’s representatives and calls down upon the heads of Jehovah’s witnesses the expression of wickedness and threats of destruction.

<p><span class="font5">In the Abrahamic covenant Abraham stood for Jehovah God himself; hence what is called the Abrahamic eovenant is the expression of God’s purpose, and that without conditions attached, to bring forth a seed through which all families of earth may be blessed. Jehovah bound that declaration by his oath, and, by reason of both his word and his oath this promise or covenant is immutable. (Heb. 6:18) Abraham was the father, or life-giver, of Isaac, who typified the seed, God’s Son. God’s woman is not his covenant, but she stands for God’s organization. Christ Jesus, the seed of promise, is the seed of God.

The Jonadab class are of those who 'hear’ the message of truth and who must say to those in their hearing; &quot;Come.” Mark that Jehu invited Jonadab to “eome with me, and see my zeal for the Lord”. Jonadab was there as one to learn, and not one who was to teach. He saw that Jehu had and manifested </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">burning love and devotion or zeal for Jehovah’s cause. From that he learned that he too must have a zeal for the Lord, that is, he must serve Jehovah because it is right to serve him, and not merely to selfishly receive blessings at Jehovah’s hands. Jehovah's official organization on earth consists of his anointed remnant; and the Jonadabs who walk with the anointed are to be taught, but not be leaders.

It made the name of Almighty God the issue, and victory must result, otherwise Jehovah’s name would suffer reproach. Today the name of Jehovah is a strong tower for his people. The time has come when that name must be proclaimed throughout earth, and that just before He exhibits his almighty power against the enemy organization. The faithful remnant must tell this message, because God has set this time for it to be done.

The destruction of the world in Noah’s day by the flood foreshadowed the destruction of the present world at Armageddon.

At the direction of God Noah built the ark, which served as a place of safety and preservation of Noah and those associated with him. That foreshadowed that the only place of safety during the greatest tribulation of all time is to be found in Jehovah’s organization. The ark which Noah built at the command of God is therefore a picture of Jehovah’s organization, and symbolically says to all intelligent creatures: “Jehovah’s organization is the only place of safety.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/34</span></p>

To the rulers and their supporters of this wicked world under Satan the temple of God is a place of darkness, because none of them can see therein. The rulers have been served with notice of warning, and now the remnant, the witnesses of Jehovah, will do what they can for the people of good will that they may hear the Lord’s message and take their stand.

Jehovah’s kingdom and righteous rule under Christ shall endure, and “his dominion shall be even unto the end”. That means that his supremacy and sovereign rule shall continue.

That was not taking any of the glory away from Jehovah, but was merely showing by what authority Gideon was acting. Likewise today the name of Christ Jesus must be published as Jehovah’s King. He is invisible to the enemy because he is a spirit. The shout must now be given that Christ Jesus is at one with the Most High and is Jehovah’s executive officer, the One whose name hypocritical religious organizations have taken but whom at his coming they have rejected, and that thereafter he will bring about complete destruction of the enemy.

By thus doing they are not asking permission of Satan’s organization to do something, but they are serving notice upon Satan’s organisation and demanding that this worldly organization ehall cease interfering with the execution of God’s ^purposes.

They are not to pass upon the guilt or innocence of any individual, but are to declare the law or rules of Jehovah’s judgment, which apply to the obedient and the disobedient.

Therefore let all of God’s organization dwell together and walk together in peace and harmony. Let all strife and fault-finding be put aside. Those who indulge in fault-finding and murmuring and strife will be adversely judged by the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Egypt’s firstborn would picture all of Satan’s children, that is, those of his earthly organization who are the chief of their strength, to wit, leaders and chief ones in the religious, commercial and political branches of his visible organization. The firstborn of every portion of Satan’s organization were destroyedj which anti typically includes the &quot;man of sin”, the &quot;strong-arm squad” and those who put forth their strength to carry forward Satan’s schemes. In this day Satan makes war upon the remnant of Jehovah and would destroy them. The only protection these faithful witnesses have is from the Lord, and this eomes by reason of their obedience to Jehovah’s commandment given to them by the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus.—Acts 3:23. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/34.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna.—Judg. 8:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gideon was nearest of kin to his slain brothers, and hence the duty devolved upon him to slay these murderers. In this he pictures Christ Jesus as the avenger Of blood fulfilling the obligation laid upon him by Jehovah, and this in answer to the cry of those who have been slain as a testimony to God’s Word. (Rev. 6:10) &quot;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.” (Luke 18:7,8) This is in exact harmony with the prayer the remnant by divine command now pray concerning the enemy: &quot;Do unto them as unto the Mid-ianites; . . . Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb; yea, all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna.”—Ps. 83: 9,11,12. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daniel from, the power of the lions.—Dan. 6:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To his faithful witnesses Jehovah has revealed the two great signs, the organization of Satan and the organization of Jehovah, and at Armageddon God will proveto all that these “signs” are true. He has worked “signs and wonders” in earth by using his faithful remnant, and in due time also these will be confirmed as true. Daniel’s rescue from the lions’ den foretold the rescue and delivery of the remnant from the cruel and unrighteous law, and from the ravages that will come upon the earth during Armageddon. Their being on earth after destruction of the wicked at Armageddon will prove they are on earth only by the power and grace of Almighty God, and this will be a vindication of his name and power. All creation then must acknowledge that Jehovah is God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Jer. 31:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah says to those in the covenant, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font5">. . . will be their God,” he must mean that no false rulers will be tolerated; therefore there must not be practiced the ceremony of giving honor and glory and worship to creatures, because such is as the “sin of Samaria”. All formalities performed for show must be put away. Honor and glory must be given to Jehovah, to whom honor and glory is due. (Ps. 96: 8) It is now easy to be seen by those in the temple that the work of writing God’s law in the hearts of his people and in their inward parts has been the very work he has been doing in them in preparing them to be his witnesses; and this is proof that the new covenant applies exclusively to spiritual Israel. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/34</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our sufficiency is of God: who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament.—2 Cor. 3:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For what purpose are these made “able ministers of the new [covenant] ”! Manifestly for the purpose, as stated by the same apostle in another place, to wit, “for the perfecting of the saints, . . . till we all come in the unity of the faith.” (Eph. 4:11-13) Such is the work of ‘taking out a people for his name’, which work the new covenant accomplishes. The ministry of Paul to the church proved him to be such an able minister to the new covenant. No consecrated and spirit-begotten child of God could be counted an able minister of the new covenant, however, until he has attained maturity in Christ, that is to say, has become an elder in fact, and not by mere election of fellow creatures. When all are brought to unity in Christ all such are elders in fact. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s witness Noah, the “preacher of righteousness”, foreshadowed God’s faithful remnant now on the earth. Those persons with Noah in the ark foreshadowed the Jonadab company now on the earth who associate themselves with God’s organization. These have the promise that, performing the conditions named, they may be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger. The conditions are that they attach themselves to the Lord’s organization, and they must remain there steadfastly serving God, working in harmony with Jehovah’s witnesses, and refusing to compromise with the world. Any attempt to remain in the organization or “chariot” of the Lord and at the same time to support the wicked world, even with the unwise desire of lifting up the world, will meet with disaster. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus has appeared at the temple and gathered Jehovah’s saints unto himself. Here Christ Jesus instructs the temple company, and sends them forth to reflect his glory. The angels of the Lord have gathered out the lawless ones, and the Lord has clothed the faithful ones with the robe of righteousness, and sends them forth as his witnesses to shine by reflecting his glory; and now are fulfilled his words: &quot;Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” (Matt. 13:43) Only Jehovah s witnesses, made part of the 'elect servant’ class, are given such glory. As the faithful witnesses of Jehovah these maintain their integrity toward him, and because they do so the reproaches which fell upon Christ Jesus fall upon them and they are opposed and persecuted.—Rom. 15: 3.

<p><span class="font5">Gideon could not accept the office of ruler at the hand of the people. Nor is Christ Jesus an opportunist who will take advantage of the Armageddon victory and the praise that will follow to accept honor and office from the people. Jehovah God is the King of eternity, and hence the Great Ruler. It was in 1914 that he placed his anointed King upon his throne and sent him forth to rule, his first work being the ousting of the enemy. Vindication must take place before the thousand-year reign of Christ with his saints begins. The all-important thing of the Gideon picture was the driving out of the Midianites, foreshadowing Satan’s organization and its destruction; which was a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Gideon’s refusal foreshadowed Jesus’ faithfulness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the complete fall of Babylon, Satan’s organization, including “Christendom”, the order of the rulers of the world will be, to wit, first, or supreme Ruler, Jehovah; second, Jesus Christ; third, the members of the body of Christ, and hence the “faithful and wise servant” class, whom Daniel foreshadowed. The “handwriting” has now appeared on the wall of “Christendom”; her doom is sealed. It is certain that Satan’s seed, those who now rule the earth, will be destroyed. The Bible does not disclose who slew Belshazzar. It was the agency of Jehovah that did it; hence here is pictured the work of Jehovah’s Executioner, Christ Jesus, enforcing the divine judgment, which is already written against Satan's organization.

<p><span class="font5">In making the covenant in Moab before the crossing of Israel into Canaan Jehovah states his purpose to choose one place for his house or temple and to put his name there. In this Jehovah foretold that, when Zion is builded up and the remnant gathered to the temple under Christ Jesus and Jehovah puts his name there, all sacrifice of praise and service must be done according to the rules of that organization and through his organization, and not according to every man’s own whim or desire. “Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.” (Deut. 12:8) Jehovah’s work must be done according to the rules of his organization.

<p><span class="font5">By his covenant Jehovah God is majestically carrying forward his announced purposes. He has taken out a people for his name, who must now be his witnesses; and, continuing faithful, they soon shall participate in the vindication of his name. But before the battle of the great day of God Almighty it is his expressed will concerning them that they must, under the leadership of Christ Jesus, bring knowledge home to the people of good will, that they may have opportunity to turn their hearts and their devotion to God and his kingdom. The present duty of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses is plain and clear. Performance is not discretionary, but mandatory.

<p><span class="font5">That Gideon was faithful and true to the end is attested by the Scripture record. Now gross darkness is upon most of the inhabitants of earth, but Jehovah has placed in the hands of his witnesses an abundance of light which is being used by the grace and direction of Christ Jesus, the Greater Gideon. The faithful have been brought to the very outposts of the enemy’s camp. They observe the enemy, and what they see assures them that victory will be soon and is certain to crown the Lord’s efforts. They are now ever on the alert, and not only willing, but eager, to obey every commandment of the Lord. Waving torchlights of truth and proclaiming the message of God’s Word they continue with courage to shout their battle-cry: “For Jehovah and His Vindicator.’’ W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s organization is the only place of safety. One who once avails himself of that safety and then voluntarily leaves the same, is certain of destruction. Those who are of the Jonadab company must continue to faithfully study God's purposes as embraced in his Word; hence the publication of the Lord’s Word is for their benefit. They must show their love for God by being diligent in keeping his commandments. Jehovah, the Almighty God, is the Giver of life; he will preserve those who love and obey him and who remain steadfastly faithful to his organization, at all times manifesting unfaltering, unbreakable love for Jehovah. The crucial test upon all intelligent creation is here. Let all such take warning and beware. “Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”—Hab. 2:20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.

The term “Jerusalem” applies generally to Jehovah’s organization, to which organization the Jonadab class have attached themselves. The great Judge, Christ Jesus, is now carrying on his judgment in dividing the people and bringing on his side those who love God and righteousness. God’s remnant or priestly class, in particular, must take the lead in peace, unity and harmonious action. All who accompany them must be at peace one with another and serve the Lord faithfully. “For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

<p><span class="font5">That promotion of the three Hebrews suggests further privileges of service that God will give to his faithful remnant on the earth immediately following Armageddon. That service will, to be sure, be temporary, but it seems reasonable that God would have some service performed on earth by his faithful remnant at the beginning of the reconstruction work in connection with those faithful men of old who shall become the visible governors on earth. It will be a great privilege to personally meet these new governors at that time and have some communion, fellowship and service with them. That will be a happy time. The temple work on earth after Armageddon will be followed by a change of the remnant from human to spirit organism and to the realm of far greater opportunities of service to the Most High.

<p><span class="font5">Those toward whom the new covenant has been inaugurated, and who are therefore in the temple, are the people of God, and the great antitypical David is their Head, King or Ruler. While the &quot;covenant of peace” here is not the new covenant, it is a covenant of peace which Jehovah gives to those toward whom the new covenant has been inaugurated. The enemy will continue to assault them, but such assaults will not cause the faithful to fear either man or devil, nor will the faithful fail to boldly declare God’s message of truth. They will obey God and not man. Their faith and confidence is in Jehovah. They know their strength comes from him; hence they are at great peace, because they know God’s promises are sure, and the enemy shall not prevail against them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/34</span></p>

All the temple class will now continue to give testimony of praise to Jehovah’s name, that all willing ones may know that Jehovah is God. His covenant announcing his expressed purpose to bless all the nations through Christ; Jesus his seed is an everlasting covenant. All of its purposes will be completely performed. He gives his chosen one, the Christ, for a covenant of the people, fully assuring them that if they would receive the blessing of life everlasting in happiness they must know that Jehovah is God and Christ is his High Priest, and they must render complete obedience to Christ to God's glory.

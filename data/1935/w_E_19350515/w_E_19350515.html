<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can. come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SEEKING KNOWLEDGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil.”—Prov. 3: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH rewards those who diligently seek to know his purpose and to obey his conimandments. The faithful remnant apply themselves that they may gain a knowledge of his will in wisdom and spiritual understanding. “Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. They also do no iniquity; they walk in his ways.” (Ps. 119: 2, 3) They study to show themselves approved unto God, and look not to any creature for guidance and strength. “Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust; and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.” (Ps. 40: 4, 16) Those who do not believe that the Lord Jesus is at the temple of Jehovah will find no consolation in these texts. Those who are in the temple and who are diligent to learn will receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> knowledge of Jehovah’s purpose, that they may freely and boldly declare it to others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">* With the beginning of chapter two of the prophecy of Habakkuk we find the prophet waiting upon the Lord God and not leaning to his own imperfect reasoning. He is seeking knowledge concerning the unfolding of God’s purpose. Likewise today the remnant trust in the Lord with all their heart, waiting upon him and diligently seeking his face, that they may be filled with a knowledge of his will in wisdom and spiritual understanding. The prophet Habakkuk, representing the remnant, now says: “I will stand upon my watch [Hebrew, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mishmereth],</span><span class="font5"> and set me upon [fix my foot upon, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay]</span><span class="font5"> the tower </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin: </span><span class="font5">the fenced place], and will watch [look forth, R.V.] to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font5"> when I am argued with].” (Hab. 2: 1) That Habakkuk here pictured God’s anointed witnesses now on earth is corroborated by other scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• The prophet Isaiah also pictures the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, when he says: “I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward [Hebrew, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mishmereth]</span><span class="font5"> whole nights.” (Isa. 21: 8) The approved remnant are not idle ones, sitting down or standing idly by, but are active and on the alert to keep Jehovah’s charge. To the faithful the promise is made: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If thou [the remnant] wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.” (Zech. 3: 7) Such do keep “the charge of my sanctuary” faithfully. (Ezek. 44: 15, 16) The Hebrew </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mishmereth</span><span class="font5"> rendered “watch” in Habakkuk’s prophecy is the same word rendered “ward” in Isaiah’s and “charge” in Ezekiel’s prophecy, and means a watch or sentry. The “tower” mentioned by Habakkuk is a place of divine favor. “Blessed be the Lord; for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font5"> fenced city].” (Ps. 31: 21) The very language of the prophecy and corroborative scriptures shows the application to God’s people in the time of war, when the faithful are under siege and for that reason requiring watchfulness and prayer to Jehovah through Christ Jesus. “For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. ’ ’—Luke 21: 35, 36; 1 Pet. 4: 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The watching of Habakkuk, who there represents the remnant, applies at the time after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and during the period of time Satan is gathering the whole world against the Lord and his anointed. The time is after Satan is cast out of heaven and when he turns over to his prince Gog the work of assembling his forces and forming and executing the conspiracy against God’s hidden ones, and when the wicked forces are seeking the destruction of the anointed of Jehovah. The physical facts show fulfillment of the prophecy definitely fixing the time as that of the present. The earthly agencies of Satan, particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy and other religionists and their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">supporters, acting under the leadership of Gog, are laying siege to the people of Jehovah. Now, if the remnant will understand the questions raised in chapter one of Habakkuk’s prophecy, they must watch and be on the alert at all times. While thus watching, shall the remnant be quiet and inactive? No; but, on the contrary, they must be diligent in declaring the purpose of Jehovah. “Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.” (Ezek. 3: 17) “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.” (Isa. 52: 8) “Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong,” says the apostle. (1 Cor. 16: 13) Speaking of the impending battle of the great day of God Almighty the apostle says to the anointed: “Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.” (1 Thess. 5: 6) “Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watchcth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.”—Rev. 16: 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The second chapter of the prophecy of Habakkuk therefore opens with the faithful remnant on watch: “to see what he [the Lord] will say unto me [speak with me, B.V.],” that is, what the Lord will say to me in reply to the questions propounded at chapter one. Since 1918, and particularly since 1924, the enemy has with increased vigor persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses and defamed Jehovah’s holy name, and Jehovah shows that he will speak and give his reason for permitting the wicked to continue such iniquitous work. The organized opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses increases, and the burdens become greater upon the anointed; and since God has promised that all things shall work together for good to those who love him and who are called according to his purposes, these have every reason to expect to see a good and adequate reason for Jehovah’s permitting such persecution, and hence they inquire in full confidence. “Shew us thy mercy, 0 Lord, and grant us thy salvation. I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.” (Ps. 85: 7, 8) The crucial hour has come, and it is only the Lord who can give complete peace and strength to his people. They get up into the siege tower to see what? Manifestly to see the movement of Jehovah’s host against the doomed “Christendom” and to get a clearer vision and to cry out to those below, and particularly to those of good will known as Jonadabs. The language is symbolic, of course, and the siege tower pictures the remnant uplifted and in a heavenly position. Jehovah speaks to them by his prophecies and thus gives them flashes of lightning, revealing to them what is written in his Word for their comfort and hope.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•Habakkuk, and antitypically the remnant in the watchtower, desire to learn what God will answer to the inquiring ones and their argument. Other translators render this text in this manner: “shall answer concerning my complaint” (Zf.V.); “answer to him who reproveth me” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser,</span><span class="font5"> margin). It is the rulers of this wicked world who challenge the right and freedom and authority of Jehovah’s witnesses to proceed with their witness work. Jehovah does not reprove them, because they are doing his will. The “evil servant” class or “man of sin”, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and such like, reprove the remnant and smite them. The dupes of Satan also charge Jehovah with responsibility for the great oppression now afflicting the world, and thereby do some reproving, which requires the Scriptural answer from the watchman class, that is to say, the faithful remnant. In Germany, Canada and New Jersey, and many other plaees-in “Christendom”, the agents of Gog and Satan increasingly and relentlessly continue to oppose Jehovah’s witnesses and to cruelly ill-treat them. The faithful know that they are right, and they persistently go forward with the witness work; but they have a keen desire to understand just why the enemy is permitted to continue to oppress them. Jehovah provides a place and manner for them to find out the answer. “So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.”—Ps. 119: 42, 43.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Those who worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, and who ask Jehovah in the name of Christ Jesus, will in due time receive an answer to their questions. “And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.” (John 16: 23) We are now “in that day”, and it is the will of God that we should ask in the name of Christ Jesus. Habakkuk did ask; and the remnant, whom Habakkuk represented, now ask the meaning of Jehovah’s prophecy. “And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.” (Hab. 2: 2) When Jehovah answers, that answer always gives satisfaction and strength. ‘ ‘ I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.” (Ps. 138: 2, 3) Now appreciating the fact that the prophecies were written for the aid and comfort of the remnant, they ask with confidence. “Thus saith the Lord, the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it; The Lord is his name: Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. ”—Jcr. 33: 2,3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> It is a condition precedent to asking and receiving that the one making the request be wholly devoted to Jehovah, in Christ Jesus and having God’s Word abiding in him. If a creature is wise in his own conceits and thinks to interpret prophecy by reason of his own mental capacity, such creature is in fact foolish, because he ignores God’s way. As to the hypocritical ciders the Lord says: “Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet [to the anointed of Jehovah], I the Lord will answer him that' cometh according to the multitude of his idols.” (Ezek. 14: 4) It is the meek that Jehovah guides; and the meek are those who make no claim for themselves to be wise and able to interpret the Lord’s prophecy, but who trust wholly in the Lord and diligently seek to learn from him his purpose: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.”—Ps. 25: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> Jehovah directed Habakkuk to write the vision which God gave to him and which pertained to the vindication of Jehovah’s Word and his name. Concerning the same vindication subject Jehovah commanded Isaiah saying: “Take thee a great roll [writing material], and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz [which name means, ‘In making speed to the spoil, he hasteneth the prey’; also, ‘Speedy booty, sudden spoil’].” (Isa. 8:1) Jehovah also commanded Jeremiah, within a short space of time before the fall of Jerusalem, saying “Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah even unto this day.” “Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jchoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.” (Jer. 35: 2, 28) “And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. ” (Jer. 25: 13) Such are the ‘judgments written’ against the Devil and his crowd which now shortly the Lord God will execute. (Ps. 149: 9) As Jehovah gave Habakkuk a vision, even so his promise is to give a vision or understanding to his anointed ones “in that day”. (Joel 2: 1, 28) Jehovah is fulfilling his promise.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah directed Habakkuk to write the vision and make it plain. The clear implication is that when that time arrives for Jehovah’s anointed to understand the vision, it will be made so plain to them that there could be no doubt about it. The writing of the vision given to and written by Habakkuk had no reference to charts made for the purpose of explaining what has been called “the divine plan”. A chart means only that which is in the mind of the one making it and who makes it for the purpose of illustrating some lesson that the maker is attempting to teach. If it should appear that the chart was incorrect, then that would mean that the maker did not have a clear understanding. Now we know that no man can get a clear understanding of God’s purpose until God’s due time. Both the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font5"> render this text: “Make it plain [up]on tablets”; which would be much more permanent than upon paper or parchment. The record must be a permanent one and preserved for the time of the fall of hypocritical “Christendom”. “Now go, write it before them in a table [tablet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.],</span><span class="font5"> and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever. That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord: which say to the seers, See not: and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things: speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.” (Isa. 30: 8-11) The present-day facts show that the prophecy applies now and that the judgments written are leveled against hypocritical “Christendom” in particular.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The vision is not given to be kept secret, but must be told to others and printed and published in plain, readable style. It was after the pouring out of the seventh “plague”, in 1928, that Jehovah began to make clear to his faithful children on earth that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is of paramount importance. “But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.” (Rev. 10: 7) Shortly thereafter, in 1929, the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font5"> was published, in which the Lord revealed to his people the reason why he has permitted evil or wickedness in the earth; that he has not permitted it for the purpose of teaching men the bad effects thereof, but that Satan might have a full opportunity to prove his boastful challenge and that the great question at issue might be settled once and for all. It was then seen for the first time that Satan had challenged Jehovah to put men on earth who would maintain their integrity toward him and that God accepted the challenge and gave Satan a full opportunity to prove his boast. Thus God’s purpose became clearer to the anointed ones. Shortly thereafter the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font5"> was given by the Lord to his people, showing that justification for Jehovah’s permitting evil, and also explaining the organization of Jehovah as set forth in Ezekiel’s vision. These things have been made plain, not by the ability or work of man, but because Jehovah has caused events to come to pass in fulfillment of his prophecies long ago written.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The latter part of Habakkuk 2: 2 is otherwise rendered in this manner: “That one may swiftly read it.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “That every one may read it fluently.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> Manifestly the text means that when the time arrives for the fulfillment of the prophetic vision, those who are really devoted to Jehovah will readily understand it. This would apply, and does apply, not only to the remnant at this time, but to the Jonadab class, who in obedience to God’s commandments seek meekness and righteousness in this day. By studying the prophecy, together with the physical facts well known to them, all the meek may readily see and understand the present-day conditions and know that Armageddon is near. Those who do read and understand are obligated to run with haste and tell others about it. When the vision appears, then it is the privilege of those who see to hasten and give others the opportunity to hear and understand and thus to publish the name of Jehovah. Thus the time is now due to run swiftly and proclaim the message which pertains to the great wickedness now being practiced in the earth, the opposition to Jehovah, and the fact that the time of his vengeance is at hand. “He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.” (Ps. 147: 15) “I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.” (Ps. 119: 32) To “run” means to make haste; and hence the prophecy here indicates that the time is short in which the work must be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The “vision”, which is given to the prophet and now to the remnant, is of the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which battle will be fought for the purpose of vindicating Jehovah’s name; and hence </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">is for a definitely appointed time. “For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” (Hab. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2: </span><span class="font5">3) The fulfillment of the vision is at the time appointed for God to make a short work of the iniquitous ones. (Rom. 9: 28) Immediately preceding that time, that is, between the time of the appearing of Christ Jesus at the temple and the time of the final end of Satan’s organization at Armageddon, such is the time allotted for the preaching of “this gospel of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">kingdom”, which must be done by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses taken out of the world for his name. (Matt. 24: 14, 21) Within that time the rulers must receive notice and the people of good will must receive warning. At the end the vision “shall speak”, that is to say, shall be clearly and forcibly expressed. The vision is made clear to Jehovah’s witnesses before the final end; otherwise there would be no opportunity for them to sound the warning to the people. The text in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> concerning the vision reads: “And it hasteth toward the end.” This further suggests that not only is the time definitely fixed, but the time is short, and that Jehovah’s witnesses must make haste to do the work which the Lord has given them to do. After the warning, which the anointed must give to the people of good will, “then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24: 21; Ezek. 7: 2-6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>M</sup> When God’s due time comes the vision will speak </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in no </span><span class="font5">uncertain terms “and shall not lie”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.) </span><span class="font5">“And will not deceive.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Clearly this means that it will not fail of fulfillment, nor prove to have been merely an imagination of false prophets, and that it will be so plain that all must know that it is an expression of Jehovah’s purpose. The vision is not of peace, but of war, that is to say, the final war. (Ezek. 13: 4-16) It means the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Today there are some who claim to be God’s children and who say that the Scriptures concerning Armageddon are merely figurative, but figures of speech, and that there will be no actual trouble, and certainly not of any unusual magnitude. Be not deceived by such false prophets. Jehovah has put the message in the mouth of the remnant, and the remnant are not of those false prophets, “that prophesy lies in my name.” (Jer. 23: 25-32) The remnant are sure, and not in doubt, concerning the vision, and they must tell the truth. The time of “tribulation” began in 1914, and in 1918 Jehovah shortened the period of tribulation by stopping the World War; and between that time and the final war at Armageddon the opportunity is given for Jehovah’s witnesses to declare his purpose before the final end comes. That witness work has been in progress for some time, and there is much evidence that the final end is near. There was a tarrying or hesitation at 1918, when the World War was stopped, but there will be no tarrying concerning the final combat. “Though it tarry </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Hebrew:</span><span class="font5"> hesitate], wait for it [to be fulfilled] ; because it will surely come [its fulfillment is certain], it will not tarry.” It will not be at all behind time, but will be exactly on schedule and will arrive when the worldly-wise say: ‘Now we have “peace and safety”, because we have signed agreements and compacts for worldly peace.’ (1 Thess. 5:3) The apostle quotes from the prophecy of Habakkuk. (Heb. 10: 36, 37) There is no delay in the fulfillment of the vision; but it is the expressed will of Jehovah that the witness work must be done before Armageddon, and, while doing that work, and until it is done, the faithful remnant must have patience, that is to say, be constant in the performance of duty even under great stress, rejoicing inwardly because they know that they are taking the course which the Lord has pointed out for them and that he is their shield and deliverer. Understanding the vision now adds great strength to the remnant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> When the World War ended, there were those who had once been in line for the kingdom but who became wise in their own conceits and who refused to receive the food which the Lord provided for his people. They said and continue to say that the Lord has not come to his temple, and hence that they will have nothing to do with what is called the witness work. Having this class in mind the prophecy says: “Behold, his soul which is lifted up [puffed up, R.V.] is not upright in him [is not straight in him, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font5"> margin] [Lo! as for the conceited one, crooked is his soul within him, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font5">: but the just shall live by his faith.”—Hab. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The apostle Paul quotes, word for word, the rendering of a part of this text from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Septuagint, </span><span class="font5">to wit: “If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.” (Heb. 10: 38) This shows that the prophecy refers to the “man of sin” or “evil servant” class, who-draw back or revolt, because of self-conceit magnify their own importance, and are not honest and straight, but are crooked towards Jehovah and his King. These are the ones that commit the “sin of Samaria”. Though the vision is made plain by the Lord, these conceited ones refuse to accept it, and not only refuse to run further and tell others but, on the contrary, oppose Jehovah’s witnesses in giving the testimony relative to the vision. They exalt themselves above that which comes from God.—2 Thess. 2: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The “wicked servant” class is here set out plainly in contrast to the faithful remnant, to which this part of the text applies, to wit, * ‘ But the just shall live by his faith.” The just shall live “by his faithfulness”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The just ones arc the ones brought under the robe of righteousness, and do not withdraw from the battle ranks, but delight to obey the commandments of Jehovah given through Christ Jesus. (Isa. 61: 10) The “man of sin” or “evil servant” class draws back to perdition. Concerning the “faithful servant” class, the remnant, the apostle says: “But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that.believe to the saving of the soul.” (Heb. 10: 39) Those-who do continue faithful in their devotion to God shall live; others shall be destroyed. (Ps. 145: 20) Faith, or faithfulness, means that one maintains his integrity towards Jehovah God, refusing to compromise vyitli any part of Satan’s organization, and exercising diligence in learning the will of God and then joyfully obeying his commandments. The faithful remnant gladly feed upon the food Jehovah has graciously provided for them, and they grow in strength, regardless of all persecution that the enemy may heap upon the faithful as they go on in the proclamation of the message concerning Jehovah’s name and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“The elements now ruling “Christendom”, to wit, religion, commerce and politics, are under the direct supervision of Gog, the chief officer of Satan. These visible rulers have became drunken with the wine of Babylon.. Concerning such the prophet Habakkuk wrote: “Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither kcepeth at home, who en-largeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people.” (Hab. 2: 5) The wine of such is the joy of being rulers and exercising power over the people. It is the joy of Satan's organization, that is, the wine of Babylon’s drunkenness. (Rev. 17: 2; 18: 3) This is well illustrated by the “bootleg” liquor used during prohibition, containing more poison than stimulants. The joy of the visible rulers now is their attempt to rule by the thing which they have made to stand in the holy place, where it has no right to stand. (Matt. 24: 15) “Christendom’s” rulers are proud, haughty and arrogant, and, due to the wine of Babylon, they are drunk; and therefore God resists them. That crowd “neither keepeth at home”, cannot mind their own business, but must sally forth and plunder others who are not imperialistic like unto themselves. Gog has formed the conspiracy and leads it, and these ruling elements of the earth have been drawn into his conspiracy and made drunk, and they join in the assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses as foretold by the prophecy of Ezekiel. (Ezek. 38: 10-13) Gog and all of his dupes or coconspirators busy themselves in opposing every one who serves Jehovah God. The remnant, therefore, are to expect nothing else than opposition from such.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The prophecy here shows that this crowd of Satan is not satisfied. Says the prophet: “Who enlargeth his desire as hell.” “His desire,” that is to say, Gog’s and the earthly ruling factors’, is never satisfied with what they have, but they always desire more power and self-gratification. “Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.” (Prov. 27: 20) The rule exercised by such is deathdealing, and the desire is to have power over all, even as death has power over all men. (Rom. 5:12, 14) They are not satisfied or satiated, because they have the ‘lust of the flesh and of the eye, and pride of life’, which proceed from Satan. (1 John 2: 16) The constant effort of such is to gather unto themselves all nations and peoples and to bring them entirely in subjection to the ruling powers. This is the clear and undoubted purpose of the rulers in all the nations of “Christendom” today. They are all moving with imperialistic power; and under the Devil’s chief marshal Gog all are moving forward in warfare against the saints of the Most High. (Rev. 13: 7, 8) That which the prophet Habakkuk long ago described we now plainly see before us. We having an understanding of the vision now, the reason for the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is made plain and the evidence is clear and conclusive that Armageddon is in the near future.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WOES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The prophecy at this point introduces five woes pronounced against Satan’s organization, and particularly against the elements that rule in “Christendom”. These are not the woes that the Devil brings upon the nations and people to turn them away from God, as stated in Revelation 12: 12, but are synonymous with Jehovah’s judgments long ago written against the enemy organization, and which judgments are to be declared by the servants of the Most High. These woes are from Jehovah and which he brings upon Satan’s organization, and which reach a climax at Armageddon. Habakkuk declares them here, and he foreshadowed Jehovah’s witnesses declaring these woes just preceding Armageddon. “Shall not all these take up a parable [a riddle or cryptic speech] against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!”—Hab. 2: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The Devil and his agents always do something to blind the people to the real truth. Today many uncomplimentary statements against Big Business are being made by professional politicians who want to continue and receive the support of their constituency, but such criticisms are in fact a camouflage. The purpose of making such statements is to hold the people in subjection, and this can be done by keeping professional politicians in power. There is also much criticism of the politicians and the religionists made by unbelievers in the earth, but none of these are from Jehovah’s standpoint. Many who continue to speak against the elements of Satan’s organization still tenaciously hold to and permit themselves to be in subjection to that organization. Such, therefore, is not the “taunting proverb” or “riddle” mentioned by the prophet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Who, then, take up the taunting proverb against him and speak the woes ? The taunting proverb is set out in Jehovah’s Word, and it is the faithful ones, Jehovah’s witnesses, that take up and declare this proverb; and which also include the people of good will, who receive the message from the lips and hands of Jehovah’s witnesses and who then join in declaring the truth. Says another prophet: “Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon.” (Isa. 14: 3, 4) Soon God will bring these woes that are pronounced upon Satan’s organization, particularly upon “Christendom”, and it is those who love and serve Jehovah that must and do declare the same immediately preceding Armageddon. Satan’s visible organization has builded strongholds and heaped up great riches, and now uses the same to oppress the poor. (See Zechariah 9:3; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font5"> page 145.) The Midianites did that very same thing against the Israelites in the day of Gideon, and the battle of Gideon that followed foreshadowed the battle of Armageddon. Now Gog is the messenger in chief of imperialism, and the imperialists of “Christendom” who manage it will come to a bitter end. “He that op-presseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.” (Prov. 22: 16) God therefore commands the remnant, his faithful witnesses, to now take up the ‘taunting parable’ and say to the imperialistic rulers and others of the Devil’s organization on earth, “Woe to him!” To whom is this woe pronounced? “His number is six hundred threescore and six.” “It is the number of a man.” (Rev. 13:18) That is the number of an imperfect thing, representing three ruling olerwnts of Satan’s beastly, visible organization, to wit, politics, commerce and religion, that join hands to rule the nations of the earth.—See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 299.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Satan’s organization visible, as all now well know, ‘has increased that which is not his,’ and this has been done particularly since 1914, and each year the burden upon the people has grown greatly. Everybody now knows that the slogan ‘ ‘ The war will make the world safe for democracy ’ ’ was not only a lie but a wicked deceit to blind the people while Satan’s crowd got a further strangle-hold upon the nations. The prophet cries out concerning the first woe, “How long?” that is to say, How long will it continue? The answer is, Not very long now, because the day of the battle of Jehovah draws nigh. Therefore, says the Lord’s witness, ‘be patient, brethren.’ (Jas. 5: 7) In this woe a taunting parable or proverb is directed against “him that ladeth himself with thick clay”; according to other translators: “ladeth himself with pledges” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font5">; “with heavy debts” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5">; “with a burden of guilt.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> The ruling elements of Satan’s visible organization have loaded up with pledges of pawned goods and worthless obligations, in this, that the ruling element has made all sorts of promises to the people and upon the strength of these promises has gained possession of the wealth of the earth and given to the people in return therefor only such things as jobs with the wages of serfs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> The ruling element has gypped the people, who produce the wealth by bestowing labor upon that which God has provided for them, and then the ruling crowd has held back from the honest people that which belongs to them; and thus the ruling element loads itself with burdens or pledges or heavy debts that will never be paid by them, and therefore God will require an accounting by them at the battle of Armageddon. (Jas. 5: 1-6) The course of action taken by the rulers of “Christendom”, particularly since 1914, and all the physical facts, show this fulfillment of the prophecy. “Christendom’s” ruling element has taken a course exactly contrary to God’s law and must suffer execution of the judgment of Jehovah.— Ex. 22: 26; Deut. 24: 6-13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The ‘taunting parable’ leveled against Satan’s visible organization, and particularly against the ruling elements of “Christendom”, continues in these words: “Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?” (Hab. 2:7) This docs not mean a revolt by a despoiled and oppressed people against the ruling elements, because the people are helpless within themselves to accomplish any relief. They that ‘ ‘ rise up suddenly ’ ’ are those who are on the side of Jehovah and who do his service, including the anointed remnant and the Jonadab company. God’s day of recompense comes suddenly or unawares upon “Christendom”, because the rulers in “Christendom ’ ’ have failed to give heed to the warning. (Luke 21: 34, 35) Says Habakkuk: ‘They shall bite thee,’ or, “shall exact usury of thee” (A.R.V., margin) ; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)</span><span class="font5"> “strike (with a sting, as a serpent stings).” This corresponds to the “tails . . . like unto serpents”, with which “they do hurt”, as stated in Revelation 9: 19. (Sec also Revelation 18: 6, 8.) They “rise up suddenly”, that is, suddenly “awake”, “all at once become active.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> They “shall vex thee”; “agitate thee as with fear.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong)</span><span class="font5"> The “seven last plagues”, which are merely reports of the approaching battle of Jehovah, do greatly vex and bother the ruling factors of “Christendom”. (Rev. 16: 17, 19; Isa. 28: 18, 19) At the battle of Armageddon “Christendom” ‘shall be for booties [plunder or spoil] ’ unto the armies of the Lord.—Ps. 68: 12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Why this woe, pronounced by God’s prophet and later declared by his witnesses? The prophet of Jehovah answers: “Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and for the violence of [done to] the land, of the city [to the city, R.P.], and of all [and to all, R.V.] that dwell therein.” (Hab. 2: 8) Satan’s organization has spoiled the nations, and during the World War and since Gog and his earthly agents have particularly attempted to spoil and cut off Jehovah’s remnant taken out of the world as a people for his name, and to thus prevent them from becoming a nation. Now the remnant will see Satan’s organization spoiled by the invisible armies of the Lord God. Benefits also accrue to the Jonadab class, who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and who continue to obey his commandments. These have received the mark in their foreheads and are designated for preservation during the great battle. (2 Ki. 10: 15, 16; Ezek. 9: 1-7; Zeph. 2: 2, 3) Satan’s crowd shall be spoiled and wrecked. “Woe to thee [‘Christendom’, the chief part of Satan’s earthly organization] that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil [ from and after Armageddon], thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. . . . Then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.”—Isa. 33: 1, 23; see also Jer. 50: 10; 2 Chron. 20: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Another reason why ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ shall suffer destruction is “because of men’s blood”, “for shedding human blood.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Christendom” has knowingly and maliciously broken the everlasting covenant by cruelly and needlessly shedding human blood. (Gen. 9: 1-6; Isa. 24: 5) Satan’s woman, that is, his wicked organization, is “drunken with the blood of the saints” and all slain upon the earth, and this wicked crowd shall suffer the vengeance of the Almighty God. (Rev. 17:6; 18:24; 2 Ki. 9:7, 8) Corroborative of this Jehovah’s prophet wrote: “For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants [ruling elements, who hold sway and dominate the people] of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.” (Isa. 26: 21) “Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.”—Deut. 32: 43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Another assigned reason for “Christendom’s” being compelled to suffer this destructive woe is “for the violence done to the land” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.).</span><span class="font5"> “The land” here means particularly God’s people, pictured by the land of Judah. From 1918 to the present time the violence against God’s people has increased. Today in Germany, in Canada, in New Jersey and many other parts of the United States, violence continues against Jehovah’s witnesses. God’s “city” is Zion, that is, his organization, now represented on the earth by his remnant, and because of the violence to Zion Egypt, which is symbolic of the Devil’s visible organization, shall be spoiled. “Egypt [made up of the commercial, political and religious elements that rule the earth] shall be a desolation, and Edom [particularly the traitorous brethren once claiming to be servants of God but now having deserted and joined Satan’s organization] shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah [those who faithfully praise and serve Jehovah], because they [Egypt and Edom] have shed innocent blood in their land.” (Joel 3:19) From the days of the ministry of Jesus on earth to this very day “the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence”. (Matt. 11: 12) The account must be and will be squared at Armageddon. “As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.”— Jer. 51: 49.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND WOE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> “Christendom” is reminded of her wickedness as pronounced in the second woe of the prophecy: “Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font5"> that gaineth an evil gain] to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power [hand] of evil!” (Hab. 2: 9) Extortion is another form of “Christendom’s” wickedness, and which was illustrated by the king Jehoia-kim, forced from the throne eleven years before the fall of Jerusalem. The prophecy here applies specifically to the ruling clement of Satan’s visible organization. For many centuries the visible ruling element have practiced fraud and thereby brought great distress and oppression upon the people. Moved by the covetous desire to have that to which the rulers had no right, they have employed deceit and violence to accomplish their wicked purpose. Concerning them God says: “Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong: that useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; that saith, I will build me a wide house, and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him; was not this to know me? saith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness [thy own gain, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser],</span><span class="font5"> and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence to do it. Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”— Jer. 22: 13-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> The rulers in Israel picture the rulers in ‘ ‘ Christendom”, concerning which God’s prophet wrote: ‘‘Behold, the princes of Israel [rulers in ‘Christendom’], every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God. . . . Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.”—Ezek. 22: 6, 12, 13, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> The words of the prophet here plainly and clearly describe the great wickedness practiced by the ruling elements of “Christendom” against the people. In that cruel, dishonest and covetous effort for greater gain the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been right in the forefront. The wicked influence was but a small part of their cruel campaign for selfish gain, and they have carried on their crookedness in divers and numerous ways in order that a few men might have possession of that to which they had no right. By fraud and oppression that religious crowd robbed the people of Mexico for many years, annually sending to the pope approximately thirty million dollars, and this continued until the better element of Mexico rose up in revolt against it. And now because the Roman Catholic hierarchy are somewhat handicapped in their wicked work in that land, they set up a howl in America and induce certain politicians to take some hand to induce Mexico to give greater freedom to this cruel religious element to carry on its work. In America these same covetous, dishonest, greedy ones continue with increased force to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses because they tell the truth about them. They care nothing about the welfare of their parishioners. Their only desire is for selfish and unrighteous gain. Concerning them Jehovah’s prophet Jeremiah wrote: “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealcth falsely.” (Jer. 6: 13) God’s prophet here well describes them, when he says: “They are greedy dogs which can never have enough.” (Isa. 56: 11) The religious element is one of the great conspirators working by fraud against the general welfare of mankind. Particularly the religious element known as the Roman Catholic hierarchy has spread its slimy hand over the nations of the earth; but the end of that devilish organization is at hand, and concerning it the prophet of Jehovah says: “0 thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness [selfish robbery, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser].”—</span><span class="font5">Jer. 51: 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The cruel, dishonest and covetous elements have thought to put themselves beyond the power of all punishment; thus they have builded their organization “that he may be delivered from the power of evil”. Here the word “evil” means a calamity upon the wicked, inflicting punishment upon such for his wrongdoing. That punishment or evil comes from Jehovah. (Amos 3: 6) It is sure to come and to reach every part of “Christendom” on earth, and will go forth from nation to nation, and the clergy and the principal ones of their flock composing the ruling elements of “Christendom” shall find no way of escape. (Jer. 25: 32-36) It will be entirely in vain for those covetous ones then to say, ‘ ‘ Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.”(Mic. 3: 11) Now the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its dupes arrogantly carry on their wicked practices, all the time claiming to be immune from punishment at the hand of Almighty God. While they are doing this the obligation and privilege is laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses to carry to the people the message of truth concerning the near approach of Armageddon and what will be the result. While this message is being delivered to the people the clergy say to their coconspirators or allies: ‘No evil can befall us; therefore give no heed to the babble of these so-called “Jehovah’s witnesses”.’ Now let Jehovah’s witnesses rely wholly upon the Word of Jehovah, which he has given for their encouragement, and which says concerning the arrogant and covetous: “They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he, neither shall evil come upon us, neither shall we see sword nor famine: and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.” (Jer. 5: 12-14) The covetous ruling element in “Christendom” have employed many fraudulent schemes to get honor to themselves; hence the prophet says: “Thou hast consulted [devised, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.]</span><span class="font5"> shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.” (Hab. 2: 10) Their schemes have included many to bring about the end of Jehovah’s witnesses, who tell the honest truth from the Word of God. Because these witnesses declare God’s kingdom, Gog and his emissaries form a conspiracy against them to bring about their destruction. (Ps. 83: 4) By thus doing these covetous ones of Satan’s organization have donned the garments of Baal and marked themselves for the slaughter. They have sinned, and shall die.—Ezek. 18: 4, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•• The ruling elements of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ in practicing covetousness have builded their organization for selfish gain and will hear the elements of their building crying out against their oppressive hand, and that in the very near future: “For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.” (Hab. 2: 11) The stones in that building represent oppression and bloodshed. Just as Abel’s blood cried out from the ground, so shall the blood of the oppressed cry out against the oppressors. (Gen. 4:10) Jehovah hears those cries, and a house-wrecking will follow. (Ex. 22: 27; Jas. 5: 4) Every part of the house or organization erected and occupied by “Christendom’s” rulers is tainted, and even though it be held in high esteem amongst men it is an abomination in the sight of Almighty God.—Luke 16: 14,15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> “Christendom” has closed her eyes and ears to the Word of God. By the laws made and executed by her dictators she now seeks to slay all those who speak the truth of and concerning God and his kingdom. Her avaricious and covetous spirit is of Satan, and, moving forward by such covetous and wicked motives, she now denies the use of the radio to those who speak the truth of God’s Word and attempts to completely ban the printed message of the kingdom and keep it away from the people. Thus “Christendom’s” ruling element seek now to strengthen the walls of her house and make them proof against the sound of God’s message of truth. But now every part of that structure will cry out, and Jehovah will hear those cries and by his Executioner he will completely destroy the oppressors. Their strong-arm squad and great military powers will avail them nothing, but will be like the rust and canker of their gold, and all shall be a witness against them. (Jas. 5: 3) Jehovah can and will make the very stones to cry out.—Luke 19: 40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> Let Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs and all who love righteousness now remember that the day of deliverance is near at hand and for that reason Satan and his cohorts are doing everything within their power against those who are for God and his government of righteousness. For the comfort of those who are now devoted to God these prophecies were written, long ago. Now they are being unfolded for the education, aid and comfort of God’s people. The day is here when these woes against Satan’s organization must be proclaimed. It is a time of great stress, and for that reason we must expect much persecution at the hand of the enemy. Daily Jehovah is loading his people with the benefits of his precious Word. Do you desire more that you may continue to grow strong in the Lord and in the power of his might ? There is more to follow.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N HIS grand prophecy as to the fate of the Devil’s organization, which was pictured by a terrible image made in the likeness of a man and which was smitten and ground to powder by a stone cut out Of a mountain by invisible power, the prophet Daniel pointed forward to our day and said: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold [of the terrible image]; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.” —Dan. 2:44, 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems quite evident that the prophet Daniel, in speaking of ‘the stone cut out without hands’, refers to the birth of The Nation or government established by Jehovah God. By the time of the end of the World War, in 1918, the church denominations, particularly the clergy and the leaders and principal of their flock who pretended to believe and follow Christ Jesus, were provided with abundant proof from the Bible and from fulfilled prophecy that the Lord was invisibly present, that the world had ended, that the time for the beginning of God’s kingdom had come. In fact, shortly after the capture of Jerusalem by the allied armies, eight distinguished clergymen met in the city of London, England, and issued the following manifesto, declaring:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“First.—That the present crisis points toward the close of the times of the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Second.—That the revelation of the Lord may be expected at any moment, when he will be manifested as evidently as to his disciples on the evening of his resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Third.—That the completed church will be translated, to be ‘for ever with the Lord’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fourth.—That Israel will be restored to its own land in unbelief, and be afterward converted by the appearance of Christ on its behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fifth.—That all human schemes of reconstruction must be subsidiary to the second coming of our Lord, because all nations will be subject to his rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sixth.—That under the reign of Christ there will be a further great effusion of the holy spirit on all flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Seventh.—That the truths embodied in this statement are of the utmost practical value in determining Christian character and action with reference to the pressing problems of the hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This remarkable statement was signed by A. C. Dixon and F. B. Meyer, Baptists; George Campbell Morgan and Alfred Byrd, Congregationalists; William Fuller Gouch, Presbyterian; H. Webb Peploe, J. Stuart Holden, Episcopalians; Dinsdale T. Young, Methodist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are well known names, and are among the world’s greatest preachers. That these eminent men, of different denominations, should feel called upon to issue such a statement is of itself exceedingly significant. This manifesto was sent to the clergy throughout the world and was by them rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the most remarkable part of the affair is that the very men who signed the manifesto subsequently repudiated it and rejected the evidence which proves that we are at the end of the world and in the day of the Lord’s second presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The psalmist, the prophet of God, referred to this same time and event, to wit, the birth of The Nation and the rejection of Christ the chief corner stone by the pretended builders, when he wrote: ‘ ‘ The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s [Jehovah’s] doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” —Ps. 118:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead of heeding the truth and proclaiming it to the people, and advising them that the time had come for the reign of Christ, the clergy repudiated Christ and his kingdom, rejected him who is the chief corner stone of Zion, and openly and boldly supported and advocated the Devil’s substitute for Christ’s kingdom, to wit, the League of Nations, and proclaimed that League of Nations as the political manifestation of God’s kingdom on earth. Otherwise stated, they ignore God’s method and manner of establishing his kingdom and willingly ally themselves with the Devil, supporting the League which the Scriptures describe as his “image of the beast”.—Rev. 13: 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jewish clergy in their time rejected Christ, the chief corner stone. Now the clergy of modern times do the same thing. They, together with the principal of their flock, being disobedient to the Word of God, stumble, and fall upon the stone or new government now born. Mark how well the prophetic words of the apostle Peter fit the present situation: “Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed.” (1 Pet. 2:7, 8; Ps. 118:22; Isa. 8:14) Thus the kingdom of God was taken away from those who pretended to represent the Lord, and the words of Jesus were fulfilled. (Matt. 21:43, 44) Those who rejected it ‘fell upon the stone and were broken’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Nation of Righteousness is born. God’s kingdom has begun to function. The Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the nations and peoples of earth take note! (Ps. 11:4-7; Hab. 2:20) “The Lord hath a controversy with the nations” who have given themselves over to the Devil. (Jer. 25: 31) “The great and the terrible day of the Lord” approaches.—Joel 2: 31.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that Satan the enemy has been expelled from heaven since the year 1914 and has come down to earth, having great wrath against the Lord Jehovah and his anointed; seeing that the enemy has now come in with a flood of error to turn the minds of the people away from God (Isa. 59:19); and seeing that the greatest crisis of the ages is just about to break upon the earth, the anointed servants of God are breathing the prayer long ago recorded by their prototype David, to wit: “Be thou exalted, 0 God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.” (Ps. 108:5) Back from the courts of heaven comes the response of God through his holy prophet: “Be still, and know that I am God; I .will be exalted among the [nations], I will be exalted in the earth.”—Ps. 45:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the light of the present-day fulfillment of divine prophecy these words of the Lord thrill the hearts of Christians, because they see that the time for the deliverance of the human race from the bondage of Satan the enemy is at hand. With keen expectation they almost breathlessly watch the development of the events preparing for the great battle. Jesus taught his followers to pray: ‘ ‘ Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” This of itself is conclusive proof that with the birth of the kingdom or nation of righteousness God’s will would begin to be done on the earth. It follows, then, that Satan’s organization must be destroyed, because the righteous Messiah, Christ, cannot rule and bless the peoples of earth so long as Satan holds sway. We may know that Satan the enemy, arrogant, presumptuous, defiant and wieked beyond the description of words, will make a desperate fight to hold his power. This will mean a battle on earth such as men have never known. This is the reasonable conclusion. Is it Scriptural?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'The scripture says: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12: 12) Since the World War the burdens and trials of the people continue to increase. They are now experiencing some of the woes foretold in this scripture, but not all of them yet. The expenses of governments increase. Some of the people’s money must be taken to prepare for another great war. The wicked are set up, and the proud appear to be happy, even though they are not. While this is going on the faithful witnesses for God are carrying out the command given them by the Lord, who said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The word “end” used in this text is translated from the Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">telos,</span><span class="font5"> which means the conclusion of an act or state, the limit, the final end. By this it is understood that when the witness has been given as here commanded by the Lord, then a final conclusion of Satan’s empire shall be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What shall mark the end or conclusion thereof? Jesus answers that this will be marked by tribulation upon earth such as man has never before known. (Matt. 24:21, 22) The prophet Daniel corroborates this and says that the time mentioned is shortly to follow the birth of The Nation, at which time Messiah, the great Prince who stands for the people, stands up. That is the time spoken of by the prophet, when Jehovah sends forth his anointed One as King to destroy the enemy and his power. That will mark the time of the deliverance of the people from the bondage of the enemy. “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”—Dan. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But why should there come a great trouble on earth more terrible than man has ever before known ? Briefly call to mind what has occurred during the past six thousand years. Satan the enemy was created perfect, beautiful and glorious; and God highly honored him by clothing him with power and authority, appointing him as overlord of man and making him a light-bearer, his name at that time being Lucifer. He betrayed that trust and confidence, became guilty pf treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and since then has been leading the way in all wickedness. During all the ages Satan has reproached God and mocked him, that he might turn the minds of men away from their only Benefactor and true Friend. (Prov. 17:17) He introduced hypocrisy among the people that they might mock God. (Gen. 4:26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> Teaching the people to ignore and repudiate God, Satan caused them to build a tower of Babel and induced them to believe that they could save themselves. There God gave the people a lesson, and a very severe one; but they did not heed it.—Gen. 11:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Call to mind again that when God’s people were domiciled in Egypt, Pharaoh, as the Devil’s representative, oppressed them; and when God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh of God’s command he defiantly said: ‘Who is the Lord God, that I should obey him?’ Then God went down to them to make for himself a name. (2 Sam. 7 •. 23) To this end the Lord slew the Egyptians and miraculously delivered his own people, carrying them safely through the sea. “Nevertheless, he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. ’ ’—Ps. 105: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Call to mind further that when the Assyrian ruler, Sennacherib, reproached God, blasphemed his holy name, presumptuously assumed to be greater than Jehovah God and defied the Lord and his people, God sent his angel and slew the Assyrian army in one night.-—2 Ki. 19:35-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the nations of earth have failed to take heed to these things and to learn a lesson therefrom. Their religious teachers not only have failed to teach them the meaning of such lessons, but have actually spurned the Bible. Arrogance, hauteur, contemptuousness, presumptuousness and blasphemy against God have in this present day reached the superlative degree. Hypocrisy has matured and gone to seed. Of all the reproaches that have been brought upon God’s holy name, of all the insolence and vainglory on the part of men and religious systems, of all the presumptuous sins committed against God by men or organizations, those in times past pale into insignificance when compared with those of the present time. And because of this fact the great battle of Armageddon must come, and that at a not distant day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVINE WISDOM GUIDING MESSAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brothek Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I wish to convey my appreciation and encouragement in your efforts to honor our heavenly Father’s name. And our heart goes out in love to you as we realize the effort it must have required in getting out of a sick bed to deliver the most wonderful discourse yet given by you, as the one on January 13 to the public at Los Angeles, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Often the hardest trials bring the greatest joy when they are over and we realize the results and success accomplished. Surely all Zion can rejoice as we realize divine wisdom is guiding the message, and not just merely man’s honest effort to accomplish a work. And this should inspire a desire for teamwork in each member of the remnant, so that we can all pull together for the vindication of our loving Father’s name, and that he has indeed set each member in the body as it has pleased him. And that position brings both responsibility and joy to the fully consecrated of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we have assurance in 1 Corinthians 10: 11, all ages were pointing down to this very time in which Zion's God would triumph. Surely our message is too good to keep, and we greatly rejoice with you in your successful guidance by the hand of Jehovah to tell it out and advertise the name of Jehovah and his King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother for the triumph of Zion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">S. A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Keith, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIGHTED WITH THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I thought you would be pleased to hear of the following experience while on the pioneer work. I will try to be brief, knowing you are very busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I met a lady who had read most of the books and had been praying that one of Jehovah’s witnesses would go along. Our meeting, she said, was an answer to prayer. She was overjoyed to be able to talk of Jehovah and his kingdom. She took what literature she hadn’t already got, also gave me a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription. I told her of the phonograph and asked if she would like to invite a few friends to her home to hear some of the lectures. She was delighted, and after corresponding with her a meeting was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a pleasant surprise on arriving there, for the following notice was fastened outside the shop: &quot;All who are interested in Jehovah’s Kingdom and the Second Coming of Christ are invited to a meeting here on Sunday at 2: 45 p.m., when two of Jehovah’s witnesses will be present with a machine on which they will give some lectures by Judge Rutherford. All are welcome. No collection will be taken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were twelve present, and many interesting questions were asked. The people were delighted with the Truth and hoped we would go again. The lady herself is going to try to get the records. Three books and six booklets were left. What a joyful privilege to have a share in this most important work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praying Jehovah’s rich blessing upon you as you seek to honor and serve Him, with Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your sister in Kingdom joys,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">M. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Naylor, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘JEHOVAH SUPPLYING ALL NEEDS’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being mindful of the words of the apostle, “In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you,” I take this opportunity to express my joy and gratitude for the great blessings and helps derived from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies. This is surely of the Lord, our great Jehovah God, who according to his promise is supplying all our needs through Christ Jesus; and how needful and encouraging are all these helps in this “day of preparation”! Indeed, food convenient. Without it we could not stand nor ‘endure to the end’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The articles on “The Crucible”, “Lions’ Mouths,” and the great climax to the vindication of Jehovah’s great name, as pictured in “Jehovah’s Battle”, how thrilling, comforting and strengthening beyond words! No wonder Zion bursts forth into songs of praise and thanksgiving unto the Most High in preparation for the final conflict! “Zion heard, and was glad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only the selfish and ungrateful, those who have no appreciation of God’s wonderful provision for his people, could say, “The Society is engaged in a book-selling scheme”; or, “There is too much said about the vindication of Jehovah’s name,” etc. These very words have been heard amongst the Easton company of Jehovah’s witnesses. Such, as in Moses’ day, are complainers, murmurers, not merely against the Society and its president, but against the Lord himself, who ‘prepares the table in the presence of our enemies’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• Am glad and thankful to say that all those who remain in the Easton company are one, united in the publication of the &quot;kingdom message, singing forth God’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord continue to bless you and guide you in your work and labor of love till the work is finished and Jehovah’s name vindicated to the glory of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With grateful heart I am, by the grace of God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your fellow witness in kingdom service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hiram</span><span class="font4"> P. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kleinhans, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PEOPLE FRIENDLY AFTER SOUND CAR WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear beloved Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in the name of Jehovah:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May we take just a moment of your time to tell you what a blessing we, Jehovah’s witnesses of Swainsboro [Ga.], received by the visit of Sound Car No. If</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Swainsboro has been well woiked; so few books were placed. With the trouble Jehovah’s witnesses encountered in Griffin in their last campaign, “Religious Intolerance” proved a very appropriate lecture, which was put on in the business section. At night we put on lectures in the residential section with the pole 40 feet high. The next day we had report that it was heard all over town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the second day we went to Midville. The last time we worked there they wanted to throw one of the workers into the river. So this town received a good witness with the sound car. One of the lectures was “Sheep and Goats”. On visiting the people after the lectures the people were friendly to the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Waynesboro also got a good witness. We put up the mast right in the business section. One man was heard saying, “Judge Rutherford has the idea. He makes them hear whether they want to or not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The-third day was spent in Statesboro. Here we put on six lectures in the business section with three different locations, and five lectures in the residential section. If you could have seen the sound car filled with thirteen loyal witnesses singing praises to Jehovah as we traveled to our territory, your heart would have been glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people of an area of fifty miles around Swainsboro know about the sound car, and many of them love to hear the “Kingdom Message”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total work for the three days was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers Books Booklets Hours Testimonies Obtainers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">53 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;529 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;914 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;506</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lectures Meetings Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 Over 5,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank Jehovah for this privilege he has given us of having the “sound car” in our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May Jehovah continue to strengthen you as you endeavor to honor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VINDICATION INVOLVED THEN AND NOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am glad to send you again the report of our Bethel studies at Helsinki office during February, 1935, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Feast of Conspirators” (second part) and “Lions' ■Mouths” (first part) have now been studied. These wonderful stories are extremely interesting already as such, as historical fact, and they become more interesting when we know that God’s name was involved at that time, and still more interesting is the fulfillment at this time to the glory of God. It is encouraging to see the boldness and steadfastness of Daniel, and to notice God’s sure protection. These articles blow into still greater flame the desire to be used by the Lord in his service which will proceed to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been at the meetings the following attendance, to wit: February 5, 15 persons; on the 12th, 14; 19th, 15; and 26th, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our joy is to remember you before the throne of grace, and we wish you best success in the Lord’s service under the shadow of his wings. With warm Christian greetings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your little brother by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eero Nironen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“A GREAT PREJUDICE SMASHER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time we are writing to you to express our great appreciation of the favors we have received in the Lord’s service. We realize that you understand how pioneers appreciate these blessings whether or not they acknowledge them m writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phonograph has been a special blessing. This little handy instrument has become an indispensable part of our equipment. We find it to be a great prejudice smasher. When the hailstones of truth begin to pour forth from this little machine, one can almost see Satan’s invisible cohorts scatter in confusion, leaving the “goats” helpless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are always reminded of the heavenly Father’s care and provision when we receive the new books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> as gifts from headquarters, filled with zealinspiring truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paragraph 19 of the February 15 (1935) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has, we believe, a very timely thought relative to the Watch Tower’s not spending any more time settling disputes amongst the Lord’s people but placing the responsibility upon the anointed to press on doing their part, believing this to be the best way to keep down disputes. This is another move which makes each one of the “three hundred” class feel that the battle is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Would also like to say that the more thoroughly we work our vineyard, the more interesting experiences we have and the greater blessings we enjoy. We are reworking some of our assignment for the third time, and are leaving more literature than previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Altanta convention was a rare treat and a great stimulant to the South. Many thanks for making it possible for the pioneers to attend. Your farewell words were a loving personal touch much appreciated by all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praying the Lord’s continued rich blessings upon you as you fearlessly perform your part in the vindication work, we remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your colaborers in the vineyard,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ONE IN DECLARING VENGEANCE OF GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in the name of our King!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The St. Louis (Mo.) company of Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs join with you in piaise and thanksgiving to Jehovah, the Almighty God, for his favor and blessing this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The shout of Jehovah’s witnesses in Los Angeles was echoed in our hearts here in St. Louis, and we are one with you in unity and harmony in declaring the vengeance of our God for the vindication of his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never was there a discourse more logically presented and ably delivered than was your epochal message heard here today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured, dear brother, of our constant prayers and loyal co-operation as you faithfully serve the cause of truth and righteousness as one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•MACHINES ARE A REAL HELP’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loving greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We felt that we would like to show you our gratitude for granting us the concession of books last May. This enabled us to have a phonograph and nine records and thus enjoy the work begun with the machines. They are a real help to the cottage meetings, and it thrills our heart to see the people listen with joy at some new revelation of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had our phonograph for five weeks, and have formed two classes, one having a set of discs for themselves. These are going to continue the meetings after we have left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We see Jehovah is greatly blessing this work, and we are grateful to him that he has permitted us to have a part in it. We are also grateful for the food convenient which comes through the Lord’s channel, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praying Jehovah to richly bless you and keep you always, with much love and thanks we remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Connell and</span><span class="font4"> A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Player, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“DETERMINATION TO CO-OPERATE FAITHFULLY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Watch Tower Office,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the President, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Greetings !</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Panama company of Jehovah’s witnesses desire to express our thanks for the helps received from the Society by which we can more effectively conduct our part of the Kingdom service. We desire to make special mention of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">articles; also the transcription machine which you so kindly sent free to us (as we were unable to purchase, much as we had the wish to do so). It is our determination to co-operate faithfully with the Society in giving the kingdom testimony to the best of our ability, looking forward to the time when the great Jehovah will arise and vindicate his holy name before all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR GOD IS ABLE TO DELIVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Deep appreciation and unbounded joy of heart toward our great God, Jehovah, for the message of January 13. Can hardly find human words capable of fully expressing ourselves. I am in full accord with the statement that what we are bringing to the people is not man’s message, but from the Eternal One, whose name alone is Jehovah. Certainly the issue was most clearly drawn. The fight is on, and the greatest crisis of all time is here. Jehovah’s witnesses are indeed facing (as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> points out) the most crucial time. Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us. To realize that by Jehovah’s grace we have reached the point where we count not our own fives dear unto us, but are determined to maintain our integrity even at the cost of our lives, causes all those who truly love and serve Jehovah to stand shoulder to shoulder and cry, “For Jehovah and for Gideon.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May our God strengthen your heart, dear brother, and as your days, so may your strength be. “Praise to Jehovah.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the King’s service,</span></p>

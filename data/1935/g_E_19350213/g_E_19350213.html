<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Universal War Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Broadcast over coast to-coast network by Judge Rutherford from Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Sunday, January 13, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font10">REAT EVENTS have heretofore come to pass and which involved many nations. In the very near future a far greater event will come to pass and which will involve the entire universe. The war of 1914 was the greatest war up to that time. The universal war that is near will be far more stupendous, and only a few persons, comparatively, will survive. Those who do survive will be the ones who receive a knowledge of and who obey the truth. On this occasion attention is directed to the coming universal war in order that the people of good will may have opportunity to be informed and to take the steps necessary for their own protection.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE WAS ASHAMED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> BUSINESS MAN writes that he persistently refused to listen to any of Judge Rutherford’s lectures or to read any of his books. While trying to get something on his radio besides “jazz” he happened to tune In on the talk “UNIVERSAL. WAR NEAR”, and listened. He was suddenly profoundly Impressed with the fact that here was the simple and yet the most astounding truth being set before him. He realized that he had permitted the prejudices of others to erect a barrier between him and the most essential knowledge that people today can have. “I am ashamed,” he confesses, as he considers how foolish he has been, and he Is now most eager to read everything Judge Rutherford has written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;UNIVERSAL WAR NEAR,” which Is widely considered the most Impressive talk Judge Rutherford has ever given, Is now presented, In full, to readers of The GOLDEN AGE.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The conclusions here announced are not based upon the opinion of man, but are fully supported by the inspired prophecy recorded in the Bible. The greatest storehouse of information is the Bible, and without doubt there is greater ignorance amongst the people concerning the Bible than of any book ever written. Because we now stand at the very portals of universal war the information concerning the same, as set forth in the Bible, is of greatest interest, convenience and necessity to the people. Never in the history of the world has there been such a concerted effort made to prevent the freedom of speech as now, and the reason is directly connected with the universal war soon to be fought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That all the nations are now feverishly arming for war, no one will attempt to deny. If you ask the rulers of the nations why this great war preparation, not one will be able to give a satisfactory answer. All nations openly declare that they do not desire war, and yet they go madly on building all manner of machines for the destruction of men and property.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Why Nations Arming</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">What is the real reason why the nations are hurrying to war? The correct answer is, because there is an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">unseen </span><span class="font10">power that is drawing all the nations into an armed camp. Let all persons of good will now lay aside religious, political or other prejudice and calmly consider this matter. The great Jehovah God has put the truth in the Bible for the benefit of man, and through His prophet Isaiah (1:18) He says to men: &quot;Come now, and let us reason together.” Let that admonition be obeyed upon this occasion, and those who do calmly reason will profit thereby. dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of that great day of God Almighty. . . . And they gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.’ (Revelation 16: 13,14,16, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font10"> These words constitute a part of the revelation of things that must speedily come to pass after 1914. The word &quot;dragon” there used is one of the names that God gave to the Devil; and the words “beast” and “false prophet” therein used are names given to the instruments which the Devil uses to accomplish his wicked purpose.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expressly stated in the Bible that it was</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ written for the instruction of man at the time of • the end of the world, where we now are. Further-i more it is stated in Revelation that God has ' given Jesus Christ a revelation of the things I that must speedily come to pass following 1914 <sup>1</sup> and that Christ in turn informs men of what is * coming to pass, if such persons diligently seek I to understand the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At chapter sixteen of Revelation these words ■ are recorded, to wit: ‘And I saw three unclean ’ spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">291</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">“Beast” is the symbolic name used in the Scriptures to describe the visible or earthly part of Satan’s organization that rules the nations of the earth and is made up of three elements, to wit, religion,, commerce, and politics. “False prophet,” used in this text, symbolically means that part of Satan’s visible organization which is his chief spokesman or mouthpiece on the earth. The “false prophet” is composed of the leading nations of “Christendom” speaking for the nations of the world and using the League of Nations as a dummy, like a ventriloquist who appears to speak by a dummy. It is really the wicked Devil speaking through the “false prophet” and using the League of Nations dummy to deceive mankind. Here is the plain statement from God’s Word that the Devil is using invisible wicked spirits and his visible representatives on the earth for the purpose of gathering or drawing all the nations of the world to the great and universal war, which is called in the Scriptures “the war of the great day of God, the Almighty”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Why?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">By what authority can it be said that the gathering of the nations is now taking place and that the universal war is near? The prophecies in the Bible, which are true, give the complete answer to that question. That answer in brief is this: Before the tragedy in Eden all creation honored the name of Jehovah God. Lucifer was, by God’s appointment, the overlord of the earth, and a part of Jehovah’s organization. Lucifer rebelled against God and boasted that he could cause all men to curse and defame the name of Jehovah God and turn them away completely from God. For this wicked rebellion God entered His judgment of death against Lucifer and at the same time changed his name to that of Dragon, Serpent, Satan, and Devil. (Ezekiel 28:13-17; Revelation 20:1-3) God did not execute His judgment against the Devil at the time entered, but, as recorded at Exodus 9:16, Jehovah told Satan that He would permit him to remain and attempt to carry out his boastful challenge before Satan is destroyed and that God would do so that in due time He, Jehovah, might exhibit His own supreme power and cause His own great name to be declared by His witnesses throughout the world. Jehovah God set a specific time during which Satan has been permitted to do all within his power to prove his wicked challenge, and God has declared that at the end of such time He will destroy Satan and his wicked organization. That period of time for the operation of Satan is designated in the Scriptures as a ‘time of waiting’, the end of which period of waiting marks the end of Satan’s world. (Psalm 110:1; Zephaniah 3:8; Matthew 24:3) When that period is reached, then the prophecy of Revelation begins to be fulfilled, and which things must speedily come to pass.—Revelation 1: L</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Question in Dispute</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">During that period of waiting the question in dispute has been, Who is supreme and who shall rule the world? and will the Devil be able to turn all men away from God, or will some of them maintain their integrity toward God? During the waiting period God has not attempted to prevent the Devil from exercising his power over men and nations, but God has kept the truth before mankind so that those who desire might learn and obey the truth and prove faithful to God under the test and thereby maintain their integrity toward the Most High. The end of that period of waiting must come sometime, and when reached it marks the beginning of the preparation for the execution of Satan and his wicked forces in the great universal war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That long period of waiting came to an end in 1914, the proof of which is abundantly given by prophecy and the physical facts in fulfilment thereof. The prophecy of Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, definitely fixes the date of the end of that period of waiting. The first evidence of the end of that period of waiting was the World War, beginning in August 1914. According to Revelation, chapters 11 and 12, there was, about that time, a war also in heaven, resulting in Satan and his wicked angels’ being cast out of heaven and down to the earth, and since then the Devil has confined his work to the nations of the earth. Since 1914 great woes-have come upon the world; as it is written, in Revelatipn 12:12: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” As there stated, the Devil sees that his time is short in which he must prepare for the great and final battle, and his purpose is to destroy all men rather than to see any man serve Jehovah God. In no other way could Satan win the great issue between himself and Almighty God. And Satan is certain to fail!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Gathering the Nations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">It was in 1918 that the Lord began to gather His faithful ones unto himself and to cause them to declare that the kingdom of God under Christ is here and is the hope of the world. From that time forward the Devil hastens to draw the nations into the war camp. It was about the same time that the League of Nations was formed, which is the Devil’s substitute for God’s kingdom, and which League is employed to deceive the nations and to blind the people to the truth that God’s kingdom is the only hope of mankind. Now the Devil uses his invisible forces, composed of wicked spirits, and his visible forces, composed of the “beast” and the “false prophet”, to deceive the people and to gather the nations of the whole world together for the universal war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do the rulers of the nations of the earth and those forming the “false prophet” know that the Devil is the real power that is drawing them into this universal war? The Scriptures and the facts show that they do not know and understand it. Although they have been repeatedly told and warned, they do not believe the testimony of God’s Word, and hence are not enlightened. They are in the dark as to what God’s Word really teaches, for the reason that the Bible has been repudiated by those who claim to teach it. The Scriptures designate the Devil as the prince of darkness and the great deceiver of man, and the one who blinds men to the truth lest they should see and learn the truth and serve Jehovah God. (2 Corinthians 4:3,4) If the rulers in “Christendom” really knew and believed that the Bible is the inspired Word of God they would turn away from the League of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nations and forsake all parts of Satan’s organization and would give their allegiance to the kingdom of God under Christ, which Jehovah declares is the only hope of the nations.— Matthew 12:21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Three Unclean Spirits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Mark that the Scriptures relating to the gathering of the nations to the universal war say that the Devil, the beast and the false prophet are the three unclean spirits or demons, that is, wicked invisible powers, which go forth to gather the earthly rulers to the great war. Such gathering is being done by false messages declared and proclaimed to the nations by those unclean spirits. Those wicked ones the divine prophecy likens unto frogs, which symbolically means that they speak great swelling words, look wise, and make believe that they know much. The false messages that come out of the mouth of these wicked spirits may be summed up in these few words which they are declaring to the nations, to wit: ‘Come, let us associate ourselves together in a league to rule the world; let us make peace pacts, set up world courts, and associate ourselves together in covenants, and together let us robe the earth in glory and beauty and make it a place fit to live in. Such is within the power of the nations, and let us do it.’ That is an expression of a conspiracy of the nations, led by the Devil conspiring against God and His kingdom, as stated by the prophet, to wit (Psalm 2:2,3): ‘The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed, saying, Let us disregard God and His kingdom and run the world to suit ourselves.’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Willingly Ignorant</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Do the leading men of “Christendom” fully realize that they are playing into the hands of the wicked Satan and are joining in a conspiracy against God and His kingdom? The scripture at 2 Peter 3 answers that: ‘They are willingly ignorant of this fact, because they will not hear and will not believe the truth.’ Therefore Satan is leading them into his trap. In the language of Jesus those worldly leaders are made blind by Satan and they are blindly leading the people into the ditch. (Matthew 23:16) Why, then, is it the will of God that this warning be now given to the people? In order that the people who desire righteousness may be informed and hasten to the place of refuge before the universal war breaks upon the world. All people who </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font10">not hear and heed the warning and break </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font10">from Satan’s organization will go down with that wicked organization.-Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Demonstration of Supreme Power</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Why, then, are the nations now so extensively arming for war? Are they doing this knowing that they are going to engage in the universal war ? They do not know why they are arming, and can give no good reason why. There is no real reason why Japan should go to war with America, or why France should go to war with Italy. The real reason why the nations are arming is, because Satan and his wicked angels are forcing them into the great war eamp with the hope and expectation of turning all the nations away from God and His kingdom, and also of destroying those people who stand firm for the kingdom of God. Thereby Satan expects to win the great question in controversy. The majority of the leaders of the nations of the earth do not believe the Bible, and hence do not believe that a universal war is impending and about to break, and hence they are being deceived by Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The name and Word of Almighty God is involved, and that holy name must be vindicated, and the way God will vindicate His name is by the demonstration of His supreme power. Jehovah God is the only source of life. Satan cannot give life to any creature. AU persons who remain on Satan’s side must, with Satan, be destroyed. AH those who will live must take their stand on the side of Almighty God and be faithful and true to Him. Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ, and there is no other way to get life. (Acts 4:12) Those who do not gain life everlasting must die and remain dead forever. The Devil, in order to deceive the people, has always held before mankind the lie that there is no death. The destruction of Satan and his organization not only wiU prove Satan a liar and vindicate Jehovah’s name but will operate beneficially to every creature that sincerely desires to live. These great truths are now being brought to the attention of the people at the command of the Lord, and they give aH people of good wiU the opportunity of taking the right side and finding life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When God sentenced Satan to death, at the same time He declared that He would appoint </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">righteous King to rule the world and to administer blessings </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">all the nations of the earth that obey Him. That righteous One is called the ‘Seed of promise’, is the rightful Ruler of the world, and His name is Jesus Christ the Lord. In 1914 God enthroned Christ Jesus, and there He began His reign, as it is written in Psalm 2:6, to wit: ‘I have set my King upon my holy throne.’ To the Lord Jesus Jehovah then said (at Psalm 110: 2): “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” Christ Jesus has begun His rule, but He must first oust Satan and his organization and destroy wickedness in the universe, that righteousness may completely prevail. Satan well knows that his time is up and that he must give up the rulership of the world or fight, and that if he loses the fight that means his complete end. Satan therefore assembles all of his forces against God’s organization and prepares for the great universal war, which war will involve not only all the nations of the earth but all of the heavenly host.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Alignment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Since the year 1919 the three unclean spirits mentioned in Revelation 16 have been uttering their boastful words and working under Satan’s direction to gather his forces to the universal war. On the Devil’s side are all the wicked angels of the universe, led by Satan’s chief marshal, who is named Gog. The ruling powers of the nations of the earth are completely dominated by Satan, and these form his visible organization, the chief part of which is designated under the symbols of “beast” and the “false prophet”; therefore says the scripture (1 John 5:19): ‘The whole world lies in the wicked one Satan.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The world war that began in 1914 was instigated by the Devil for the purpose of destroying the nations, and that war would have continued until all the nations were wrecked; but according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, at Matthew 24, Jehovah stopped that war in 1918 and cut it short in order that He might give His witnesses an opportunity to give testimony to the nations of earth, which testimony must be completed immediately preceding the great and universal war. It was in 1918 that Christ Jesus came to His temple, and shortly thereafter began the gathering together of those whom God has designated as His witnesses and who are sent forth to give the testimony of Jesus Christ-Now both the Scriptures and the physical facts show that the giving of that testimony is near the end and that Satan has gathered the nations iuto his war camp; hence it may be confidently stated that the universal war is very near. The nations of the earth, blindly moving under the influence of Satan, are arming for a great struggle, and while this arming and gathering is being completed Jehovah’s witnesses are diligent in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ as God has commanded that they must do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Churches</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the alignment for the universal war, which side will the churches take? The answer is found both in the Scriptures and in the physical facts. The churches form the religious part of the world’s organization, and hence are a part of the world. All of the churches and their leaders participate in the politics of the world, and about that there is no dispute. The churches and their clergymen, forming a part of the world, are therefore, according to the Scriptures, enemies of God. (James 4: 3,4) In the language of God’s prophet, the church leaders call upon the name of God by the mouth only, but their heart devotion is to Satan’s world. Concerning these religious organizations it is written;- at Matthew 15:8,9: “This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (See Isaiah 29:13.) The majority of the clergy deny the inspiration of the Bible, and particularly that part which declares that Jesus is the Savior and King of the world. The church leaders do not tell the people that the kingdom of God under Christ is the only hope of the nations, but, on the contrary, they join with the political and commercial rulers in support of the League of Nations and hail it as the substitute for God’s kingdom and call it the only light of the world. The League of Nations is the Devil’s creation; and since the churches support the League of Nations, they have thereby aligned themselves against God and His kingdom and therefore take the enemy’s side. This is the real reason why the clergy vigorously oppose the testimony concerning God’s kingdom which is being delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses. It is the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses suffer persecution at their hand. The religious organizations form a part of that organization which rules the earth, and which is designated in the Scriptures under the name of “Babylon”. To the people of good will Jehovah, through His prophet Jeremiah (51: 6), now says: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul; be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord’s vengeance,” or vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God’s expressed purpose is to destroy Satan’s organization, and He warns the people to flee therefrom. This is further evidence that the clergymen who call themselves shepherds or pastors of the flocks, in the churches, will be found on the side of Satan in the universal war. In support of this conclusion, note the language of God’s prophet, to wit (Jeremiah 25: 34, 35): “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.” Mark you, I am not holding churchmen up to ridicule, but I am merely calling these prophetic truths to the attention of the people, that those who desire may learn to be guided by God’s Word and not be guided by the words of man.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Truth Involved</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Why is the truth involved in this universal war? Because Jehovah God is the fountain of truth. His Word is the truth. (John 17:17) All the ways of Jehovah are truth. (Psalms 25:10; 33: 4) “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.” His truth “en-dureth for ever”. (Psalm 117:2) Jesus Christ is the perfect expression of God’s Word of truth. Jehovah sent Jesus to earth to give testimony to the truth and appointed Him as King to rule the world, and concerning this Jesus said (John 18:37): “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.” Every one that is on Jehovah’s side must believe and bear testimony to the truth. The giving of testimony to the truth is true worship of Almighty God in spirit and in truth.—John 4: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That which is the very opposite of truth is a lie. The Bible designates Satan the Devil as a liar and the father of lies; hence Satan and his agents not only manufacture and tell lies but fight against everything that is truth and righteousness. (John 8:44) Almighty God hates a liar. (Proverbs 6:16-19) The Devil hates the truth. Therefore from the time of Eden forward there has been a deadly conflict between lies and truth, and every one that has vigorously advocated God’s truth has been persecuted by Satan and his agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the holy prophets of God from Abel to John suffered martyrdom because they spoke the truth. (Hebrews 11:1-39) When Jesus, the great Messenger of the truth, came to the earth Satan tried to destroy Him because He spoke the truth. Mark this, that in the persecution of Jesus and the other prophets Satan used the religious leaders to do the persecuting, and this is conclusive proof that such religious leaders have been on the Devil’s side. To the clergy and religious leaders that persecuted Jesus He said (John 8:37-44): “Ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. ... Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God.” The religionists of this day likewise persecute Jehovah’s witnesses.—John 15:19-21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Final Show-Down</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">It is Satan who blinds and injects into the minds of men the desire to kill Jesus and His witnesses, and that wicked thing Satan does because Jesus and His witnesses declare God’s purpose is to rule the world in righteousness by Christ Jesus. Satan has always known that the setting up and successful operation of God’s kingdom of righteousness means Satan’s finish, and he has therefore sought the death of every one that has advocated God’s truth concerning the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now the end of the waiting period has come. Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful Ruler, has come. God has placed Him upon His throne of authority. Now there must be a complete show-down as to whether the Devil shall continue to rule the world and keep the people in darkness or Christ Jesus shall rule in righteousness to the glory of Jehovah God, and open to the people the way to everlasting life. That final show-down must shortly take place, and it will take place at the battle of Armageddon. Just before that universal war Jehovah sends forth His witnesses to testify the truth to the people concerning His kingdom. When that testimony is delivered in completeness, then will follow the greatest of all tribulations, which is the universal war of Armageddon. (Matthew 24:14-21) Mark that it is the Devil or Dragon and his agents that are gathering the nations to the universal war, and it is the same Devil or Dragon and his agents that now make war upon and try to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses because Jehovah’s witnesses are telling the truth of and concerning God and His kingdom under Christ. At Revelation 12:17 the plain statement is made that the Dragon is angry with those of God’s organization and goes forth to make war with Jehovah’s witnesses,.who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. These are some of the reasons why the truth is involved in the universal war.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Sedition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The crime of sedition is defined by earthly authorities as “incitement to discontent against the government”. God’s faithful prophets of 61d were persecuted to death upon the false charge of sedition, because they spoke the truth of God’s Word. Jesus was falsely charged and wrongfully convicted of the crime of sedition because He spoke the truth which was considered by the rulers as inciting the people against the government. The common people heard Jesus gladly, because He told them of God’s purpose to give them a righteous government and the boundless blessings it would bring. The clergy of that time, as a part of Satan’s organization, called a council to determine how they might destroy Jesus, and the high priest on that occasion used these words (John 11:47-51): ‘If we let this man Jesus alone all men will believe on him. . . . Consider that it is expedient for rrs that one man should die.’ That was a conspiracy to commit murder. Thereafter, at the instance of the clergy, Jesus was charged with sedition and put to death. The faithful apostles were likewise charged with sedition, because they told the truth. (Acts 5:28) Jehovah’s witnesses today are commanded by the Lord to tell the truth of and concerning His righteous government, and because they do so in obedience to that commandment they are charged with crime and imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only a few days ago, in Quebec, two of Jehovah’s witnesses were wrongfully convicted of the crime of sedition because they distributed amongst the people a booklet telling of God’s kingdom under Christ. It was the clergy, both Catholic and Protestant, who voluntarily appeared at that trial against Jehovah’s witnesses and who testified that these Bible truths would tend to bring about a revolution. It is easy to be seen that Satan was back of that persecution and blinded religious men and used them as his instruments to accomplish his wicked designs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Jailed for Telling Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Less than a month ago a young man in Germany called on his sweetheart and showed to her passages in the Bible concerning God’s kingdom, which shall soon replace the kingdoms of this world, including the Hitler government, and for that offense the young man was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The reason is that the Devil is in complete charge of the government of Germany and is desperately attempting to keep the truth concerning God’s kingdom away from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just now all the nations are attempting to suppress the truth. In several of the state legislatures bills are pending to suppress the truth. In the Congress now in session attempts will be made to cause the enactment of law to suppress the freedom of speech and making it a crime to tell the truth. When such laws are enacted, then look for greater persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses who bear testimony to the truth concerning God’s kingdom under Christ. Members of Congress and other public officials will soon demonstrate which side they are on in the great universal controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The radio is one of the God-given means of transmitting the truth to the people. The official record of testimony recently taken by the Federal Communications Commission concerning radio broadcasting is now before the Congress of the United States. That official record discloses that the two great broadcasting corporations of America, to wit, the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System, have entered into an agreement with the clergy by which Jehovah’s witnesses are wholly denied the use of their radio facilities to broadcast the truth of and concerning God's kingdom. They have created what they call “the chubch of the air”, which limits broadcasting of all matters pertaining to the Bible to the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergy and with the understanding that none of these will say anything about their belief in the Bible that might shock the religious susceptibilities of another. That unholy arrangement denies the people the opportunity of hearing the message of truth by the great radio stations of the land, and the purpose and effect is to suppress the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why this discrimination against Jehovah’s witnesses? Is it because the religionists are afraid of them? No; because Jehovah’s witnesses are small in number and would harm no one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The real reason is, because that old Dragon the Devil is desperately attempting to keep the people in ignorance of the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom under Christ and is blinding selfish men and using them as his instruments to accomplish his wrongful purposes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Many Independent Stations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">But more than ninety </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">independent</span><span class="font10"> radio stations are now broadcasting this speech. In behalf of millions of American people I express to the owners and managers of those independent radio stations keen appreciation of their cooperation in carrying this message to the people, and I commend such stations to the favorable consideration of all honest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan would keep the people in ignorance of the universal war that is near, in order that he might prevent them from seeking the way of escape. Upon the members of Congress there now rests a tremendous responsibility. Every member of Congress who votes to continue the present method of controlling the facilities of the big radio stations, and permitting the selfish clergy, by the practice of boycott and coercive methods, to prevent the use of radio stations by Jehovah’s witnesses, will thereby be taking the Devil’s side of this great controversy, and hence fighting against God. They will therefore align themselves on the enemy’s side in the coming universal war. Congress would do well to consider the present situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every law that is enacted for the purpose of suppressing freedom of speech and publication of the truth will be an act of fighting against God. In the battle alignment for the universal war you may be certain that the ruling powers of the present nations of the earth will be on the side of Satan the Dragon, because, say the Scriptures, ‘he goes forth unto the kings of the whole world to gather them to the war of that great day of God Almighty.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rulers are not opposing Jehovah’s witnesses and the message of God’s Word because they have a grudge against Jehovah’s witnesses, nor because they even think Jehovah’s witnesses are important. They are opposing because they fear the truth and because their universal leader, Satan the Dragon, has blinded them and is leading them to the place of Armageddon.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Jehovah’s Side</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The word &quot;Armageddon” means the &quot;place of assembly of troops” of Jehovah the Almighty God. It is Satan and his wicked forces that come up to make war against Jehovah’s troops. Where, then, is the place of assembly of Jehovah’s troops, and who is on God’s side? The Scriptures disclose that the organization of Jehovah God is symbolically called “Mount Zion”; that there assembled are Christ Jesus and His close associates, such as the faithful risen apostles, and also a multitudinous host of holy angels. It is that invisible or spiritual host that will engage in the great war. On the earth, and forming a part of Jehovah’s army, is the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses, and these also Satan is attempting to kill. The only part that Jehovah’s witnesses will perform in the universal war is to bear testimony before the nations and peoples of the earth concerning God’s purpose by and through His kingdom. Jehovah's witnesses must perform their part before the real battle begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the prophecy of Christ Jesus the World War was stopped in 1918 that testimony might be given to the nations and peoples concerning the Kingdom. To His witnesses the Lord commanded that this testimony must be given as a witness to the nations first, and when it is done, He added (Matthew 24:14-21), “then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” This testimony Jehovah’s witnesses must give, and their failure or refusal to do so would mean their own destruction. During the past fifteen years, in obedience to God’s commandments, Jehovah’s witnesses have been giving this testimony to the nations. They have published this gospel message in more than sixty languages and placed in the hands of the people books containing that message to the number of more than 178 million. Many millions of people by reading those books have learned the truth, even though greatly opposed by Satan and his agents. The Scriptural evidence and the physical facts strongly indicate that such witness work is now almost done, and when it is done the universal war will begin.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Sudden Destruction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Universal war is absolutely certain to come, and that soon, and no power can stop it. The Almighty God has decreed that it shall be fought to rid the universe of wickedness. God does not change. (Malachi 3:6) His decree once made must be carried out. He says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) During the long period of waiting, from the resurrection of Jesus until now, God has commanded those who have faith in Him to wait patiently for His due time to act. To such He has said (Zephaniah 3:8): “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the few remaining months until the breaking of that universal cataclysm the powers that rule the nations of the earth will continue to make treaties and tell the people that by such means they will keep the world peace and bring about prosperity. They will also continue to enact and enforce strenuous laws to suppress the freedom of speech and to take away the liberties of the people. They will continue to persecute and oppose Jehovah’s witnesses who are trying to get the truth to the people. Having laid a strong hand upon the people and completely subdued them, then the dictatorial powers of the nations of the earth will say: “Now we are at peace and in safety”; and the scripture replies thereto, at 1 Thessalonians 5:3: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Fight</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Through His prophet Zechariah God tells how the fight will begin and what will be the result. You who desire to know should study that prophecy which is explained in the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font10"> Armageddon will be the battle of God Almighty against all the powers of wickedness, both seen and unseen. Through the prophet Zechariah God says: “I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle.” “Jerusalem” symbolically stands for Jehovah’s organization, and hence includes all who are on the side of God and His kingdom. Jehovah is commander in chief of all the forces of righteousness, and He selects the place of battle, and there the battle must be fought. That place is called “Armageddon”, and against it Satan assembles his forces. When the visible rulers of this world have apparently subdued all opposition and when the telling of the testimony by Jehovah’s witnesses is completed, the fight will begin, and Jehovah God will fully demonstrate to all creation that He is supreme and all-powerful. Concerning this His prophet Zechariah (chapter 14) says: “Then shall [Jehovah] go forth and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle,” in times of old. By reference to God’s fighting against the enemies of Israel in times of old we are given some insight as to how the universal war will be fought. The holy prophets record that Jehovah God fought against the enemies of Israel, to wit, the Mid-ianites, Sisera, and others, and that those fights foretell the manner of the battle at Armageddon. (Psalm 83:9,10; Isaiah 28:21) “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. The river . . . swept . . . away” multitudes. (Judges 5:20,21) In a battle led by Joshua against the combined enemies of God’s chosen people, it is written, God caused the sun and the moon to stand still and threw great chunks of ice down from heaven and thereby destroyed multitudes.—Joshua 10:10-14.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Jehovah’8 Invincible Forces</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah will employ like weapons of war against His enemies at Armageddon. Concerning the coming universal war it is written by the prophet Joel (3:15,16): “The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining; The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Guns, air machines, battleships, and poison gas will be of no avail against the forces of Almighty God under Christ. That universal war will demonstrate to all creation that the power hurled against the enemy is supreme and that hence it is Jehovah of hosts who is doing the victorious fighting. Says the prophet Zechariah (14:12): “And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This means that the visible forces of Satan, while standing on their feet and on the march, the Almighty God will mow down. When the earthly armies of Satan attempt to shout, says the prophet, Their tongues shall consume away out of their mouth.’ While using their field glasses to discover the location of God’s faithful ones, the prophet says, ’their eyes shall consume away in their sockets.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Religious teachers will now say to you: “We do not believe anything of the kind. Do not hear those old fogy prophets.” Their prototypes said the same thing in opposition to God’s prophet Jeremiah, and then God destroyed them. (Jeremiah 28:1-17; 29: 20-32) When the enemy stood before Jerusalem and demanded immediate surrender and the repudiation of Almighty God, then Jehovah smote 185,000 of them in an instant. (Isaiah 37:8-36) These things were recorded in the Bible merely as types of the universal war. Jesus says that universal war will be the worst the world has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Christendom” has hypocritically taken the name of Jesus Christ, the Head of God’s organization, and the leaders of “Christendom” tell the people that they will make the earth a safe place in which to live and that no evil shall befall the people. To “Christendom” Jehovah says through His prophet Jeremiah (25:29-31): “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. ... A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations,” and all of them that are wicked God will destroy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Result</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The net result of that universal war will be the complete destruction of every creature that stands on the side of Satan and fights against God. As to the number of the slain in that war, note these words of the prophet Jeremiah (25: 33): “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The forces of Almighty God at Armageddon will be led by Jesus Christ, and concerning Him it is written: ‘He is called the Faithful and True, and in righteousness He doth make war.’ (Revelation 19:11-15) ‘The armies which are in heaven follow Him. And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword with which He should smite the nations.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mark again that it is the Devil and his organization that by means of deceit and fraud gather the rulers of the earth to the war, and concerning the result of that fight it is written (Revelation 19:19-21): “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against [Christ] . . . and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet. . . . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The host of wickedness will suffer complete defeat at the hand of the Lord of righteousness, and then the Devil shall be destroyed, as it is written in Revelation 20:1-3: “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more.” Thus the righteous war shall completely and for ever cleanse the world of wickedness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Not Looking for Trouble</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Before that terrible war is fought, however, Jehovah’s witnesses know that they must inform the people by delivering God’s message of truth to them. These witnesses of Jehovah have no fight with human creatures. They are not seeking trouble, but are giving testimony in obedience to God’s commandment; and thus they worship the Almighty God. While doing this work they know that they will be viciously assaulted by Satan and his agents, but they will go on with their work fearing neither man nor devil, because Jehovah says to them (Isaiah 51:16): “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The lawmakers of the nations, goaded on by their religious allies, will continue to make laws to suppress the proclamation of the truth, and this they will do at their own peril, because they have been warned. The courts will continue to side-step the issue and render decisions contrary to the fundamental law of the land and in violation of God’s holy law, and thus they participate in opposing and suppressing the truth. Regardless of all this Jehovah’s witnesses will go on in their work, as harmless as doves and with the boldness of the lion. In the performance of their duty they may die at the hands of men, but their failure to obey God’s commandment would mean their destruction at the hand of Almighty God. Therefore Jesus says to them (Matthew 10: 28): “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in [Gehenna, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Greek}.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Vindication</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Scriptures disclose that the purpose of the battle of the great day of God Almighty is to vindicate the name of Jehovah, that is to say, to prove that Jehovah is the Almighty God of supreme power, that He is all-wise, that justice is the foundation of His throne, and that He is wholly unselfish. He bides His own due time to vindicate His name. He waits until wickedness has run its full course, and then He acts. He has selected Christ Jesus as His mighty instrument to carry out His purpose, because Christ Jesus is always faithful and true to Jehovah. Now Jehovah has enthroned Christ Jesus and sent Him forth to destroy the enemy for the vindication of God’s name. Now to Jesus Jehovah speaks these words (Psalm 45:2-7): “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand [Jehovah] shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. Thy throne, 0 God [0 Mighty One], is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah is the “Right Hand” of Christ Jesus; and of the terrifying things that He causes Christ to do, these are some, as recorded in Isaiah 34: 2-5: “For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree. For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.” These prophecies Jehovah caused to be written and declares that they shall be fulfilled at the end of Satan’s world, where we now are. Their fulfilment is now at hand.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>False Brethren</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the world there are those who profess to be Christians but who are blinded to the truth and who employ their religion for selfish purposes, and who conspire together and with others of the enemy for the destruction of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. These professed Christians claim to be brethren of Christ, even as Esau claimed to be brother of Jacob. They are designated in the prophecy under the names of “Edom” and “Idumea”, dwelling in organizations symbolized by “Bozrah”. In the universal war none of these, whether they be Catholic or Protestant or others, will be on the side of Jehovah, but will join forces with the enemy and go down with the Devil; and here is the proof: Jehovah caused His prophet Isaiah to record a colloquy with Christ Jesus. (Isaiah 63:1-4) The prophet beholds the victorious Christ returning from the universal war and says to Him: “Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?” To this the victorious Christ replied: “I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.” Then says the prophet to Christ: “Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the [winevat] ?” To this Christ replies: “I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people [professed Christians] there was none with me. . . . For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The decree of Jehovah is summed up in a few words (Psalm 145:20): “The Lord preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Today falsehood rides in the saddle and truth is suppressed. With the end of the universal war all lies will cease and truth will be enthroned for ever. Then all creation shall know that the name of the Almighty God is Jehovah. That will be a glorious vindication of His holy name. It will be a time of great blessing to all those who love God and His righteous law. Then the Prince of Peace will lead all the survivors into truth and everlasting righteousness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Safety</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the war universal every man on Satan’s side will turn his hand against his neighbor. Amongst men there will be no place of safety or escape. Jehovah God has provided a way of escape and a place of safety for those who obey His commandments, and for that reason the truth must now be proclaimed to the common people that they may have an opportunity to flee to the place of refuge. When the chosen people of God entered into the land of Palestine they were commanded to build certain cities of refuge. When a man unwittingly committed the crime of manslaughter he might flee to that city and find refuge under certain conditions. Those cities of refuge symbolically represented God’s organization. (Numbers 35:9-34) Now there are millions of persons on earth who desire to do right but who have been unwittingly led into the way against God and His kingdom. Their place of refuge now is to be found only in God’s organization. To that class of persons God through His prophet Zephaniah (chapter two) says: “Before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you . . . seek righteousness, seek meekness ; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” To seek meekness you must hear and learn the truth. To seek righteousness you must obey God’s Word of truth when you hear it. In support of this scripture, Jesus says to all persons who love righteousness to now “flee into the mountains”, and thus take refuge in the organization of Jehovah God.—Matt. 24:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who are preserved and pass through the great universal war will be the ones first in line for the blessings which God will administer to the peoples on earth. Such blessings will include peace on earth and good will toward men. Wars will be forgotten for ever. Health and strength will be given to the people, and they shall dwell together in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">joy and contentment. </span><span class="font10">Among the greatest blessings to be bestowed upon man is everlasting life, the gracious gift of God through Christ Jesus. (Romans 6:23) God made the earth to be inhabited by righteous men, and under the reign of Christ the people will dwell in their homes in complete happiness and live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The present governments of this world cannot bring to you the blessings of life and happiness. Why, then, should you longer stand in jeopardy J When you see the most terrible storm of all time rapidly approaching, why not break away from the cruel and oppressive things of this world, and flee to the kingdom of God and find safety by taking your stand wholly on the side of God and His kingdom?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>If This Be Sedition!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Now you can see why Satan has put it into the minds of earthly officials to charge faithful followers of Christ with the crime of sedition. To be sure, the message of truth speaks deliverance and blessing for the nations, and these truths stir the people with zeal for that universal government of righteousness. Jehovah, the Almighty God, has commissioned His witnesses and commanded them to declare these truths, and they must do it. If the conclusion is that the proclamation of these great and eternal truths constitutes sedition, then let the Devil and his earthly representatives make the most of it. By the grace of Almighty God His witnesses will remain faithful and true to Him and continue to declare His message of truth until He says it is enough!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Honest persons desire to see peace on earth and good will toward men, prosperity, happiness and life everlasting. It is only God’s Word of truth that shows the people how these blessings can come. Therefore Jehovah has made provision that men shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth. When God’s kingdom is in full sway and wickedness for ever gone, then will truly apply the words of Jehovah by His prophet, to wit (Psalm 85:10-12): “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The time has come when there is no middle ground to take. Every person on the earth will, within a very short time, be either on the side of the Devil and his organization or on the side of God and His kingdom. It is God’s kingdom, and it alone, that can and will set you free and bring you the blessings you desire. Those who put their trust in God He will protect. Let every person who loves righteousness and who desires to see on this earth a government of righteousness and everlasting peace now take his stand on the side of God and His kingdom and so indicate by standing and shouting, Aye!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“I have heard Judge Rutherford’s record programs and also in person over radio station KTSA and am deeply and earnestly interested. I want, more than anything, to have a perfect understanding of this all-important subject and shall appreciate any help you may be able to give me . . . and ask that you send me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s talk which was delivered from California, Sunday, January 13.” Mrs. C. R., San Antonio, Tex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Please send me three [copies] of the knockout address Universal War Near’. ... I sincerely thank the Lord for knowledge and understanding of His Word.” Mrs. W. McM., Flushing, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Having heard a number of your very excellent addresses on radio, the one last Sunday, January 13, was about the best of all. Would appreciate if you would send me a copy of the same. ... It is no doubt a most amazing day in which we live and it is a very noble work you are doing in enlightening the masses as to the inevitable result of the present system of political and economic trends toward utter chaos.” T. T. H., Chevy Chase, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Your lecture of this date heard over KWK, and I was greatly impressed, even thrilled. . . . I beg of you to forward a copy to me. I am permitted to lecture occasionally in my own church and shall of a certainty pass this truth on to them. By reading over your lecture I may absorb a bit of your eloquence and impressiveness.” L. J. B., St. Louis, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I am sending for the lecture Universal War Near’, delivered by Judge Rutherford last Sunday. I never heard such a wonderful lecture in my life, such an array of Scripture woven together. . . .” Mrs. G. W. E., Pittsburg, Kans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Today I listened to Judge Rutherford’s fifteen-minute electrical transcription over KTSA, San Antonio, Texas, and again his one-hour lecture in person from Los Angeles, and thought they were wonderful, especially the personal lecture from Los Angeles.” C. B. M., Yoakum, Tex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I am sure the viewpoint expressed by you on the Bible and conditions in general are the sentiments of a great number of people who are really honest with themselves and others, and who are not afraid to face the facts as they really exist.” I. L. R., Norristown, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“To my mind it is the most instructive spiritual and Biblical talk on the air. I never saw the speaker and do not know intimately any of the witnesses of Jehovah, but I know truth when it is so plainly put.” Mrs. M. I., Boothwyn, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“In this little isolated town in the Ozark hills we were able to get all of Judge Rutherford’s talk on Universal War Near<sup>5</sup>. We tuned in on our nearest station KWK, St. Louis, Mo. We could hardly wait for 11:30 a.m., so anxious were we to hear these great truths explained.” Mrs. C. E. P. and Mrs. W. R., Centerville, Mo.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Free Speech for All Broadcasters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">TpREQUENTLY those who try to please every-J- body succeed in pleasing nobody. In fact, that may be taken as a fairly constant rule. A year or so ago a number of radio stations were stampeded into excluding Judge Rutherford from their programs at the behest of Catholic priests. These priests came to them with certain statements which the unw<sup>T</sup>ary radio managers took at face value; a most injudicious step. A little knowledge of priestly tactics would have enabled them to see through the scheme of these priests, which was to accomplish their own ends regardless of the means. The priests claimed to represent a substantial section of the public. As a matter of fact, their influence, even among intelligent Catholics, is definitely limited. True, there is always a modicum of priest-controlled people who will write letters, publish statements, and otherwise make a loud noise, but it soon becomes evident that the furor spends itself quickly and no real harm has been done. Radio stations could have weathered the storm of the protests of an inflamed Catholic minority without serious difficulty. They might have felt the pinch of boycott for a brief space, but would have emerged stronger than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Roy L. Albertson, of WEBR, seems to have arrived at some such conclusion. He is fairly well balanced, even though his characterization of Judge Rutherford’s talks as “full of hell and brimstone” is not strictly correct. Probably he meant to say that there was considerable “blood and thunder” in Judge Rutherford’s talks. Anyway, his letter to the American Broadcasting System will be of interest to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> readers. The attitude revealed by the accompanying letter is the common-sense attitude, one which other station managers are beginning to share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">True, there may be a section of the popu'a-tion that does not like Judge Rutherford’s talks. It is certain that there is a large proportion that has no use for Catholic broadcasts. That is not the question to determine, however. Rather it is a question of fairness and freedom of speech. Jehovah’s witnesses would not move a finger to exclude “Coughlin” from the air, regardless of their personal opinion of him and his speeches. They feel that the same rights should be extended to all, and that the Watchtower programs, in which they are particularly interested, should be given equal consideration by station managers to that given to other paid programs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes .We have had several of his transcriptions.While they are full of hell and brimstone they do not seem to have caused any earthquakes around here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Rutherford,above all others,has accused radio of being muzzled insofar as religion is concerned*He should be allowed the freedom of the air just the same as Father Coughlin and other* are exercising it at the present time.

<p><span class="font10">FPHE edict of Nuremberg was issued by the pope in 1524, and decreed that all printed matter should be censored by the magistrates, the object being to check the spread of “Lutheranism”. It was one of the first attempts to interfere with the freedom of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The papacy thrives in darkness and favors suppression of the liberties which are most highly prized in America and which seem to be in great danger of being taken away. Efforts to censor radio, motion pictures and other means of publicity are significant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">WO of Jehovah’s witnesses while distributing in the city of Quebec pamphlets proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom and declaring His judgments against the present unrighteous order of Satan, were arrested and charged with being parties to a seditious conspiracy. The case was heard recently and the jury brought in a verdict of “guilty”. Justice Belleau sentenced them to two months in prison and a fine of $300, or in lieu of the fine a further five months in prison. The case has been appealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus declared concerning His faithful followers living today, “. . . they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake. And it shall turn to you for a testimony.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is interesting and encouraging to note how His words are being fulfilled today, and the close parallel between His experiences and those of His followers. He, for preaching the Kingdom message, was accused by the priests of sedition; so are they. He was arraigned before the court of “justice” by the strong-arm squad; so are they. He was found guilty; so are they. The whole farce in Jesus’ day, as today, was carried on with much pomp and dignity, hut one observing could not help being impressed with the thought that the dignity was that of dignified humbugs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Remember Them Whose Name Is Mud</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star,</span><span class="font10"> under the caption “Our Quarrel with the Foe”, editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Time passes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of every 1,000 people in Canada today, approximately 460 were either not yet born when the Great War ended or were not older than six years; had never, most of them, been to school. These 460 either know nothing at all of the war as an actual experience or have no adequate memory of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, of every 1,000 now living, there are 120 others who were no older than thirteen when the armistice was signed; in a general way they may be said to have, been of public school age at that time. Some of them who lost fathers and brothers have vivid memories of the war’s horrors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But out of the 580 who have been born since the war or were not over thirteen at its elose, it is probably true that about 500 (half of our present population) have no adequate personal knowledge of what the war meant to mankind. A new generation has grown up which knows not war except as war exists upon the printed page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is important that they should be told about it; that Remembrance Day should be not only an occasion for revering the memory of those gallant men whose “name liveth forevermore’’, but an occasion for resolving that the thing must never happen again; that nevermore must the world be plunged into armed conflict.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The general practice is to denounce as a Communist any unemployed man who speaks up for his kind. It is a good thing for the United States and for Canada as well that all those who are denounced as Communists are not Communists but workers distracted by their troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Should a man be content because he is on relief, because he gets his weekly voucher? He can get for his family so much meat, so much bread, so much milk. Should he be glad, happy and grateful? Should he not, rather, long for work and be unhappy until he gets it ? He has known the time when he earned and drew his pay and was an independent citizen. He started to buy a home of his own on the instalment plan and was getting on with it until the bottom fell out of the world through no fault of his own. He had to forfeit the home he was buying—he could not get work and he could not keep up his payments. He had to live, or his family had to do so, so he had to hand his property back and stand in line at the relief office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Should we expect him to be jocular about it ? Is he a Red if he is impatient to be on his own feet again?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is an individualist suffering the agonies of utter defeat. Even if he does, on occasion, use the bitterest language, why not? The world as it is is enough to wring it out of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No greater mistake is made by those in authority than to make a present to the Communists of every</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">man who does not cringe and demean himself when accepting relief as a charity for which he should fall on one knee and thank the giver for a bottle of milk. If he does not do so it does not show that he is a Red. It shows that he is such a man as you. And if you were in his place you would say: “Give us work and we will do it. There being no work we shall, if you do not mind, continue to live.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>To Keep from Starving</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Another striking example of the terrible hardships endured by many in this land of plenty is found in the following from the Calgary </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Albertan:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rimbey was the setting for a scene more pathetic than the most imaginative fiction writer could invent when on Saturday a woman dressed in men’s attire and driving one horse hitched to a two-wheeled gig brought her five children to town to keep them from starvation. The family lives about 50 miles west of Rimbey in the moose country along the Saskatchewan river, beyond the bounds of any municipality, and they have been subsisting on wild fruit, berries and what rabbit meat they could snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It took two days for the party to make the trip through rain and snow and over<sup>1</sup> very bad roads. They were huddled together in a crude box affair on the gig; only covered by old quilts, and their clothing consisted of tattered floursacks and gunny sacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Barefooted and hungry they were received at the Cottage hotel, where they were fed and warmed, and Constable Fordham of the R. C. M. P., who now has the children in charge, saw to it that suitable and sufficient clothing was obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are four boys and a girl, the eldest 10 years of age, and none has ever been to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Travelers through that part of the country report that the home where the family lived had no floor and that these children have run all summer without a stitch of clothing on them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Prison Did Him Good</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Tim Buck, who was sent to the penitentiary three years ago because he believed in Communism, was released a few days ago and given a rousing reception upon his arrival in Toronto, and a few days later 16,000 people jammed the huge Maple Leaf Gardens to hear him speak and thousands were turned away. To the cheering crowds upon his arrival he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A few years ago a premier of Ontario said a few years in prison would do us good. It did do us good. Look at this crowd tonight. And then when I read about the Abitibi scandal I said, all right, Mr. Henry, your words have come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yes, I am glad to get back, glad to fight again against intolerable conditions, the cesspools, the pest houses that infest this province and every other province. I am glad to be with you for a number of reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“After the rest of the gang at the penitentiary had their supper tonight and had gone to bed, I was told to prepare to leave the old grey walls. I was told you wouldn’t have a chance to welcome me. They boasted they were going to beat that gang of bums in Toronto who might want to make a demonstration, by sending me home tonight. So here I am and there you are and I'm glad to be with you. This is how they beat you. Let me say this. I am now ready to fight for you and with you at any time or place.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Rubber Horseshoes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the consideration of ways and means of overcoming unnecessary noises the iron shoes of the horses have been up for discussion, and in this connection the following item appears in the Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rubber horseshoes will entirely replace steel shoes in the future, predicts J. C. Lee, manager of Atlas Drive Calk Co., denying emphatically the suggestion, made at a York township council meeting, that rubber shoes are bad for horses’ health and tended to rot the hoofs in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Lee explained that since modern rubber horseshoes were of conventional open shape, hoofs got plenty of air and consequently would not rot. “Besides being more silent,” he said, “the rubber shoes are only about half as heavy as ordinary steel shoes. You can understand the advantage, therefore, to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">horse which has to go 20 or 30 miles. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Lee added: “One firm in Hamilton put our shoes on a horse that had been wearing steel shoes and had been lame for weeks, and in two or three weeks the hoi*se was cured. The blacksmith praised the rubber shoe for such a cure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Those who opposed the shoes,” he continued, “were sore blacksmiths who feared they would lose their jobs, because a forge was not needed, as the shoes could be adjusted cold. There is little danger of their losing their jobs, however, since someone has to take care of the horses’ feet, trimming them and adjusting the shoes; and many blacksmiths who bitterly opposed the shoe at first are now very much in favor of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">On Carrying Weapons</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an effort to reduce crime a drastic law has been passed pertaining to one’s having in his possession a revolver. Under the caption “Weapons” the Saskatoon </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The amendments to the Criminal Code covering the possession and carrying of revolvers or pistols will go into effect on January 1. It is, therefore, of real importance that owners of such instruments, whether they be effective weapons or souvenirs, should register them with the proper authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The penalty for possession of an unregistered revolver or pistol is rather severe: $50 and costs or 30 days in jail or both. And the good citizen who is in possession of such weapons has no reason for not registering them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the case of persons who have a revolver in their possession during the commission of a crime, whether they use it or not, the penalty will be two years in the penitentiary in addition to the ordinary penalty imposed for the crime itself. That surely will be a deterrent to criminals carrying weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much of the crime which is so prevalent in the United States may be attributed directly to the facility with which weapons may be obtained and kept. There anyone ean have a pistol, and the possession of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">pistol too often leads to its use. If the United States could eliminate the possession of weapons it would be a tremendous step in the conquest of crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The practice of owning and carrying weapons has never gained much ground in Canada. Nevertheless, every year there are crimes in which the possession of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">revolver has led to its use.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Result of Depression</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Due to the economic depression in Canada as elsewhere farm buildings and agricultural machinery have gotten into a very bad state of repair, particularly so in western Canada, where in the province of Saskatchewan alone it is estimated it will require $140,000,000 to restore them to a proper condition. Commenting upon an address by Professor Hope the Saskatoon </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Extent to which the return of industrial prosperity awaits the recovery of agriculture is indicated from some figures given Friday by Professor E. C. Hope, of the department of farm management of the University of Saskatchewan, after a study of rural surveys made by that department. To restore to the condition of 1929 the buildings, farm machinery, household equipment and clothing of the dwellers on the 136,000 farms in Saskatchewan would take a sum of at least $140,000,000, his figures show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past four years buildings have gone unpainted and unrepaired, machinery has been used that was ready for the scrap heap, the normal expenditure on household furnishings has been cut to a fraction, and the stock of clothing has been greatly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The farm buildings in Saskatchewan were worth $236,000,000. Professor Hope puts the wear and tear not replaced at $50,000,000. It would cost that sum to put the buildings in the same state as in 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the depression the districts surveyed had an equipment of farm machinery running from $2,000 to $3,000 per farm. This machinery is four years older. Little has been replaced, and repairs have been cut to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">minimum. It would cost $40,000,000 to put it back in shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The internal fittings of the homes have also depreciated. At Kindersley the farmers used to spend $60 a year in replacements, and in the Turtleford district, $48. It would need some $20,000,000 to bring the home furnishings back to par.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Kindersley district the farmers used to spend $157 per farm each year for clothing, and in the Turtleford district, $164. Recent surveys show the expenditure cut to a figure that cannot replace wear and tear. Some $30,000,000 would be needed to bring back the wardrobe to the pre-depression state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These estimates do not include the replacement of the automobiles now pulled by horses or the worn-out trucks.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Beriberi and Whole Wheat?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The following is a Canadian Press report from Newfoundland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Staggered by estimates that 25 percent of the people in Newfoundland were on the dole last winter and that 20 percent will be dependent during the next few months, doctors of the outposts have their backs to the wall in a valiant battle with beriberi, dreaded disease that stalks in the wake of poverty and cripples many of its victims so they cannot return to work when jobs are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Repeated visitations of the disease in villages where most of the fisherfolk are existing on rations equaling $1.80 a month have left the human stock deteriorated physically, mentally and morally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some hope is found in return of the island to the status of a crown colony under the wing of Great Britain, but in the opinion of Dr. C. F. Parsons, superintendent of the Notre Dame Bay memorial hospital, economic rehabilitation of the country must await restoration of its people to health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Parsons explains that beriberi is found in people who live on a highly restricted diet “such as the dole diet”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He finds a reliable remedy and preventive in wholewheat flour, and service clubs in St. John’s are endeavoring to supply as much as their means permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But some northern outposts are isolated for the winter. In these spring will find youths tottering or crawling. Many of the aged will have been buried.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Strangest Job</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Under the heading “Overhauls Ovens in 300-Degree Heat and Toils on Roofs at 15 Below Zero” the Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font10"> reports the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Louis Green is Toronto’s number one claimant for the “strangest job” title. Mr. Green makes an honest living by going into bakers’ ovens, at temperatures which range up to 300 degrees, and repairing them. He has given his life to the study of chimneys and such, and for twenty years has done work that would scorch the eyebrows off an ordinary mortal. About 35 years Old, he lives on Major street, with a wife and five children, one of whom, he hopes, will follow in his footsteps as a human piece of asbestos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I work in ice plants, too,” he admitted, but though his real life work was connected with fire-breathing ovens, cold does not bother him. Recently a liquor store heating plant ceased to function. Louis went down and fixed up the chimney, sitting on top of a roof at 15 degrees below zero to do it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Change, but No Improvement</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Indicative of public unrest and dissatisfaction with the existing condition of affairs was the outcome of the provincial elections in Ontario and Saskatchewan. Speaking thereof editorially the Edmonton </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The provincial elections held yesterday in Ontario and Saskatchewan resulted in landslides for which there are few precedents in Canadian history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ontario a government which elected 91 members out of 112 in 1929, was yesterday so decisively defeated that on election night it seemed Premier Henry might be the sole survivor of his cabinet, this only by grace of five other candidates who split the opposing votes, and with a following no larger than the usual party contingent on one of the committees of the legislature. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Saskatchewan the Anderson government suffered even worse, the premier himself being numbered among the casualties, and his party left without a single member in the new legislature. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only one interpretation can be placed on these two simultaneous outbursts of public opinion. The people of Canada are in revolt against the inaction that has allowed deflation to sweep the land like a destroying storm, and heartsick of being admonished to tighten their belts, keep faith in &quot;sound” money, revere their deluded grandfathers, and suffer want in the midst of plenty for the sake of their beloved but mueh-abused country. They have had all they want, and all they intend to stand for, in the way of blasted markets, doles, and the paying of public debts over and over by each successive generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spending the People’s Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the caption “Their Own Money” the Saskatoon </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font10"> editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a tendency on the part of governments seeking re-election to speak of money spent on relief as though it were something given by that particular government as a result of the generous instincts of the party which is seeking a return to office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Figures and statistics roll impressively from the tongue of speakers. The government has spent so many millions of dollars, they say, for the aid of so many thousands of individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They never suggest that the people of Canada have spent so many millions of dollars for the aid of those less fortunate residents of the country. Nevertheless, that is exactly what has been and is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Expenditure for relief is simply money provided by all residents of the Dominion, including those who receive relief, for eventually they will have to share in paying the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The part played by the government in the transaction is simply that of a clerk or agent or bookkeeper who keeps the tally and measures out the funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same category comes money being spent on public works. If $750,000 is spent on roads it is money provided by those who pay the taxes, and that means everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ontario there is a vast outpouring of public money on a gigantic work program. It runs into many millions and makes the amount being spent in Saskatchewan look comparatively small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Time was when such expenditures and claims for credit for its expenditure successfully fooled the electorate. But after the last four years, during which such matters have undergone a close public scrutiny, it is hardly possible that anyone fails to recognize this type of spending as a case of trying to buy the public with its own money.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Shake Hands with William R. Watson</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A Canadian Press report from Montreal tells of one overcoming great odds in the battle of life. We quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the story of a conquest over almost unbelievable odds—of a man who has been without arms and hands since birth, yet who shaves, writes perfectly, does a hundred things. All with his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is William R. Watson of Edmonton, in Montreal to attend the convention of the International Society for Crippled Children. He wants to see established in Canada vocational training schools for handicapped children. That is his aim in life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You couldn’t help admiring and liking Mr. Watson —from the time you enter his room and see him extend a toe for you to grasp, with the words, &quot;Shake hands with me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You see him open a brief case with his feet, reach in and sort among some papers. You see him pick up a hair brush and brush his hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At 30 years of age, William Watson has conquered lis handicaps, not the least of which was self-consciousness at appearing in public and using his feet as hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He was graduated in arts and law from the University of Alberta after taking his lectures down by writing with his mouth, an accomplishment he has mastered equally well as writing with his feet. He learned to swim, to ride, to eat with his feet. He calls foot-writing * ‘ pedescript ”. He skis and plays bridge, using a ledger for his cards at his end of the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To his mother he gives the credit. His mother, he said, has been the driving force behind his accomplishments.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Freedom of the Press in Peril</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font10">HARGING that the administration intends to establish a censored news service, Senator Schall, of Minnesota, said: “The censored news service will have the inside track on all government news and will be available to all newspapers willing to print news colored to the satisfaction of President Roosevelt. Plans are now being made to join all foreign radio stations in the news service so that the Roosevelt news service will have full coverage of all foreign news.... Secretaries Wallace and Tugwell are said to have had a large part in working out this new plan to censor the press by this new ‘club’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Elisha Hanson, Washington attorney for the American Newspaper Publishers’ Association, said: “There is great danger that, unless publishers are alert, your only news about Washington will be just that news which the administration wants you ~to have, supplied to you by official agencies, charged with the responsibility of bottling up all sources and preventing the dissemination of any information other than that officially sponsored.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Both the president and Postmaster Farley deny these charges, but in view of the influence of the Catholic hierarchy in governmental affairs, and in further consideration of the history of the ‘unchanging church’, they are very probably true. Senator Schall was not at all disturbed by the denials, but went a little further by adding that the administration planned to establish a censored radio press service under the cloak of a private corporation, but will support it through the Public Works Administration. All this uncensored talk by Senator Schall and others must be highly annoying to those who would like to put a muzzle on channels of information, but it seems to libertylovers that it is something to be thankful for that there are still some men in Washington and elsewhere who are not afraid to talk out and tell the people what they have a right to know.</span></p>

During the war he had been in the navy and suffered from exposure. Tuberculosis had developed, and he had been treated at a naval hospital. The cough returned a few months after he was discharged from the hospital, and he was soon back again for more treatments. He became addicted to narcotics as a result. His troubles affected his mind, and he did not get along very well, even though he had a small pension. Then it happened that he was arrested for burglary of a drug store. He had to have his morphine. Sent to jail, he got into trouble with the officials; he does not remember why. But he was confined in a small cell, and for several months lived on bread and water. He said he didn’t want anything else. He didn’t want his hair cut either, so his beard and hair grew long. Sitting on the edge of his cot in the dim, dingy cell, he seemed more a figure of the Dark Ages than of the twentieth century. But it was the twentieth century, and the jail in which Charley was confined was The Walls, at Huntsville, Tex. He is now in a veterans’ hospital, through the efforts put forth by a veterans’ organization which learned of this case of stupidity and cruelty inflicted upon an irresponsible victim by representatives of the law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Art of Sleeping When You. Wish To</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE Vienna physician, Dr. Robicsek, recommends breathing exercises which are supposed to make it possible to overcome the most stubborn cases of insomnia. They are quite simple:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lie down, and first relax every muscle of the body, beginning with the feet, and gradually every other muscle of the legs, the abdomen and the chest, the arms and hands, the neck, and finally of the face and the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While doing this, exhale without any restraint, letting out all your breath, as it were ^groaning”, and let yourself go completely, relax fully and, so to speak, collapse into yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now there follows a pause; remain thus, completely relaxed, until the desire to inhale asserts itself, which desire must be gratified. But now you inhale differently from usual. Breathe only with the abdomen; leave the position and condition of the chest as acquired by the exhaling process, unchanged. The chest remains drawn in and one breathes by expanding the abdomen (which in the meantime has relaxed) until the lungs are again sufficiently filled with air. Inhale slowly, evenly, sort of stealthily and sipping-like. Now, hold your breath briefly (a short pause in breathing), and at the same moment a strong desire to yawn (as a reflex) automatically is felt, which is the symptom of approaching sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If all this is repeated again and again while the body is completely relaxed in a comfortable position, one just naturally slips off to sleep after only a few minutes, without any further aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This method has proved effective also in cases of sleeplessness due to external causes, such as pain and noise. It fails only after stimulants, such as coffee; however, the person suffering from insomnia will, of course, avoid exciting, agitating drinks in the evening.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">To have clothes beautifully white, slice an unpeeled lemon into the water when boiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lemon juice with olive oil is far superior to vinegar for salads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Application of lemon juice to insect bites reduces the irritation.</span></p>

The cooler is made in this way: Take four pieces of 2&quot; x 4&quot; for the legs, and 1&quot; x 12&quot; common lumber for the shelves. With these construct a sort of cupboard or table, having the board on top flush with the legs. Then, for the sides, take sheets of cloth of one thickness and tack on three sides of this cooler, tacking the fourth side at the top only, so that it may serve as a door. The one I made is about 3 feet high by 16 inches wide and 2 feet long, and has three shelves. On top of the cupboard place a pan or bucket of water, putting a good-sized piece of white goods of any land in the bucket of water and allowing it to hang over onto the cloth tacked on the cooler. Set the cooler out in the shade where the open air may circulate around it. The cloth in the bucket will seep up the water, making it necessary to refill the bucket from time to time. The air blowing through the wet cloth around the sides of the cooler makes it cool inside.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">HILE out in the work this summer I witnessed to L. A. H----, in C----, Vt., and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">placed some literature with him. After I had finished he asked me to step out into his garden, as he had something he wanted to show me. I did so, and found out something that I think will be of interest to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The gardens in that section of Vermont were pretty well cleaned out by the drought and insects, but he had as nice a vegetable garden as I have seen for some time. Everything was covered with a white powder, but the plants were all healthy, with no sign of insects or disease of any kind, with vegetables of more than ordinary size. There was no sign of borers in the corn or squash vines, nor was there a weed in sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He told me that fifteen years ago he bought the place and had had the garden in the same spot every year. When he bought it everyone laughed at him and said he would starve to death trying to raise anything there, as no one else had ever been able to. This proved an interesting statement; so I looked for information as to how it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The white powder proved to be talc, and nothing else. He informed me that that was all that he used. No manure or fertilizer of any kind. He covered the ground with it in the spring, and kept the plants covered while growing. He claims that the flavor is ’way ahead of vegetables raised any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His contention is that the talc draws the nitrogen and moisture out of the air; but whether it does or not, we will have to admit that he gets the vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I was also taken out into the cow bam, and there I saw the nicest-looking herd of cows I have ever seen, with not a trace of cow-barn odor. All nice and clean, and the floor was covered with talc to produce the results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10">LFALFA is not something new. It was cultivated in Greece as early as 400 B.C. and has always been much appreciated by the Arabs. They called it </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">alfafa,</span><span class="font10"> which means “father of all foods”. It has been grown in America for seventy-five years and is considered </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font10"> food for cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Alfalfa roots have been known to penetrate the soil to a depth of 125 feet. It is a legume, like peas or beans, and its stems have been known to reach a length of fifty feet. The deep rootage brings to the plant ten times as much of the valuable minerals as is found in the grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An analysis of the mineral ash Qf alfalfa shows the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Calcium (lime) ...................... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„...34.90</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dietitians claim that potassium is the elixir of life, and the claims made for alfalfa tea seem to suggest that they are not far away in their calculations. Tea made from alfalfa leaves has a bitter taste, but causes increased secretion of the kidneys, increased peristaltic action of the bowels, increased appetite, increased assimilation of foods, and increased weight. A large drink produces a sensation of warmth in the stomach, and a good night’s rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For years it has been known that cattle and horses grow better if given some alfalfa every day along with their hay and grain. An experiment was made in Kansas with fourteen little pigs. Seven of them, fed on corn alone, averaged 75 pounds apiece in 180 days. The other seven, fed on corn and alfalfa hay, averaged 185 pounds apiece in the same time. In the alfalfa-fed hogs the bones were twice as large and three times as strong, and the muscles were firmer and less fat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The famous dietitian Dr. Frank McCoy says: “For several years I have been advising my patients to eat alfalfa, if they could get it fresh, as it makes a very delicious salad or addition to a combination salad.” A noted dentist said: “Alfalfa is especially rich in vitamins and minerals which are important in keeping the teeth firm and strong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Government Bulletin No. 247 says: “The results show that 90% of the potassium, 85% of the magnesium, 75% of the phosphorus, 50% of the nitrogen and 40% of the calcium (lime) contained in the dried alfalfa plant are soluble in water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who have used alfalfa claim wonderful results in cases of lumbago, rheumatism, hardening of the arteries, tuberculosis, dropsy, bladder trouble, prostatitis, blood disorders, and all those other troubles whose name is legion, which start in the intestines, where all diseases start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Luther Burbank once said: “Alfalfa is a vastly different thing from ordinary hay as people usually think of it. It contains some of the most important nutritive substances known, and in greater abundance, the salts, so especially important in the nourishment of human [creatures], especially children, such as potassium, sodium, magnesium and the phosphates and sulphates.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A boarding-house keeper tried alfalfa tea on her boarders. They drank it without comment, noticing no difference in the taste of the new tea, but in a few days their appetite had increased prodigiously. The tea was good for the boarders, but hard on the landlady’s larder. As a milk-producer and general tonic in maternity cases, alfalfa tea, according to the statement of a prominent physician, F. L. Wilson, is practically infallible.</span></p>

Oliver Wendell Holmes was for thirtyseven years professor of anatomy in Harvard University, and on page 260 of his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Essays,</span><span class="font10"> he says: “The disgrace of medicine has been that colossal system of self-deception, in obedience to which mines have been emptied of their cankering minerals, the vegetable kingdom robbed of all its noxious growths, the entrails of animals taxed for their impurities, the poison bags of reptiles drained of their venom, and all the inconceivable abominations thus obtained thrust down the throats of human [creatures].”</span></p>

It was a long stream of color, in which were mingled the white and black of surplice and cassock, the violet of monsignori’s robes, the red of the cardinal’s attire, jeweled decorations flashing from the uniforms of Papal Knights, and the somber brown of monks’ robes, girded with rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This reminds us of a parade of unemployed recently seen not far from the East Side the cardinal has left behind, except that there were no violet robes, red skirts, jeweled decorations or flashing uniforms, but only the somber drab of worn-out clothing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Theologians Endorse Evolution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N THEIR eagerness to back the Devil in his opposition to Jehovah God theologians of Canadian colleges were willing to support educationists in Nova Scotia who approved books containing references to evolution. Rev. Dr. F. H. Cosgrave, provost of Trinity College, said: “I know the book well. It is a splendid book—• very well written.” The book referred to was </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Times,</span><span class="font10"> by Brestedt, containing references to man’s supposed descent from some form of mammal the ancestor of which was also the ancestor of the ape. Rev. Dr. S. A. B. Mercer, lecturer in “religious knowledge”, as well as Rev. Dr. T. Eakin, principal of Knox College, likewise endorsed the books which assume the correctness of the evolution theory. Rev. K. H. Cousland also thinks evolution is O.K. Monsignor Frank Carroll, Roman Catholic authority, said: “There are two forms of scientific evolution, the absolute, or material, and a modified form. The latter is not condemned by the Catholic church, and there is no clash between it and the account of creation in Genesis. Modified evolutiqn means that lower forms of life could be raised, not by the unaided physical forces of nature, but by the providence of God; and this process could be continued to the very body of Adam, to which a created spiritual soul was added by God’s creative act. This theory is merely tolerated in the sense that it has never been condemned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to even consider the diabolical doctrine of evolution as worthy of refutation. Its direct contradiction of the entire tenor of the Holy Scriptures makes a detailed discussion of it an act of dishonoring the Creator, whose laws of justice and harmony are flagrantly ignored and reproached in the devilish evolution theory.

They will not stultify themselves or dignify the foolishness of the clergy by listening to them. The theologian may be sincere, but he could not possibly have any competent evidence in support of the astounding evolution theory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Americans are giving much aid and support to the poor suffering Poles. We are now wondering whether we will ever hear of the pope’s giving anything ... who takes vast sums of money through the “Rome penny” collections! Maybe he will send the destitute and flood-stricken people another candle with his blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>“Jehu” in the Pacific</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font10">OUTH AMERICA is Roman Catholic. Indeed, it is so thoroughly Roman Catholic that it has newspapers which carry cartoons of the papal priesthood which would never be tolerated in the United States, where even a candid discussion of the papal system and its practices in the light of the Scriptures results in radio lecturers’ being banned from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the newspapers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A Lanterna,</span><span class="font10"> a journal which seeks to “combat clericalism”, has cartoons picturing a priest and a pig, the same in outline, the obvious lesson being that a priest is nothing but a pig and that, of the two, the latter is the more to be respected. Another picture shows a priest driving a man who pulls the cart on which the priest rides with a nun sitting with her feet down the back. The nun evidently* anticipates maternity at a not-far-off date. Still another illustration shows a woman sweeping into a dustpan a collection of rosaries, “prayer” books, medals, priestly equipment and other “religious” goods. Priests are pictured with repulsively hideous faces, which they hide behind a mask of sanctimoniousness. Should. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> reproduce pictures such as these there is no telling what might happen. It does not want its readers to suffer from nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, South America knows her priesthood, but it is almost entirely ignorant of Jehovah God and His gracious purposes. So Paul Mann, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, decided to go to South America and tell the people of the goodness of God and the blessings of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Quite without the thought of doing anything spectacular, he decided to go by boat, and to be his own captain, taking his family of wife and four children and trusting in Jehovah to guide him safely along the coast from California to his destination. So he got the boat, equipped it with a small Diesel engine and the necessary provisions and furnishings and made ready to go. But when his intentions became known he was warned that it was a most hazardous undertaking to make the trip and that it was a matter of committing suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But, having been permitted to go as far as he had, Paul concluded that there was no reason why he should not carry out his original plan, and that Jehovah would see him through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The papers and movies took an interest in the matter. When the party made ready to depart many pictures were taken both for the press and for the screen, and Paul so maneuvered his boat as to bring the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” into prominence, as well as the name of the boat, “Jehu.”' The news of the “foolhardy” undertaking was published all over the United States. Moving pictures were shown in thousands of theaters, and Inevitably the name of Jehovah was coupled with the proposed journey. Here was one of Jehovah’s witnesses going forth “not knowing whither he went”, though having in mind a definite destination. No doubt, Satan, back of the scenes, permitted the wide publicity with a view to bringing discredit upon the “visionary” Paul, and thus also upon the name of Jehovah, certain that the trip would end in disaster. The Devil would undoubtedly have been pleased to send the boat with its passengers and cargo to the bottom. As Satan stirred up the sea of Galilee in an effort to engulf the Master, so he sought to raise storms to overturn the “Jehu”. Once as the travelers were about to anchor for a rest a heavy storm seemed to come from nowhere, striking the side of the little ship with such force that it seemed the end had come. But the boat survived. Later a great fish leaped over the boat and did its bit to add to the “terrors of the deep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the trip, for all its hazards, was successfully negotiated from Los Angeles to Panama, a distance of well over 3,500 miles. From this point the journey was continued by means of regular passenger service, the “Jehu” being sold, for it had become clear that it was not sufficiently seaworthy to continue the trip through the Atlantic. Faith in Jehovah does not justify one in disregarding ordinary caution, but God is pleased to honor the faith of His people, even when it appears to others that they fail to exercise sufficient care for their own safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The story of the “Jehu” accompanied the group, and wherever they went the name “Jehovah” was noted with interest, and the message, which was given courteous hearing. Newspapers in the cities to which the travelers came gave publicity to the venture, saying, “Jehovah Was with Paul Mann as He Sailed down the Pacific Coast.” The greatest of all names was read by thousands who had never before heard it spoken or seen it written. Jehovah’s pioneer witness followed up the interest aroused and told the good news of the coming Kingdom of justice and truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font8"> and Plainfield Police Rebuked</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the public interest, the Governor of New Jersey was served personally on yesterday by Jehovah’s witnesses with a copy of a letter delivered on Wednesday to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Police Reporter</span><span class="font8"> of New Jersey. That magazine, edited by P. J. Siccardi, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, carried in its issue of last November an advertisement<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark155">1</a></sup> furnished and paid for by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On last Saturday a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Police Reporter </span><span class="font8">containing the advertisement mentioned was delivered individually to each member of the Plainfield police force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Plainfield </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font8"> was invited to reproduce that advertisement in its issue of January 12, 1935, so that all the people of the community might have the benefit of the information. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News </span><span class="font8">refused to publish the advertisement, even as paid copy, announcing that its ‘censorship board’ had decided that the advertisement contained information not fit for the people to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses firmly believe that fair-minded persons of Plainfield and other communities will agree that the people of this country are entitled to the opportunity to exercise their right to receive and judge for themselves what is fit for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LETTER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peoples Pulpit Association</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">124 Columbia Heights Brooklyn, New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">January 16, 1935</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Police Reporter</span><span class="font8"> of New Jersey, Attention P. J. Siccardi, President, International Association of Chiefs of Police, Hackensack, N.J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sirs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the November 1934 issue of your journal, at page 3, appears an advertisement entitled JEHOVAH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That advertisement, solicited on behalf of your organization through its business director, was furnished by Judge Rutherford, president of this association, and was paid for at your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The advertisement sets forth in plain language the position of men and women who, as Jehovah’s witnesses, are sincerely and earnestly worshiping Almighty God in humble obedience to His commandment, and doing good unto the people throughout New Jersey and other communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To all officials and officers who receive your journal that advertisement is notice as to the character of men with whom they are dealing in arresting Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is also notice to such officials and officers that they are working against that which Almighty God has commanded shall be done at this time among the people of all nations by His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To proceed to arrest men and women for testifying about the Kingdom of Almighty God after being thus notified is a direct insult to the Most High God and His Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The grossness of this insult to the Lord is enhanced by the fact that police Officers will listen to and act upon the suggestion of clergymen who are moved by malice and wicked hatred toward Jehovah’s witnesses. Have in mind, as an example, that one who will use concerning Jehovah’s witnesses language such as that of a clergyman (who is also chaplain of the local police department, as I am informed) in counseling the Paterson recorder, to wit, ‘Put the screws on them tight,’ shows that he has murder in his heart. He has a heart regardless of social duty to his fellow creature, and his motive is fatally bent on doing wrong to others. When police officials and officers act at the behest of such vicious and malicious men they put themselves in an exceedingly dangerous position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford instructs me to say that he authorized the copy for the advertisement in utmost good faith, hoping that the police would see our position and take a reasonable course. He was willing to pay a large price for the advertising space in your journal, not to influence the police, but for an opportunity of serving notice as to the exact facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the light of the persistent actions of the police toward Jehovah’s witnesses (as described in my letters to your business director under date of December 19, 1934, and December 28, 1934, and also the fresh arrests made in Plainfield on January 13, 1935), Judge Rutherford deems it not only useless but cooperating with mockery to furnish further copy even if it were published free in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Police Reporter,</span><span class="font8"> when the effect of publishing copy already supplied seems to be to cause spineless policemen to act at the behest of malicious men in utter disregard of what is right and just.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shall we indulge the presumption that the clergy and the police whom they can control mean that “this is war to the hilt”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If so, then take further notice now that Jehovah’s witnesses, by the grace of the Almighty God ‘whose name alone is JEHOVAH’, will receive with joy whatever comes, trusting in the Most High God whom we serve to deliver us in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our first and highest duty is to obey the commandments of Jehovah God. This we will do, by His grace. In doing this we are not lawbreakers in any sense. We are not such as police should have to give their attention to. We are doing injury to no one, but endeavoring, sincerely and openly, to do good unto all people. If we are still made the objects of vicious and malicious persecution because we are doing right, then those who induce policemen to take such action against us, as well as the policemen themselves, must bear the responsibility before God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Probably some of the police organization laughed up their sleeves when they got $200 for that page of advertising, saying in substance: ‘The dupes are willing to give up their money, but we will take it and still go after them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You aro reminded that, at the time, Judge Rutherford informed your representative that he would not spend a penny to influence the police, but that he would spend some money to let them know the truth. He has done so. Now let the responsibility rest where it ought to rest. We have carried out our part faithfully and truly, and leave the result with the God whom we serve and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The police will never be heard to say anywhere thait they acted ignorantly concerning the facts when they continue to arrest and imprison Jehovah’s witnesses. The laws of this land hold a man responsible for his acts even though he is ignorant of the law. The law of God does not hold a man responsible until he has notice. Now the policemen of New Jersey have received full and fair notice and the responsibility is not to man but to Jehovah God, and be assured that He will administer the recompense in His own due time and good way. Now there is not a policemen in New Jersey but that knows that every time one of Jehovah’s witnesses is arrested he, the policeman, is exceeding his legal authority and acting at the behest of a malicious class of men who hypocritically pose as the representatives of a Christian people but who are really the diabolical agents of the Devil himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, take notice that every police officer in. attempting to hinder the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, whether he does so on his own initiative or by direction of his superior, acts clearly in flagrant violation of both the spirit and the letter of the definitely restrictive provision of the basic law of New Jersey, namely, that “No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshiping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience. ’ ’</span></p>

This book bears the name JEHOVAH, and that name JEHOVAH means Almighty God’s purpose toward His creatures.

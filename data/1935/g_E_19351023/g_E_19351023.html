<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">The Associated Press Cowardly and Unfair</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">rpHE Associated Press is afraid to tell the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font11">truth regarding the flag-saluting incident at Lynn, Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press does not want the people to know that the United States has been officially declared to be a Christian nation and that therefore in this country God’s law, by express pronouncement of the highest court in the land, is above man’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press does not want known the act of the United States Senate by which the nation’s highest lawmaking body officially consented to flying the flag of the pope above the stars and stripes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It does not wish the people to know President Roosevelt has agreed to have a representative from the Vatican received here as ambassador and to have this country represented by an ambassador at Vatican City as soon as public opinion can be brought to see such relations to be acceptable to the country’s plain people.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press especially fears to mention that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy backs a vast scheme to grab the government of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press has no interest in giving publicity to the speech of a man who has the courage to tell the truth on a subject of vital interest to every school child and every parent in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Hitler-minded politicians and fanatics in Massachusetts imposed upon that state’s teachers an unnecessary requirement which was adverse to public interest and adverse to keeping the United States flag in its proper place in the minds of children and grown-ups of that state and the nation, and when an eight-year-old American boy of good parentage, and himself an excellent child, refused to be forced to do something contrary to his conscience and not necessary to his education, The Associated Press quickly saw the news value of the incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The morning after, it sent all over the United States the story of the boy, the teacher and the flag at Lynn, coupled with information that the boy was a son of one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Associated Press seized the chance to put Jehovah’s witnesses to the test in the eyes of the whole American people. At seven p.m. Tuesday, October 1, it sought a statement from Judge Rutherford, spokesman for Jehovah’s witnesses, and president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It desired a verbal statement and was told the statement in writing would be ready the next morning. The next day passed without anybody’s calling for the statement. That evening another telephone call was received, and The Associated Press refused to agree to accept the statement unless released from the promise that it must be used exactly as given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Meantime Judge Rutherford decided to broadcast the statement so that millions on the Atlantic seaboard interested in this important question might have their reasonable and proper desires gratified. The Associated Press asked when the statement could be had and was told it would be ready Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning between eight and ten. No further effort was made by The Associated Press to obtain the statement, word probably having gone out from the higher-ups that it contained too much truth to be made public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Meantime also the Boston </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font11"> insisted on being given the statement for publication. That paper was told the statement would be given out S6 immediately after the broadcast, provided the paper would agree to publish it exactly as broadcast. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font11"> agreed, received the copy of the speech, but published not a word, nor did The Associated Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> considers it a grand privilege to be able to present in this issue the address, which immediately follows, word for word as broadcast Sunday morning October 6 on a chain of fourteen stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Saluting a Flag</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[Broadcast over chain Sunday, October C, 1935, by Judge Rutherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">R</span><span class="font11">ECENTLY much publicity has been given to the case of Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., a schoolboy of tender years, who declined to salute the American flag and sing ‘’America”. He is the son of one of Jehovah's witnesses. The Associated Press has requested me to express my view of the matter. This I do from the standpoint of a true follower of Christ Jesus. To many persons the saluting of the flag is merely a formalism and has little or no significance. To those who sincerely consider it from the Scriptural standpoint, it means much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The flag representatively stands for the visible ruling powers. To attempt by law to compel a citizen or child of a citizen to salute any object or thing, or to sing so-called “patriotic songs”, is entirely unfair and wrong. Laws are made and enforced to prevent the commission of overt acts that result in injury to another, and are not made for the purpose of compelling a person to violate his conscience, and particularly when that conscience is directed in harmony with Jehovah God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The refusal to salute the flag, and to stand mute, as this boy did, could injure no one. If one sincerely believes that God’s commandment is against the saluting of flags, then to compel that person to salute a flag contrary to the Word of God, and contrary to his conscience, works a great injury to that person. The State has no right by law or otherwise to work injury to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For many centuries Satan the Devil has been the invisible ruler of the nations of the earth. God has suffered or permitted him to so act in order to put a test upon the human race to determine how many will serve God willingly and how many will serve the Devil. For that reason Jehovah God gives this commandment to those who will receive His favor (Exodus 20:3,5): “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the third chapter of Daniel the Divine Record states that in violation of God's law the government of Babylon made a law commanding all persons, when the national hymn was played, to fall down and worship before a certain image and that those who refused would be put to death in a fiery furnace. Three Hebrews who had convenanted to serve Jehovah God refused to obey that commandment and said to the king: AVe have no need to obey you in this matter; and if it be that you cast us into the fire, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace; and He will deliver us.’ The test was on. The three Hebrews were cast into the furnace; and because of their faithfulness God delivered them, and thus put His disapproval upon the emblem-saluting law of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The present-day attempt to compel school children and others who believe in and serve Jehovah God to salute any flag or sing any song is exactly in line with the Babylonish law just mentioned. To salute a flag means, in effect, that the person saluting ascribes salvation to what that flag represents, whereas salvation is of Jehovah God. The Hitler government, a stench in the nostrils of all honest people, requires all persons of Germany to give a certain salute and to cry out, “Heil Hitler!” and those who refuse to do so are severely punished. At the present time more than twelve hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison in Germany because of the commission of the ‘grave offense’ of declining to shout, “Heil Hitler!” They trust in Jehovah God and in Christ Jesus, and not in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses are men and women who have fully pledged themselves to obey the commandments of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. They fully comply with the commandment of Jesus, who said: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God’s.” (Luke 20:25) The meaning of that declaration of Jesus is this: Jehovah God is supreme, and His law is above all human laws. Caesar stands for the state or human law. All laws of the state or government that are not in conflict with God’s law should be gladly obeyed by all who are devoted to Jehovah God. When the law of man is in conflict with the law of Jehovah, then the Christian cannot obey that law of man. The apostles of Christ Jesus placed this exact construction upon the words of Jesus. In answer to charges of violating the law of the province or state they said to the high court: “Whether it be right in the sight of God [for us] to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. . . . We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 4:19; 5:29) Jehovah’s witnesses take that same stand. They gladly obey every law of the land that is not in conflict with God’s law. But when the law of man is in direct conflict with God’s law, they cannot and will not comply therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is written, at Romans 13:1: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers”; and many wrongfully hold that “the higher powers” are the visible rulers of the nations of earth. This scripture is addressed to the followers of Christ Jesus, and to no others, and “the higher powers” are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and every true follower of Christ Jesus must obey God in preference to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The flag of the United States is not the flag of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. It is the emblem of the power that rules the nation; and no one can truthfully say that God and Christ Jesus rule a government where crime is rampant. Men have organized governments, and Satan the Devil overreaches men and rules them because of their refusal to obey God, and hence the nations of the world are under the control of Satan the Devil, as stated at 1 John 5:19: “We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil one.” (</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font11"> In proof of this, mark the words of Jesus. That the Devil is the invisible ruler of the world, note this from the Bible: Satan took Jesus up on a high mountain, and, being the god of this world,- he showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and offered to give them to Jesus upon condition that Jesus would fall down and worship the Devil. Jesus refused and said (Matthew 4:10): “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In further proof, Jesus, at John 12: 31, stated that Satan is the prince or invisible ruler of this world. At John 18: 36, He said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” Jesus directed His followers to pray to God saying (Matthew 6:9-12): ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ At 2 Corinthians four it is written that Satan is the god of this world and deceives and blinds the people to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah's witnesses are true followers of Christ Jesus and must obey His commandments. To them the Lord says (John 15:19): “Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” At John 8:23: “I am not of this world.” At John 14:21: “He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.” Concerning His followers it is written in the Scriptures (Philippians 3:20): ‘For our citizenship is in heaven.’ </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham</span><span class="font11"> translation) At 1 John 5:21: “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” At 1 Corinthians 10:14: ‘Wherefore, my beloved brethren, flee from idolatry.’ This commandment is based upon the commandment at Exodus 20: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah's witnesses are in a solemn covenant or agreement to obey God and Christ Jesus, and for them to break that covenant means their destruction, as it is written, in Romans 1: 31, 32, that “covenant breakers . . . are worthy of death”. At Acts 3:23 they are told that every one who does not obey Christ shall be destroyed. When Jesus was about to be put to death the Roman governor pointed to Jesus and said to the Jews, “Behold your King”; and the Jews answered, “We have no king but Caesar.” (John 19:14,15) They were in a covenant to obey God. Their repudiation of their covenant resulted in their destruction. The question to each of Jehovah’s witnesses therefore is: “Shall I obey every command of man and die, or shall I obey Jehovah God and live?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect or cult. They are true followers of Christ Jesus. The Bible is their only creed. God has given them a banner or flag, and that is His message of truth, as stated in Psalm 20:5. Jehovah commands His witnesses to “lift up a standard for the people” (Isaiah 62:10), meaning that His witnesses must raise God's standard of truth and point to that as the only salvation of man. Every nation has a different standard; and therefore none of these are God’s standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Pilgrim fathers left the oppressive nations in Europe, and landed in New England, because of their sincere desire to be free to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. It now appears that in Massachusetts, the very cradle of American liberty, an oppressive rule is attempted to be enforced that takes away the liberty of the citizen to worship God as God has commanded that man shall worship. The government or state is wholly inconsistent and unfair in compelling citizens to salute the flag. No one is injured by a man conscientiously serving God as he is commanded by the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses are thoroughly devoted to God and Christ Jesus, and they will obey the laws of God always, and will obey the laws of the state or nation that are not contrary to God’s law. No government has a right to compel a man to violate God’s law in which he conscientiously and implicitly trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Supreme Court of the United States, in Church vs. United States, 143 U.S. 457, authoritatively ruled that the American government is a Christian nation. If the nation is standing by that ruling of the Supreme Court, then the nation must recognize the law of God as superior to the law of man, and where the two are in conflict the Christian must obey the law of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the ships that ply the sea the Roman Catholic service is held. At that service the flag of the pope is displayed above the flag of the United States. The United States Senate went on record, in February, 1929, as favoring the right of the flag of the pope to be thus displayed, and this appears in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record</span><span class="font11"> No. 47, page 2851. In that instance the senator from Massachusetts took the position that the flag of the pope is the flag of God. I wholly disagree with him in that regard; but giving him credit for believing that the flag of the Catholic church is the flag of God his words are appropriate. He said: “I for one refuse to depart from the time-honored American custom of placing the emblem of God above every other emblem of the world. I will not run down the pennant of God for any other emblem.” The Senate, by a vote of 68 to 10, sustained the senator in that position. The United States government is therefore estopped from saying that the flag of the United States should be honored above Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The most important question before the peoples of earth now is, Whom do you choose to serve, Jehovah or Satan the Devil? The crisis is here because the end of the Devil’s reign is at hand. Soon Christ Jesus will destroy all of the Devil’s organization visible and invisible, and that includes all who take their stand on the side of the Devil. Each person must choose for himself. There can be no compulsion on either side. As for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will serve and obey Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a great pity for the people who attend the churches that their clergymen fail to teach them the truth of God’s Word. For their neglect the clergymen are doubly responsible. Today the combined church organization celebrates “loyalty day”. Do they mean loyalty only to man ? If entirely loyal to God they do harm to no one. To compel the saluting of the flag, thereby saying in symbol, “We look to the flag for salvation,” is doing great harm to man and reproaching the name of Jehovah God.—Galatians 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Baltimore </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun</span><span class="font11"> editorially expresses the true American sentiment in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“For our part, we glory in Carleton’s spunk. Any statute requiring that the flag be saluted by school children is an insult to the Stars and Stripes, and ought to be resented by all patriots. Is our national ensign a swastika flag, to be respected only by forced salutes ? Since when has the Star-Spangled Banner so lost the respect of the people over whom it flies that laws are necessary to make them pretend to honor it? What a disgraceful thing it is to assume that the flag would not be saluted if people were not afraid to refuse the tribute of respect! ... It is supposed to float because its people have raised it of their own free will and uphold it out of preference—not because they fear it, but because they love it. If the time has come when they must be compelled to pay it a formal and forced tribute, then the time has come to haul it down and hoist in its place some red or black banner of dictatorship of force and fear.’’—Baltimore </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun</span><span class="font10"> of September 28, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Nichols lad has been taught by his parents to serve and obey Jehovah. He has made a wise choice, declaring himself for Jehovah God and His kingdom of righteousness. All who act wisely will do the same thing. The great multitude that serves God is revealed as saying: “Salvation [salutation] to our God, which sit-teth upon the throne, and unto the [Christ].”— Revelation 7: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Real American citizens who love the principles of the Bill of Rights and the fundamental law of the land, who believe in freedom of thought and freedom of speech, and, above all, in the right of man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, will commend the lad, Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., for the bold stand he has taken for Jehovah. It is foolish to attempt to make good citizens by compelling them to act as hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For more than 150 years honest Americans have obeyed the law without being compelled to salute the flag. Why the burning zeal to now compel flag-saluting? The reason is this, and once again I warn the American people, that the same power that caused Fascism and Hitlerism to seize governments in Europe is moving to seize control of the American institutions, and the policy of compulsory flag-saluting is but a part in that program to put fear into the minds of the people and compel submission to an arbitrary dictator. One mighty religio-polit-ical organization is back of the entire program. That organization is not the honest Catholic population, but it is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operating from Rome, in its determination to rule the whole earth. It has its political ambassadors in almost all countries. On March 8, 1934, a special cable dispatch from Rome to the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font11"> states that a definite agreement has been reached by President Roosevelt and the Vatican and that diplomatic relations shall be established between the United States and the “Holy See” as soon as public opinion in America can be brought around to the idea.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark61">2</a></sup> Compulsory saluting of the flag is in line with Hitlerism and a part of the studied, diabolical effort to bring the people around to the Roman idea. It is high time that the loyal and faithful American people realized this great peril. True and honest men of America, in which class Jehovah’s witnesses are included, do not need shotgun methods or prisons to compel them to do what is right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Boy Will Not Salute Flag</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[Reprint from Boston </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font9"> September 21, 1935]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eynn Child, 8, Refuses to Join in School Exercises—Is Backed by Father on Religious Grounds</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font11">HE refusal of an 8-year-old boy in the third grade of the Breed Elementary School at</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">West Lynn to join his classmates yesterday afternoon in saluting the American flag and singing “America” created a profound problem for the Lynn school authorities, which became further aggravated last night when the lad’s father, who called himself one of “Jehovah’s witnesses”, supported the boy’s alleged unpatriotic attitude and defied anyone to make him or his son change their convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The boy is Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., who readily admitted to newspaper reporters last night that he had told Principal William F. Pashby of the Breed School that the reason he didn't salute the flag was because it “was the devil’s emblem”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The boy’s father, Carleton B. Nichols, Sr., a machinist at the General Electric Company by day and a distributor of pamphlets and preacher of the doctrines of “Jehovah’s witnesses&quot;, formerly the International Bible Students Association, by night and Sundays, was emphatic in his declaration last night that neither his son nor himself, nor any members of his family, would violate the tenets of his faith by pledging any allegiance to the “Devil's kingdom”.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be beside the mark to say that this boy would be a credit to Patrick Henry or Thomas Jefferson, but it would be the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is beside the mark to say* that he is a credit to his parents, whose training is so manifest in hls conduct. That also Is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What must be said Is that he has given a splendid witness to Jehovah God and to Christ Jesus, the Father's choice as earth’s King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Boston Post Is on the editorial desk of every great newspaper in the world, and It Is respected, too, for its courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The report here presented is a credit to honest journalism, and a fair statement of the position of Jehovah's witnesses, whose devotion to Almighty God this child of tender years so well represents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus lost no time getting about His Father’s business; there were plenty of Roman youths to worship the Roman flag; He had other work to do. Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., has taken his stand as Jesus did, and has done it in a difficult place. “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What an example to some grown-ups! Later reports say Carleton was expelled by the school board October 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States Constitution estops these Nazi-minded “officials” from their persecution of this high-principled boy.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">SCHOOL AUTHORITIES AT SEA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Meanwhile Principal Pashby, following a conference with the father yesterday afternoon, at which the boy was present, took the matter under advisement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He forwarded a report of the incident to the school authorities, who frankly admitted it was the first case of its kind that had come to their attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just what move, if any, is to be made, will depend upon a ruling to be requested from the city solicitor relative to the application of the school and State laws to such incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The father is obviously sincere in his attitude,” Principal Pashby stated last night. “He has very pronounced convictions on the subject. Of course, the school and State laws are very specific in the matter of saluting the flag, and we have a positive duty to perform.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NICHOLS EXPLAINS ATTITUDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He was not prepared last night to state what action the school authorities will take after getting a legal ruling from the city solicitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nichols at his home last night, surrounded by his wife, who shares her husband's convictions on the subject, and their three children, of whom Carleton, Jr., is the eldest, explained just why he taught his son not to subscribe to ordinary patriotic standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“My children are Christian children,” he stated. “They are taught at home to be obedient, kind and meek. They are taught that the law of God is the highest authority governing man, and they are also taught to obey every law as long as it does not conflict with God's law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“the</span><span class="font8"> DEVIL'S KINGDOM”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He declared that the law compelling salute to the flag or the singing of “America” conflicted with God's law because they pledged an individual's allegiance to the Devil's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The Scriptures prove the truth of my assertion that this world, this country, the entire worldly kingdom, is not possessed by any government or any country, but by the Devil. Doesn't it say in the Scriptures that Satan took Christ up into a high mountain and showed Him the entire world and said that if Christ would kneel down and adore him, the Devil, he would give Him the entire kingdom known as the world ? Didn’t God then show that this world was the Devil’s kingdom? Why then should I, or my son, pledge allegiance to the Devil’s kingdom?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HAVE HAD HARD STRUGGLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nichols also pointed out that Christians pray in the Lord’s Prayer, “Thy kingdom come,” which he asserted proved that this kingdom on earth was not God’s kingdom, as His kingdom was to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nichols said he was born in Maine, as were his parents, grandparents and generations before him back to the Micmac Indians of the same State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I guess when it comes to nationality I'm as much an American as I possibly can be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He said he was working as a machinist at the General Electric Company but suffered with his family for 19 months in the depression. Uis wife, who said she was a native of New Hampshire, chimed in with the statement that when her youngest child, now about a year and one-half old, was about to be born, they were ejected from a tenement because they couldn't pay rent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The child has suffered from sugar diabetes ever since her birth,<sup>-</sup>’ the mother declared, and blamed it on the harsh treatment experienced by herself and family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HAVE BEEN ON WELFARE ROLLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Yes, and I worked at everything from peddling vegetables from house to house to cleaningout cesspools,” Nichols stated. “I didn’t make enough money to keep a bird alive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He then admitted that for a long while he was on the city of Lynn &quot;welfare rolls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mrs. Nichols recalled that all they obtained was $4 per week. “That didn’t keep us in food,” she averred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They are getting along better, as Nichols’ work as a machinist is now fairly steady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nichols declared that he was not an opponent of the government or of law. “True, they are imperfect, because man is imperfect,” he said. “I agree that they do the best they can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NOT FIRST CASE, NICHOLS CLAIMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He said he w<sup>T</sup>as opposed to war. “&quot;Why should I kill someone I never saw before ?&quot; he asked. He further averred that if a foreign nation invaded this country and the enemy came to his very door he would protect his family with all his strength, but if overcome, would leave the rest in “God’s hands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Of course I would lock my door, and I would stand there to use all the strength I was capable of to protect my wife and daughters, but if I were overcome and they got past me, the rest would be up to God. I would never kill a man to prevent him violating my house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although school officials contended the refusal of the Nichols boy to salute the flag was the first case on record, Nichols and his wife declared that a pupil of the Lynn Classical High School refused to lead the salute at last year’s graduation exercises and was not forced to do so. They also claim to know of other cases of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NO DOUBT OF THEIR SINCERITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Nichols boy, as far as teachers and principal knew, saluted the flag while in the first and second grades of school, and yesterday was the first time he refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Miss Yvonne Brooks, the child’s teacher, after trying to prevail on the child, took him to Principal Pashby, who requested the father's presence at the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The principal said that the father condoned his boy's attitude and quoted the Scriptures at length to prove the validity of his stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Principal Pashby also quoted the Scriptures and referred to the passage, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God’s,” without any impression on the representative of “Jehovah’s witness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Miss Brooks, daughter of a former Lynn minister, said last night that young Nichols is one of her best pupils. She said that she did not doubt the sincerity of the pupil or his family in their scruples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Can America Be Saved?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(From </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">L</span><span class="font11">ITTLE does the public seem to realize the gravity of our national peril. Whether the Republic shall survive or perish turns on the ability of Franklin D. Roosevelt to inflict himself on us another four years. With ten billion dollars in his hands for that purpose and with the opposition bewildered and disorganized, he may re-elect himself. If he does, the nation is doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It were suicidal to deceive ourselves. He is clearly determined to wreck the United States. He intends to blot out the States and saddle on us a Fascist dictatorship at Washington. He has demonstrated his contempt for the Constitution. He is daily piling up new proofs. He will openly denounce and reject it as soon as he feels that he dares. Re-election would bring the opportunity that he awaits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Only outwardly did he accept the recent Supreme Court decisions. Any other course now would foreclose the possibility of his re-election. It was to test the mind of the nation that he railed against the court when its opinions were rendered. Had the reaction been in his favor, he would have settled the question then and there. But he found the people loyal to the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In spite of his ostensible submission, he now treats the Constitution with increased disdain. He is whipping through Congress revolutionary statutes which he must know are unconstitutional. His whole batch of “must” bills are of that type. They are rushed through without debate and without a roll-call vote to place members on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He has pursued no policy clearly in accord with the Constitution. He proceeds on the theory that America is a gigantic failure and the Constitution a fatal handicap. With Hitler and Mussolini he assumes that government by the people has definitely failed. Its theory is that we have groped in the dark till Roosevelt and Farley and Johnson and Wallace and Tugwell now come with divine mandate to rescue us and take away the liberties that beguiled us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every major act whipped through Congress bristles with that theory. It underlies the terrorism of Johnson and Wallace and other tyrants. It is back of the frightful squandering. It is voiced at least by innuendo in all the official propaganda. It laughs at the ideals of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall and Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln and the other beacon lights of the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We face the question whether that theory shall triumph. The question will be definitely settled in the next general election. In the last 100 years only three presidents have served two full terms. All forfeited in the second term the popularity which characterized them in the first. If re-elected next year, Franklin D. Roosevelt would repeat that record with emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Expediency required by his candidacy now imposes restraints from which he would then Jje free. Contempt of the Constitution must be now veiled. But it would boldly assert itself then. Open violation of the law defined by the Supreme Court now would be fatal at the ballot box. But he would then be beyond the reach of the voters. What he dare not do now, he could do with impunity then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The lust for irresponsible power is even now persistent and startling. Never before did executive usurpation require judicial restraint so constant and vigorous. Under protest does the president outwardly yield to that restraint while pushing new usurpations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What he so obviously seeks to do now, he would do with audacity after his re-election. His wish to reign as a dictator would then be gratified. He could defy both ballots and courts. Both would cease to function or be subordinated to the will of the dictator. The pending election will decide whether the Republic shall survive or perish. Let all good citizens gird for the momentous decision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The fate Of this first trial balloon was carefu'.’y watched by the Administration and seems to have convinced President Roosevelt that further steps may be safely taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In this connection the Vatican's tolerance of the Rev. Charles E. Coughlin of Royal Oak, Mich., “radio priest” and defender of the New Deal, may be significant. It is true that technically the Rev. Mr. Coughlin’s participation in politics may be described as a local affair within the competence of the bishop of Detroit. Nevertheless, if the Vatican found Father Coughlin's viewpoint repugnant there is no doubt that he would be silenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">President Roosevelt’s plan is being developed with all the more caution because of the passions aroused during the campaign of Alfred E. Smith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">dictate caution In dealing with the third element of a triad which once caused one of the greatest upheavals in American party politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For all of these and other seasons the new plan for exchanging diplomatic representatives has been and will be pursued with the greatest possible caution. The Vatican never makes haste and may welt decide that it is better to wait indefinitely than to risk failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pope himself feels so strongly about premature publication of Vatican news that he has been known to change and even abandon plans solely because they were discovered and printed by newspapers before he considered the occasion appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the considerations pertinent to the question of establishing relations with the Vatican is the theory held in some quarters of the Vatican that such relations legally exist, because they have never been formally terminated since -the last American minister, Rufux King, left Rome. Certain church lawyers assert that, while the post of minister has not been filled for sixty-four years, the post as such exists, just as often occurs for shorter times in other diplomatic posts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Attention: The Editor</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Gentlemen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I understand that from 10: 00 o’clock to 10: 15 a.m. yesterday, over a chain of the big Radio Stations, a speech was made by John F. Rutherford, President of the Watch Tower Bible Society. I did not hear of the matter until late yesterday afternoon, therefore I missed the broadcast. However, since the speech was made at the request of the Associated Press and several prominent programs gave their time to make way for the special item referred to, I naturally expected to find the text of the speech in this morning’s ‘ ‘ Times ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have searched this morning’s edition and failed to find any mention whatsoever, which very much surprises me as I have always felt the New York Times, an outstanding paper is giving all the important news, and giving it in true detail. Considering the nature of the Broadcast, its Biblical references, its sponsors, and the special arrangements necessary for putting it on the air, I cannot understand why you have not printed the speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With reluctance I want to believe that The New York Times has any biased views; but rather leads American Journalism in the matter of serving the people as a newspaper exercising its constitutional rights, printing all sides of any question, so that people may be able to form their own opinions in a fair way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Therefore, since you apparently have omitted the item in question, may I ask you your reason in doing so? Your answer either through the columns of your paper or by mail (stamped envelope enclosed) will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Walter H. Gates</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font11">HE Lynn flag-saluting case continues to attract attention. For refusing to salute the flag eight-year-old Carleton Nichols was expelled from school despite various Massachusetts laws which stipulate, among other things, ‘‘Every child between 7 and 14 shall attend a public school. The School Committee shall enforce attendance. No child shall be excluded on account of race, color or religion.” Other Massachusetts children have taken a stand similar to that by Carleton. They will not be coerced. Here and there is an American editor who sees the issue plainly. Such a one is the editor of the Buffalo </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Express,</span><span class="font11"> which, under the caption &quot;Pashbyism at Lynn”, had the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘‘In his own little sphere as a public school principal in Lynn, Mass., William A. Pashby* seems determined that Pashbyism shall be over all just as Hitlerism is over all in Germany, religion included. It is a pity that the American flag has been subjected to such abuses as Pashby, a World War veteran, has put it. Instead of serving as an instrument whereby to defend religion, the American flag should continue to be known as the standard whereunder religion can </span><span class="font9">* Pashby is a Roman Catholic “educated” in a Catholic school. </span><span class="font10">be pursued as one’s conscience dictates. ... No robot has yet been invented to determine when we poor weak mortals are moved by high principles or merely by stubborn desire to have our own way. Perhaps none can be. So one will have to do his own guessing as to what underlies Pashbyism. If we must make fools of ourselves every now and then by trying to sustain a position which we ought never to have created, at least we ought not to try to cover up under the flag.”</span></p>

Hitler has the same idea; so has Mussolini; so has Stalin; so has the pope. If there is ever held a parade of all the forces that are opposed to that for which the United States government was founded, they should put Ambrose, Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin in the front automobile and a good wagonload of the Daughters of the American Revolution in the second one. Force in education, force in everything, seems to be about the only idea they have. The D.A.R., with infinite stupidity, is now urging a Teachers’ Oath Bill in every state, and this from teachers that are as old as most of the D.A.R. ladies themselves, and that is saying a great deal.</span></p>

The courageous senator from Michigan (Mr. Couzens) has already called the turn in his declaration that whoever wrote this resolution should be hanged. But whoever inspired it, whoever wrote it or whoever condones it, it is a stealthy cunning circumvention of the Constitution. It is the culmination of a treasonous plot. It explains the planned emergencies and forced chads that has tied hand and foot and gagged a docile, trusting, obedient, law-abiding, bewildered people. If this relief measure passes the Senate, as requested by the president, it would be the final step in delivering us into a worse condition of servitude than our forefathers crossed the ocean and built this nation to escape.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">States Senate something of the achievements of the 37,000 foreign agents that are in America trying to run the country. He gave them large credit for bringing about shipments of coal from England, potatoes from Ireland, iron ingots from India, and glass and lace from Belgium. He thought it quite remarkable that the meat for the CCC camps was purchased from Argentina, which camps are now costing more than the standing army. He was amazed at the success of these agents in bringing in cotton from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, gunny cloth from India, copper from Canada and Africa, milk and cream from Canada, canned tomatoes from Italy, green peas from Mexico, and hides and cheese from Australia. He marveled that the United States cannot pay $400,000,000 bonus due the soldiers, but can cheerfully pay out of the treasury the annual interest, $750,000,000, which the allies agreed to pay on their debts, but which with the exception of Finland they have agreed not to pay. Concerning France Mr. Schall said: ‘'One billion three hundred million dollars was loaned to France after the armistice. Yet they tell us, YVe cannot pay you a cent.’ Although France has loaned something like $17,000,000,000 since the war to other nations, yet she cannot pay the United States one penny.” Mr. Schall paid his respects to the financial acumen of the foreign legion in the following interesting passage:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Any political convention that has a chance to elect a president attracts the foreign eye. I was told that at the 1920 convention there was enough foreign money present to pay off the German indemnity. Since the war foreign countries have taken an extraordinary interest in the nominations of our presidents in both Democratic and Republican parties. Our present president up to the time that he took the governor’s chair in New York was a member of the board of directors of the International Bankers Association; and speaking of the governorship of New York, there was $80,000,000 in the state treasury when he came in, and when he left there was a deficit of $90,000,000. He is some spender. I heard two Negroes quarreling in that convention of 1920. One of them had received $3,000 and the other one only $2,500, and the fellow who got $2,500 was sore.” (Laughter.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enator Schall, of Minnesota, must have been on his ear or on his dignity or on something when he said in the United States Senate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Never before in the history of this nation has our government stooped to such lying and deceit as we have witnessed in Washington during the past two years. Fully 99 percent of all the statements issued by these Government press agencies are falsehoods. They are designed to deceive the people and make them believe their government is trying to help them, when just the opposite is the purpose of this maladministration of our affairs. Every day a dozen or more of these untrue statements are handed to the press and radio, printed, and broadcast as truth. Not even under the Soviet rule in Russia are so many barefaced untruths given out as Government facts. Our government has resolved itself into a propaganda bureau for disseminating falsehoods to its citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mr. Schall gave numerous examples to prove the truth of these remarkable statements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Seth C. Maker, of California, sometimes known as “The Philistine”, was asked the question: “When the machine age is more fully developed, and science has contributed a fuller share to make a finished world, what will society do to take care of the myriads no longer needed in the field of production?” To this Dr. Maker replied, and his answer will be of interest even to those who know that the only possible remedy is in Jehovah’s kingdom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The condition described in this question is not a contingency of the future, but is already here, and the problem awaits solution. The myriads no longer needed in the field of production are with us on every hand, and as time passes the increased efficiency of the machine will add to this vast army of the unemployed. Until new occupations are devised, or until human genius finds a method of expression for idle but willing hands, the maintenance of those now out of work will become the responsibility of government. The transitional period through which we are now passing is not highly encouraging, and what the future holds is anything but certain. A hundred plans have been formulated to meet present demands and save the capitalist system, but organization and unity of purpose are both lacking. Some of these plans are of sufficient merit to temporarily cure our economic ills, but each, without exception, necessarily embodies the socialization of one or more established institutions. Therefore they are being strenuously opposed, not only by those who believe their private interests would be in jeopardy, but by the so-called representatives of the people who find inspiration only in the almighty dollar. It is contended, for instance, that the socializing of the money system for the public good will lead to the socializing of industry; which is not necessarily true. While the people are jostling and milling, highly paid social philosophers would have them believe that the hit-or-miss plan of rugged individualism is preferable to any that would guarantee the social security of the mass. These philosophers refer to Douglas, Townsend, Long, Coughlin and Sinclair as demagogues and dreamers, and any man who dares to speak for the common cause is reviled and ridiculed for asserting that the masses have any rights that individualists are bound to respect. ... In all of this medley of sound, however, it is impossible to hide the obvious faults of the present system. We know that the people are confronted by many evils that have grown out of unrestrained individualism. Special privilege is in evidence everywhere. Democracy is slowly but surely disappearing, and social progress is blocked at every turn by an organized and all-powerful minority. Majority rule exists in name only. Already an amendment to the Constitution has been proposed, which, if passed, will put the people of the United States under an absolute dictator. All of this may be regarded as a penalty for widespread inertia and lack of vigilance. Liberty is diminishing as the years go by, because </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font10">people are not zealous of their political rights, and </span><span class="font11">are </span><span class="font10">indolently neglectful of the responsibility which every citizen must assume if this nation is not to be dominated by Communism or Fascism. . . . Therefore what happens in the future will depend on the alertness, the judgment, and the determination of the people. What they want they can have if they will only </span><span class="font11">or</span><span class="font10">ganize and demand it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font11">SUBSCRIBER sends five clippings from Spokane papers showing how unwelcome surplus labor is in that city at this time and says: “Spokane, Wash., draws from the largest mining and lumbering industry in the Northwest. When times were good and pay checks large, the lumberjacks and miners were greeted in Spokane with open arms, and catered to till their money was gone, but, of course, they could always go back to the job and earn plenty more to spend. Now these same men, with no money, no home, and a job a thing of the past, are not wanted, as the clippings show. But when a Big Business man goes under, one would be led to believe from the holler that he was the only one who had lost anything.” Up until recently the only prescription Big Business had for a surplus of labor was to have a war and kill them off, but labor is not taking so kindly now as it did at one time to the idea of being killed, and some are even mean enough to hint that in the next war the workers should stay at home and let the Big Bankers and Big Politicians and Big Preachers go to the front. It upsets everything to have workers talking and thinking like that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s Organisation</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">S</span><span class="font11">ATAN, the Devil, has an organization of which he is the prince or chief. It is made up of a host of wicked angels which control the nations of the earth and draw into it all wicked men. The commercial, political and religious organizations on earth form a part of Satan’s organization because they are dominated by that wicked one.—1 John 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How did Satan get an organization? Originally his name was Lucifer. He was then in harmony with God and God made him overlord of mankind. Lucifer rebelled against God and formed an organization of his own into which he drew many angels and almost all of the human race. From then till now he is designated in the Scriptures as Satan, Serpent, Dragon, and Devil. He challenged God to put men on earth who would remain true and faithful to God and righteousness. God has given Satan full opportunity to prove his wicked challenge, and for that reason God has not interfered with his wicked rule of the world until the time comes for the destruction of the same. That time is now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The organization of Satan is symbolized by a wicked woman, and “the seed of Satan” means those that become a part of his organization after it was first formed. At the time God sentenced man to death at Eden He said that He would put enmity between the Devil (pictured by the Serpent) and God’s woman or organization, and that the seed of God’s woman or organization would bruise the head of Satan’s seed. (Genesis 3:15) This symbolic language is a prophecy foretelling God’s purpose to destroy all those who follow in the lead of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">True to the prophecy of Jehovah there has always been enmity between God’s organization and Satan’s organization. Every man who has taken his stand on the side of God and tried to do right has been persecuted by Satan and his agents. At Babylon Satan set up a religious system as a part of his organization. From then till now the earthly part of Satan’s organization has been made up of religion, politics and commerce. Men have formed these visible organizations, and the wily foe Satan has overreached them, blinded men to the truth, and turned them away from God. Satan has used the religious organizations as his chief instrument for the persecution of those who do right. Religion is his best means by which to deceive and entrap the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan and his seed persecuted Jesus when He was on earth, and in doing so Satan used the religionists to harass Jesus and to bring about His crucifixion. Likewise Satan uses men of his organization to persecute today those who are witnesses for Jehovah. The Bible contains an abundance of proof as to the manner of developing the seed of Satan and how it is used to bring sorrow upon mankind. The three books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font11"> show you where to find the truth in the Bible and how all these texts harmonize and explain the present conditions in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A host of wicked angels that form a part of Satan’s organization is employed to deceive men and cause them to commit crimes of the most atrocious kind. Those wicked angels impersonate men who have died, and by this means millions are deceived into believing that their beloved dead are still alive. Now the time has come when God by His Chief Executive Officer, His ‘seed of promise’, will bring about the complete destruction of Satan and his seed. That is absolutely necessary in order for peace and happiness to come to the children of men. Satan and his agents now are putting forth every possible effort to prevent the people from learning the truth, which truth is so essential for the welfare of men. By all means, and regardless of all opposition, you should now learn the truth of God’s Word concerning these mighty organizations, because it is only the truth that shall open to you the way of freedom and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are millions of persons now on the earth who are under the domination of Satan’s oppressive organization and who would like to get out from under it. They have been kept there by reason of an ignorance of the truth. Jehovah God has provided a way of escape for such, if they will learn and obey His will. All men of good will who desire now to get out from under the wicked organization of Satan are commanded to flee to the kingdom of God under Christ and thereby find a place of refuge from the great tribulation that shall shortly come upon the world. The way of escape is to believe on Christ as the Savior of man and then prove your belief by taking your stand on the side of God and His kingdom. Thus a man identifies himself with God’s organization and places himself under it; and to such alone does Jehovah furnish protection and blessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font11">NE of the sound cars operating out of Washington (D.C.) headquarters reports: “At Marshall, Va., permission was asked of the chief of guards if we could witness to the prisoners. After explaining the work the chief released fifty prisoners from ball and chain, formed them in a square, and covered them with high-powered rifles, and a program suitable for the occasion was put on. The prisoners seemed happy and the guard enjoyed it enthusiastically. It was a touching scene when the record was played which explained how Jehovah will break the bands off all prisoners. In a suburb of Baltimore, Md., a record was put on, when a woman,a preacher’s wife, came out screaming, threw a fit, wanted the lecture stopped, went back into the house and phoned for the police. When the officer arrive d there were fourteen white and colored standing around the car, with some sitting on the curb, listening to the lecture. The officer said he was sent from the station on a complaint from a woman who said there were enough ministers in the neighborhood to take care of the people's salvation. He was asked if it would be right to deny the fourteen the privilege of listening (some of whom had already made contributions to the cause) because one person objected, and that, not because the noise distressed her, but because the message of the Kingdom was being preached. The officer said, 'It sounds good to me,’ but on his suggestion the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">car was moved a little</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">way farther down the road. At one point an excursion train with 300 persons on board was waiting at a siding. The horns were turned toward the train and 'America’s End’ was run. During the lecture many put their heads out of the windows to listen. At York, Pa., a lad came running up, wondering that the note he had sent to Brooklyn the day previous had such an immediate answer: it seems he had sent in asking that the car come to York. He was reminded of the promise, ‘Before they call I will answer.’ At Frederick, Md., the Watch Tower quartette was put on, suitable announcement was made, and within twenty minutes a carload of Jona-dabs came driving up, accompanied by friends. At Hagerstown, Md., a very enterprising dominie had been busy broadcasting, advising the people to buy the books being distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses, and then burn them. The car was parked across the street from this man’s house, a quartette record was put on, and he came out on the front porch with his family to enjoy the serenade. Then some stirring records were pilt on, and at the conclusion the announcement was made that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town calling on all the people with the books and booklets which had been so widely advertised over the radio by the dominie. As a result, 6 books and 305 booklets were placed in the neighborhood.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Prize Liar Located</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font11">HE prize liar has been located; he is a preacher or priest at Iowa Falls, Iowa. On August 16,1935, the Mason City (Iowa) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">GlobeGazette</span><span class="font11"> carried the following infamous falsehood. Ostensibly dated August 24, it was no doubt written on August 14. Like the date, everything in the story is a lie, which, of course, is vdiat one normally expects from a preacher or priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Investigation discloses the fact that Judge Rutherford never spoke at Iowa Falls in his life, and never tried to do so, though he did speak at some of the larger Iowa cities some thirty years ago. Since then he has become the greatest Bible expositor since the apostles of Jesus Christ. His works have been placed in the hands of the people to the extent of over two hundred million copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in Washington, D.C., May 30 to June 3, 1935, of which convention Judge Rutherford was the director and the principal speaker, the Washington press unanimously admitted what could not be concealed, that it was much the greatest religious convention ever held in that convention city. That speaks for itself. See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> No. 413, containing cablegrams from 38 foreign countries, showing the world-wide interest in his public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If Judge Rutherford were to speak now or try to speak in Iowa Falls the nice little city of 4,112 population could not possibly receive the crowd that would come. In a town of that size there are certainly not more than 1,000 homes; what would the town do with 20,000 strangers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is hard for an honest man to give advice to a liar, but the best way for a liar to get himself believed is to tell something that sounds reasonable and might possibly be believed. The Iowa Falls liar has outdone the Ananias fraternity; he is entitled to the first prize for stupidity, in the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Used Phonograph to Broadcast Ideas; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Put Under Arrest</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Iowa Falls, Aug. 24 [14],—Judge Rutherford, well known in town as a “doomsday” preacher, has made several attempts to speak in Iowa Falls but was never able to draw a crowd into a hall. Recently he was allowed to speak in one of the city parks, but his speech was stopped by authorities when he began to be abusive to members of other beliefs. Sunday night Rutherford disciples with three phonographs and a supply of records set up in different places about town and broadcasted Judge Rutherford’s speeches. One phonograph downtown had its loud-speaker projected into the street from an upstairs window and its operator was arrested, charged with disturbing the peace. In court Monday a small fine was remitted on promise of good behavior in the future.</span></p>

C.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and Sentinel, </span><span class="font11">under the title “Misusing Religion”, the following, which is quoted but in part: “The most dangerous of false prophets are those who mix and mingle religion with seditious doctrine. In this country are propagandists preaching Communism pure and simple, which they have sugar-coated with a thin veneer of religion. One of the favorite devices of these radical propagandists is to quote Scripture by the chapter, yard or ream. In America a new deal is in the making for the people, provided they are patient and keep faith with the great president who has already done so much for them. They must not in this hour of grave decision turn to the walking after strange gods. Their reasonable hope is in Franklin D. Roosevelt, and if they keep faith with him, he shall justify their confidence in due season and prove the absurdities of the doctrines of the false prophets who would lead a nation into chaos while crying loudly upon the name of the deity.”</span></p>

We must either serve God or a worldly master. Our citizenship should be registered in heaven. It is sad to observe how political interests extinguish the holy fire in a clergyman’s heart. The clergyman’s position is exceedingly dangerous in Parliament, where he easily becomes entangled in party aspirations. I must warn clergymen against the politician’s slippery and dangerous path.” The archbishop’s appeal to the clergy to avoid politics and help the children, the sick and the aged was well received by the people.</span></p>

A Baptist preacher heard it all. When the lecture was over he was mad and said, ‘If you people will make me up $10 I will answer that question, “Where are the dead ?” ’ So you see how anxious the preacher was for the welfare of the people and the good name of Jehovah God.

The tree upon which Jesus was impaled by the Romans is still (so it is claimed) in the possession of the Roman “church”. The seamless robe which the soldiers took away from the Savior is found in the possession of the “church” which persecutes His followers. The thorns of the crown He wore, the spear, the nails, the binding cord, the burial shroud, are claimed by the same plunderbund. And (they say) now is produced the sponge that was held to Christ’s lips; and soon we shall discover that these mercenaries have all the gall in which that sponge was dipped. The way the exhibitions of these impostures are reported in twentieth century “news” dispatches is painful, but revealing, as will be noted from the following:</span></p>

Describing his adoption of heathen customs, with a pretense of Christianity associated with them, the account says: “Now every summer, forty or so youths are initiated into full adult membership of tribe according to revised rite. All night they dance the ancient dance at the doors of the cathedral. For invocation of tribe’s departed spirits is substituted Litany used to offer flour ceremonially. Bishop offers bread—in the sacrifice of the Mass. Chief and Christian priest side by side lead procession of tribesmen, grass-hatted, leaping, yelling, banging drums, to camp where candidates are to be isolated for a month or six weeks. First they submit, in accordance with ancient use, to circumcision.” By methods similar to these great numbers are being taken into the Catholic “church” in central Africa.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">rpHE Roman Hierarchy can be confidently expected to take its stand on the Devil’s side of every question. When Congress was trying to get rid of the public utility holding corporations, so that the American people would not have to pay three prices for their electric current, Bishop William D. O’Brien, of Chicago, injected himself into the situation by a letter to Congress in which he said, “The annuity and endowment funds of the Catholic Church Extension Society have been invested during the past fifteen or twenty years largely in public utility securities.” Of course! Why not? In other words, when the readers of this journal pay their electric light bills they have the satisfaction of knowing that a good hunk of the money goes to help put the Roman Hierarchy in full charge of the country.</span></p>

The reason why the American people have no confidence in the Roman Hierarchy, not a particle, is that they are kept informed, by Jehovah's witnesses, of just what the Hierarchy is doing to American rights and liberties from day to day. The powers of oppression and suppression used to work well, and there is still a desperate effort to make them work now, but they just don’t work. The cat is out of the bag and will stay out.</span></p>

Lest any wonder why it is that with everything else that Christ ever touched or wore or used that is being exhibited for hire there is not also shown the ass upon which He rode into Jerusalem, it is explained that the art of taxidermy was not ‘invented’ until 1880. As soon as enough time has elapsed that the works revealing this fact can be destroyed or put where they cannot be found there will be put on exhibition one ass, and then another, and another, until finally there will be as many as are mentioned in Numbers 31:45, which is 30,500.

The British parliament recently passed a so-called “Disaffection Bill”; did not know why they did it; nor did anybody else. Everybody that had any sense could see it was aimed against freedom of speech and of the press, but some sinister power forced it through. Now America is undergoing a similar experience. At this writing a bill has passed the Senate, and has been reported favorably for passage in the House, which would make it a two-year prison offense for a person to write to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font11"> or any other publication, opposing war, deploring the amount of appropriations for the army or navy, or criticizing any phase of the military or naval organizations of the United States, and if published, the editor and publisher also could be jailed, and fined $1,000 in the bargain. Congressmen Maury Maverick, of Texas, and Paul J. Kvale, of Minnesota, say of this proposed bill: “The truth is that the bill is not really aimed at Communists (that is a subterfuge), but at the honest peacetime expression of opinions on anything remotely concerning the army or navy by decent American citizens of any projects favored by profiteering munition makers and other similar interests. It is a brash piece of Hitler-istic fascism.” The bill will probably pass, because Gog and the Devil are back of it.

<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>The Art of Reading</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font11">HERE is an art in reading a newspaper which is somewhat difficult to cultivate but which yields entertaining and more or less instructive results. For instance, the case of Joseph L. Steinmetz, who in a moment of anger killed his wife and the priest in whose bedroom he found her. The newspaper reports of the trials are illuminating. The Catholic censor or annotator is usually on hand to see that a matter of this kind is properly presented to the public, that is, when it cannot be kept out of the paper altogether. Thus the item after being properly checked appears, in part, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Steinmetz was indicted for murder in the fatal shooting of his bride of two weeks and the Rev. Joseph L. Leonard, Catholic priest, when he </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">allegedly</span><span class="font11"> found them together in the priest’s room at a midtown hotel. When he saw this scene, his wife practically naked,’ stated Samuel S. Liebowitz, his counsel, ... 'a monkey wrench was thrown into his mental machinery . . . ’ In his opening statement to the jury, Liebowitz portrayed Father Leonard—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">previously released from his church duties because of mental illness—</span><span class="font11">as ‘not even worthy to be called a man.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The italics are apparently additions made by the censor to somewhat tone down the force of the situation. Maidens and brides, however, may learn from this that when a priest invites them to his private quarters to “confess” it is a good indication of “mental illness” and that something should be done to “release him from his church duties”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">His man, “Father” Harney, has admitted that it is the teaching of the pope’s “church”, and the plain intent of the Roman Hierarchy, to destroy all Protestants as soon as they feel strong enough. Meantime, some who have been instructed by the Hierarchy are willing to go as far as they dare. Thus a correspondent writing from Jackson, Mich., says: “We had a taste of Roman ‘tolerance’ here last summer. There was a Protestant convention here and the Catholics came to the tent and threw sticks and stones. A stone hit a lady in the eye and sent her to the hospital; very nearly put her eye out. They put oil on the tent and tried to set it on fire. They threw rotten eggs also.” These arguments for re-entering the fold appeal to some, but will hardly be convincing to the British.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“But they say that the TVA does not take into account all the items of expense which the power interests have to meet. That is true: they don’t have to take them all into consideration, for they don’t have to pay them all. For instance, here are a few of the items of expense the power interests have to meet that the TVA does not incur: (1) Dividends on watered stocks. (2) Exorbitant tributes to holding companies. (3) Money to buy up newspapers and magazines for propaganda purposes. (4) High-priced lawyers, employed for their political influences—usually relatives or law partners of high public officials, and sometimes the officials themselves. (5) Money spent to influence elections, contributions to campaign funds of their ‘favorite’ candidates for public office. (6) Unreasonably high salaries and bonuses paid to power company or holding company officials. (7) Money uselessly spent by the power trust in trying to defeat President Roosevelt, both in 1932 and in 1936, to say nothing of the expense of their campaign of propaganda against Secretary Ickes of the Interior, who is in charge of the construction of Boulder Dam, which is to be the greatest public power project on earth. The TVA does not have to meet these expenses. Therefore it can supply power at something like what it costs to produce and transmit it. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“It means no more nor less than that every year 5 percent of the whole national wealth (thus, within twenty years, the whole national wealth.) has to be newly produced by the workers of all shades, besides the amounts necessary for the maintenance and amortization of all properties. This 5 percent flows into the pockets of the capital owners in form of unearned income. If there were no necessity to pay interest the workers would receive besides their present income, every 20 years, the whole national wealth; i.e., the workers would receive an increase of working income equalling in 20 years the whole national wealth. In view of compound interest, only 16 years arc required to accomplish this fact. Higher interest will do it in correspondingly shorter periods. Unearned incomes in all civilized countries are of about the same volume as working incomes. The workers are despoiled by capitalism for about half of their rightful income.”</span></p>

Here are people of good stock, potential members of a great community, and they are being treated worse than animals, worse than farming implements and stock. They are dressed in rags; they have barely enough food to keep them alive; their children get no education; they are a prey to diseases which the scientific resources of civilization could easily eliminate.” The details of what she saw in some of the homes are enough to make the stoutest heart sicken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Every Man by His Own Standard”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.”-—Numbers 1: 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font11">HEN the children of Israel came out of Egypt it suited the purposes of Jehovah God to let each tribe camp by itself, about its own particular banner. The banners of Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan are mentioned by name. One can see the reason why this was done. Here were 2,000,000 people, suddenly released from slavery. The children of the various tribes would soon get to know the banner of their tribe and thus could readily find their parents when accidentally separated from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s people are not without their banner. The psalmist speaks of this banner when he says, “We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners.” (Psalm 20:5) The same writer continues, “Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.” (Ps. 60:4) ‘The banner of Jehovah God’ is thus seen to be a poetic reference to the publishing of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The wise man in the Song of Solomon has something further to say of the banner of Jehovah God: “He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.” In this same poem Jehovah’s witnesses are described as, “terrible as an army with banners.” (Song of Solomon 6:4,10) This is but a poetic way of stating that the banner of truth, the banner of love for God, has in it that which strikes terror to those who do not love truth and therefore do not love God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Concerning this banner of truth and love, the prophet Isaiah says, “Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.” (Isaiah 13:2) There is here a command resting upon Jehovah’s witnesses to widely publish the truth so that others may enter into the Kingdom. Jehovah God has given His assurance that this work of publishing the truth shall be done: “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the [nations], and set up my standard to the people.” (Isaiah 49:22) The instrument which Jehovah God is using to set up this standard is the servant whom He has chosen, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Again, through the mouth of this same prophet, comes the command from Jehovah God to His witnesses in the earth: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isaiah 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The prophet Jeremiah mentions this same banner, or standard of truth, and shows that it not only is a standard of truths pleasing to the ear, such as the general truths of salvation for man, but contains a message of direst import to all the nations involved in the World War and in all the other wars that have broken the everlasting covenant. Thus the word of the Lord, speaking by Jeremiah the prophet, says, “Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.”—Jeremiah 50:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Devil Has His Banners, Too</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not only does Jehovah God have His banner or standard of truth and love, but the Devil has his banners or standards in opposition thereto and invites all nations to come to his support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One can see how this worked out in the case of Daniel, and also in the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. Although these men had done nothing wrong to anybody, they were repeatedly placed in jeopardy because Satan’s banners or standard were used against them in an improper manner.—Daniel 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many hundreds of different flags in the world, and there have been many thousands, no doubt; for in the last twelve years fifteen of the seventy-odd nations in the earth have made new flags for themselves. In the United States, in 1747, there were twenty colonial flags in use; and since the Declaration of Independence the national flag has existed in thirty forms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">What nation today can claim to be the nation of Jehovah God? When the Devil took Jesus up into a high mountain and showed Him all the governments of the world in a moment of time, what nation did He exempt? What flag, of all the nations of the earth, can properly be said to be Jehovah's banner of truth and love? Certainly none.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Because the swastika originally represented a hurricane, and because many Japanese were killed by a hurricane, the Japanese used it for an emblem on caskets. Adolph Hitler adopted this emblem because when he was a child he lived opposite a convent in the courtyard of which was an archway over which was an engraved shield bearing a swastika. Merely because Adolph Hitler saw this emblem when he was a child, millions of Germans are supposed to grovel in the dust, before the swastika.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Magistrate Brodsky of New York was absolutely right when he described the swastika as “rightly or wrongly regarded by these defendants and others of our citizenry as a gratuitously brazen flaunting of an emblem which symbolizes all that is antithetical to American ideals of the God-given and inalienable rights of all peoples to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness ; that in their minds this emblem of the Nazi reign stands for and represents war on religious freedom, the disfranchisement of nationals solely on religious and ethnological grounds, the debasement of the learned professions, the deprivation of the right to education and the earning of a livelihood”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Is the War Department loyal to the flag? Why certainly; why not? The War Department buys hats from the Michael A. Zelinski Hat Company. On a certain date it awarded a contract to make 140,625 hats for the CCC. Twenty days later the firm was found guilty of making the employees “kick back” $7 a week out of the $22 they received. Under orders the contract was canceled, but as soon as the Supreme Court declared the NBA unconstitutional the War Department reawarded the contract to the same firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Newark, N. J., Uncle Sam built a war base that cost $11,000,000. Then brilliant army officers entered into a contract with the Mercur Corporation to operate the base, paying the government 90 percent of the profits after deducting maintenance and operating costs. The Mercur Corporation had such a wonderful bookkeeping system that on an expenditure of $4,692,546.76 they painfully handed over to Uncle Sam as his share of the profits a grand total of 59c. All will notice that this is 29c more than usual, and will wonder at the Mercur Corporation’s generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) is loyal to the flag, too. Why not? When the TVA had to buy a cow it paid $900 for one, and also in nine months spent $90,000 for rental of automobiles. Surely there are many reasons here for a politician to be patriotic.</span></p>

They also sold Germany, for industrial purposes, powder, bullets and machine guns. And the joke of it is that these self-confessed patriots that paid munitions dividends of 39,000 percent and 1,143,275 percent let the foreigners have lower prices than they charged to Uncle Sam. These are the men that bust up peace conferences, by men used to such work, who are- hired for the purpose, like William B. Shearer. In case of war these are the men that supply the United States with advice and really run the country.

<p><span class="font11">The flag oath was invented by a busybody old maid in Kansas. Heywood Broun, the famous columnist, quoted with approval the statement, “The D. A. R. and other fervent self-appointed guardians of the public safety are interesting examples of the convenient device of making clamor take the place of thought.” And then Broun says on his own account, “Just wave the Stars and Stripes and everything will be all right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some sections of the country are quicker than others to go into hysterics when the flag-waving starts. It is now eight years since a home in Seattle was broken up because a child, Russell Tremain, refused to salute the flag, was torn from his parents by a court order, and transported to a distant part of the state. The Oregon </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal,</span><span class="font11"> referring to that piece of cruelty and asininity said, bitterly, “and a jury acquitted Albert Fall 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same subject was up in Virginia, and the board of education of that state had sense enough to see that the question of compulsory flag-saluting was not within its jurisdiction. This impressed the Virginia </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Pilot,</span><span class="font11"> one of the leading papers of Virginia, to say, “It is far less important to the inculcation of downright Americanism in the rising generation to insist that everybody salute the flag at nine o’clock in the morning than it is to insist that nothing be done at any time, in school or out, to humiliate one because of his religious beliefs or to compel one to do anything that his religious convictions forbid.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It was ten miles out of Boston that the incident occurred which is quoted from the Boston </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font11"> elsewhere in this issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font11">The parents of the eight-year-old Nichols boy, explaining why they did not wish to coerce him, wrote to the principal of the school the following, which ought certainly to appeal to any true American. “We send our son to school for the purpose of being educated. We, his parents, reserve custody over our son’s religion. We regard compulsory salutation of the flag, together with the compulsory pledge which accompanies it, as a violation of God’s law. Our opinion on this point cannot be changed ... In deference to the flag and in deference to God’s law, which is unmistakably made known to us in the Bible, we considered this our parental duty not to allow our son to attend school last Friday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This story has found its way into every newspaper in the country, including the local Lynn press, which admitted that “almost simultaneously City Solicitor Patrick F. Shannahan stated that he had been unable to discover any law on the statute books which compelled a pupil to pledge allegiance to the flag or sing the national anthem”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the scores of clippings on this item which have been received at the office of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> the only ones that have criticized either the boy or his parents were “Rev.” Laurence B.

<p><span class="font11">A considerable proportion of the officers and men of the navy are Roman Catholics, and when Roman Catholic services are being held on battleships of the United States navy the flag of the pope is always flown above the Stars and Stripes. This matter was up for discussion in the United States Senate in the month of February, 1929. A complete history of the discussion will be found beginning at page 2850 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font11"> Seventieth Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among the speakers on that occasion was David I. Walsh, United States senator for Massachusetts, who, doubtless honestly, but mistakenly thinking that the pope’s flag is the flag of Jehovah God, said: “Mr. President, it is regrettable that an issue of this kind should have been raised, and I should have remained silent and said nothing had it not been that the debate has taken the appearance of an entirely different motive and purpose than would apparently appear to one who simply read the amendment. The issue now is, Will we repudiate the recognition in the navy of a power and influence above all nations and all sects—a Supreme Being? ... I for one refuse to depart from the time-honored American custom of placing the emblem of God above every other emblem in the world. I will not haul down the pennant of God for any other emblem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Senate sustained Senator Walsh by a vote of 68 to 10, with 17 not voting, and the flag of the pope continues to fly above the United States flag, on the battleships of the United States navy, whenever the priest aboard is conducting what passes for divine service, but is not divine service even in any remote sense of the word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font11">T IS evident that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font11"> Huntington, Indiana, is badly tangled. Speaking of the Catholic religion it says in one breath that it “has produced the great majority of those persons whom the world considers holy men and saints” and in the next breath it says that same “church” is continually attacked because it represents Christ, who was not of this world. Why quote the world as an authority in favor of the “church” and in the same story try to prove that its testimony is not to be believed? The same issue tells the strange tale that “the Catholic church has ever been a most powerful champion of all true liberty”. The journal does not quote its fellow Catholic periodical, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Morning Star, </span><span class="font11">of New Orleans, La., wherein the latter refers to the American charter of liberty as a “lying constitution”, nor does it mention the 50,000,000 liberty-lovers who have died because they would not bow down to the Roman Hierarchy. However, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Visitor</span><span class="font11"> does tell one great truth. It says that “the Catholic church has existed for nearly two thousand years without once having to revise its doctrines with the progress of kno-wledge”. That is a long time to go without learning anything, but the Devil can beat even that record. He has gone about three times as long and is in the same predicament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A Cheer for Carleton</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[Editorial in the Baltimore </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun,</span><span class="font9"> September 28,1935]</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A</span><span class="font11">T Lynn, Massachusetts, 8-year-old Carleton</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nichols has precipitated a municipal crisis by refusing to salute the flag, according to the statute in such case made and provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It seems that there is a law in Massachusetts providing that the flag shall be saluted and “America” sung at least once a week by every pupil in the public schools; if they fail, principal and teachers are subject to heavy pains and penalties. Again, if any child is prevented from attending school, principal and teachers are likewise subject to heavy pains and penalties. Now Carleton has refused to salute; and he cannot be expelled, because that would be preventing him from attending school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For our part, we glory in Carleton’s spunk. Any statute requiring that the flag be saluted by school children is an insult to the Stars and Stripes, and ought to be resented by all patriots. Is our national ensign a swastika flag, to be respected only by forced salutes? Since when has the Star-Spangled Banner so lost the respect of the people over whom it flies that laws are necessary to make them pretend to honor it ? What a disgraceful thing it is to assume that the flag would not be saluted if people were not afraid to refuse the tribute of respect!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The flag that flew at Yorktown, and at Fort McHenry, and at Chapultepec, and at Santiago, and at Vimy Ridge and St. Mihiel is not yet the flag of a totalitarian state that pretends to no right to exist save the might of the clenched fist. It is supposed to be the flag of free men. It is supposed to float because its people have raised it of their own free will and uphold it out of preference—not because they fear it, but because they love it. If the time has come when they must be compelled to pay it a formal and forced tribute, then the time has come to haul it down and hoist in its place some red or black banner of dictatorship, of force and fear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N December 1933 we started compiling records. Up till September 1934 there were 12 club meetings, 2 Y.M.C.A. meetings, and 1 meeting in a hospital</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In October 1934 we had 4 meetings; in November, 17 meetings; in December, 21; in January, 40; and in February, 59; a total of 141 meetings from October to February, with an attendance of 5,353 strangers, fully 60 percent of whom were Roman Catholics. At these meetings 247 books and 1,021 booklets were taken and paid for, and, in addition, 1,078 booklets and 49 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Harps</span><span class="font7"> were given free, giving a total of placements of 296 books and 2,099 booklets. This week alone, from Sunday till Thursday we have had 18 meetings, with a total attendance of 900 strangers. At one of these meetings there was an attendance of 400.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">To begin with, a district is selected and a number of brethren are asked to locate and make a list of every club, lodging-house and meetingplace in that district. When the list is completed it is given to a sister, who is asked to call</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and arrange meetings. We have found that sisters are more suitable than brothers for this work. One sister alone in the Glasgow company has fixed up over 100 of these meetings. Other sisters are now coming forward to help with this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When asked regarding her method of procedure, she replied: “I go to the address, knock at the door, and walk right in. I go up to the first group of men I see and ask, ‘Can I see the secretary of this club?’ If he is not in, I ask for a member of the committee, and the men may turn and call, ‘Here, Geordie! Here’s a lady to see ye.’ I tell him that we have a very interesting lecture called ‘World Control’, by Judge Rutherford, which we have given in nearly</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">9th March 1935</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. R. G. Burton,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bear Bro. Burton,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I now have pleasure in sending you a report of the work being done among the clubs in Glasgow, as requested in your letter of 21st Feb'y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report has been compiled mainly from data given at last Thursday's service workers' meeting. This meeting was originally arranged for the previous Thursday, but had to be cancelled owing to a number of important club fixtures which came in for that night and which necessitated a number of the principal workers' being absent that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As you will see from the report the gaining of an entrance is mainly a question of tact and method. Sister Annie McLennan, who has done most of the arranging, has a fine bright and breezy manner and keeps herself smart and attractive, and I believe this has been a considerable factor in her success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am sorry I have no letters of appreciation to send you meantime. These may possibly come forth later. At present we have to push our way into most of the places because of misrepresentation and misunderstanding. From the report you will see that thi s is being broken down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I cannot say that the clubs have affiliated clubs elsewhere, but it is almost certain that similar clubs exist in all parts. Wherever we go we stress the fact that we are giving the Watch Tower programme, and not a religious service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With warm love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours in Jehovah's service, [Signed] A. M. Greenlees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to bring it here and give it to you. It will be preceded and followed by an interesting program of music. The whole thing is a splendid entertainment lasting about an hour. Now we want to bring it here. What evening would suit you? Tuesday at 8 p.m.? Very well, I will send you a notice to put on your notice board so that all the members will know about it. You want to know what it is about? Well, I am not here to tell you that. You will hear all about it on Tuesday.’ I tell them as little as possible about the lecture. I have very often to make a second call to see the secretary and get the date fixed. I send them a notice to reach them on the morning it is to be given. If sent before the time, it may mean a cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I have many amusing experiences. At a rifle club I got an invitation to go back and learn to shoot. At a boxing club I was told this was Johnny MacMillan’s club, and was invited to come back and see a boxing match. They promised to arrange a lecture at some time he was present and assured us of a crowded house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Personal Calls Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When this work commenced 36 letters were sent to various clubs. Only one reply was received, and that unfavorable. We have found by experience that the only way to get into these clubs is by a personal call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the machine is being carried, three brothers go with it. If taken in a car, two are sufficient. We start with two musical records; then an announcement regarding the lecture “World Control” is made. We usually state, among other things: “You may not agree with everything that is said, but we have brought this lecture to you believing that you are all strong believers in free speech and freedom of the press and therefore we feel sure that you will give the lecture a good hearing and at the end we shall be very pleased to answ<sup>r</sup>er any questions you may have to put along the lines of the lecture.” Immediately after the lecture we put on another musical item. This serves to smooth down any ill feeling that may have arisen amongst Roman Catholics, etc. Then questions are invited and answered. We tell them about the literature, of which we always have an ample supply on hand. To close we put on some popular song, like Harry Lauder’s “Keep Right On to the End of the Road”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reaches a Class Hitherto Untouched</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This work has proved to be a wonderful means of getting in touch with a class of people who have never heard our message and who are not reached in the ordinary service work. Much interest has been shown and great appreciation expressed. For example: In one instance the lecture was put on at 9:15 p.m., and at 11:30 p.m. we were still answering questions. There were 19 present at that meeting, and five sets of books, comprising </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> and three booklets, were placed. In another instance, w’here 39 men were present, 73 pieces of literature were left. The club bought five units for the use of the members. At a large lodginghouse 400 men were present and 157 pieces of literature were left. At another club, with an attendance of 28 strangers, 52 books and booklets were placed and 12 booklets given away free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another working men’s club we had to wait until a billiard tournament was finished, and then the men turned their chairs round to hear our lecture. As they listened many of them were drinking beer. Six units and 32 single booklets were placed here, and we had to call back with more books and booklets to supply the demand. The gentleman in charge asked us to come back again, and told us that the two Labor M.P.’s “Jimmy” Maxton and “Davie” Kirkwood were members of this club and he would see that they were present when next we arranged a meeting there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Church of Scotland Club in Renfrew the lecture started at 9 o’clock and at 10: 55 we were still answering questions. The chairman, in proposing a vote of thanks, said he had learned more in that short time than he had learned all the years he had gone to church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had a very interesting experience at a Co-operative Guild meeting in Johnstone. They advertised it in the local paper as “I.B.S.A. and the League of Nations”. We don’t know where they got this! The meeting started at 8 p.m. In introducing us the chairman said that he really did not know what his visiting friends were going to give them. The lecture was given, and then the questions commenced. At 10:20 p.m. the chairman said that out of consideration for us he thought they should draw the meeting to a close. It had been one of the most interesting and enjoyable guild meetings he had ever attended. He had learned more that evening about the Bible than he had learned all his days since leaving school. The organizer said that he would write an article for the Co-operative paper telling about the splendid Watch Tower Program and advising all other guilds to avail themselves of our services. There were 25 members present that night, but he would guarantee that on our return the hall would be packed when the report of this splendid lecture and discussion had been published. Incidentally, they offered to pay our expenses' coming from Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Examples of Questions Asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Examples of the questions which we got at that meeting are as follows: Why was Judge Butherford so much against the League of Nations, which had been organized to carry on the work of the Prince of Peace? What would be our attitude in the event of another war in the time of trouble we said was just ahead? What were our views with regard to spiritism? How did we get over the fact that these mediums could accurately foretell coming events? Why is it that at all military parades there is a clergyman in the very center of things swanking a row of medals and yet claiming to represent the Prince of Peace? Do you suggest that we should stand by and do nothing for the betterment of our fellow men since Armageddon is so near and the League of Nations of the Devil?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On a Sunday evening recently we gave the lecture at a meeting of the Scottish Covenanters. They evidently did not know what they were going to get. The chairman announced that they would hear “wireless, radio, music and other things”. About 80 persons were present, who, we were informed, had just come from “a very nice service in the Barrowfield church”. While the record was being changed the chairman announced that they would now take the collection (for themselves, not us). Questions followed after the talk, and as a result we were invited to arrange for two further meetings to discuss questions dealing with the resurrection and the trinity, and this we agreed to do on the understanding that Brother Butherford’s lecture would introduce the subject on each evening. The closing remarks of the chairman spoke of the wonders of wireless and how fine a thing it was that many lying on sick beds could enjoy this splendid program. (He evidently thought that our program had come over the air.) It was not often that they had the privilege of hearing such an outstanding speaker as Judge Butherford, and they were very grateful to us for giving them the opportunity of hearing him. They wished us every success in this splendid Christian work we were engaged in. This meeting was closed with an evangelistic hymn and a benediction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Appreciative Catholic Audiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have been twice to the Tontine Working Men’s Hotel, where we had audiences of 140 and 100, most of them Catholics. This is a hotel which has not formerly allowed any religious meetings of any kind. On the second occasion the manager told us that after our first meeting he was visited by people from the Church of Scotland, the Salvation Army, the Boman Catholics and the missions demanding to be allowed the same privilege as we had obtained. The manager’s reply to them was: “These people are different from you.” After the second meeting one man told us that he had obtained a twopenny booklet at the first lecture and had changed it five times with other men who had different booklets, so that he had now read six booklets in all. It was in the reading of these booklets that for the first time he had gained any comfort from religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a corporation lodging-house in Paisley there were 110 men present. Our brother was called into the side room and questioned by the superintendent as to the nature of the lecture. Ninety-five percent of the men, he said, were Boman Catholics and he hoped that nothing would be said to “shock their susceptibilities”. The brother informed the superintendent that we had given this program in the Tontine Working Men’s Hotel, where the majority of the men were also Catholics, and it was so much appreciated that we were invited back. On that occasion we were told that the second meeting had been even better than the first. The brother was then informed that the platform party was ready. He found that he was to be supported in the chair by a town councilor and several ladies and gentlemen. At the end of the lecture questions were invited, and the first question was: “Why was Judge Butherford allowed to come here when he was the greatest opponent of religious peace in the world today?” Another question was: “Why was Judge Butherford opposed to the doctrine of the immaculate conception?” To that question the brother tactfully replied that that was a very big and important question which was not covered by the lecture, but if the questioner cared to come forward at the end of the meeting he would be pleased to hand him free of charge a booklet which dealt fully with the matter. On our departure the two R.C.’s who asked the above questions gave us a hearty send-off and said they would look forward to our next visit. In bringing the meeting to a close the town councilor said it had been a most enjoyable evening. He hoped to have us back again. The superintendent also said that as the second Tontine Hotel meeting had been even better than the first he hoped we would come back for a second meeting here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Most Unusual Audiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The proprietor of a large dance hall in the city has invited us to give the lecture there next Sunday. 1,200 bills have been printed advertising it, and he is arranging to distribute these and is announcing the meeting at all the dances held in the hall during the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have held a meeting in the Pearce Institute, Govan, which is controlled by the clergy. When the brother arrived with the machine there was a parson in charge of a game of carpet bowls. When the lecture started he sat down with the others. Then when it came to the League of Nations he rose and went out. Towards the end another parson came in, listened for a few minutes, and also went out. An interesting discussion followed the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two lectures have been given in the Ralston Hospital for permanently disabled soldiers. There were 22 men present on the second occasion, lying on invalid chairs, some with no legs, some with no arms, others covered with bandages. Following the lecture there was a most interesting discussion lasting for over an hour. It was evident that their experiences had made these men think. One question asked was: “Is it possible to be a politician and a Christian at the same time?” They entirely agreed with our emphatic “No”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another meeting in a lodging-house we met a man who told us that his brother, a bus driver, was a great believer in the Truth. He was unable, owing to his duties, to get to the meetings, but he was doing all he could to spread the message by handing out the booklets and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> wherever he went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the smaller clubs we visit are in disused washhouses, condemned buildings, sunk flats and army huts, lit sometimes only by candles or oil lamps. Here we meet poverty in its direst forms. In such places the booklets are offered free to any interested. The message is always very welcome here, and greatly appreciated. In an old men’s club in such a place the lecture was given and then questions were invited. One man stood up and said: “No, friend, I don’t think there will be any questions here about that. We are all agreed on it, and the sooner it comes the better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More Interesting Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a Church of Scotland social club a number of very interesting questions were asked, including : ‘What is meant by the statement in the lecture, ‘Millions now living will never die’?” (In passing, we might mention that this is a question which is asked at almost every club.) “What is meant by the world’s ending in 1914?” “The League of Nations?” “Why is Judge Rutherford the only man on earth who has such a splendid knowledge of the Scriptures ?” “What is meant by the everlasting covenant?” ‘What does Judge Rutherford mean by the statement in his lecture ‘the wanton slaughter of animals, which was done chiefly from greed for gain’?” “Why did God give us a Bible so difficult to understand?” “The permission of evil?” “How might we pass through the battle of Armageddon?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have found at a large number of meetings that the remark is made: “We did not appreciate what Judge Rutherford’s message was until this lecture was given and these questions were answered. It is the most reasonable explanation we have ever heard of present world conditions and the Scriptures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Frequent Return Engagements</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting point we might mention is that we have been back at over 30 clubs, showing that the Watch Tower Program has been greatly appreciated. We might also mention that the social club movement in this part was organized mainly by the clergy to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In times past when the “Millions” message was being proclaimed world-wide we endeavored to get into the model lodging-houses in our district but were unsuccessful. It is only because of the use of the transcription machines that this door of opportunity has been opened to us. No one who has any part in this work could fail to be enthused by it. It gives an insight into humanity that nothing else could do. It has proved itself to be a means of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom to the very poor, and ‘the poor have heard it gladly’.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>The Fight for Freedom of Conscience</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE fight for freedom to worship God according to the dictates of one’s conscience continues in New Jersey, where, it seems, the greatest and most terrible earthly enemy of that freedom is determined to establish a precedent that will abrogate it. In the following letter an observer of certain occurrences in Plainfield puts the issue squarely up to the governor of New Jersey. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> readers will note with amazement the lengths to which the Hierarchy and its accomplices will go to suppress the truth. Unless the encroachments of the Papal emissaries are resisted with strong determination it is not at all unreasonable to anticipate the return of the days when the consciences of men and women were coerced with frightful tortures. Have “Protestants” forgotten the Inquisition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">H. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.</span><span class="font6"> Hoffman,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Governor of New Jersey, Trenton, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thank you for so promptly answering the telegram sent by eleven of my friends and signed by myself. This related to Mrs. Lena Albright and her incarceration in Plainfield, later in the county jail at Elizabeth, N. J., where to my understanding she still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Permit me to correct your evident misunderstanding of the reason for Mrs. Albright’s arrest. You were certainly misinformed as to her activities in Plainfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have just taken up my residence in New York, having disposed of my personal interests in five broadcasting stations in Ohio. As an owner and manager, I had ample opportunity of experiencing the embarrassment of the subtle, underhand opposition to activities (by radio and otherwise) of Jehovah’s witnesses, by selfish interests, particularly the Roman Catholic group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cleveland the radio station (of which I was president and general manager), because of broadcasting programs furnished by Jehovah’s witnesses, was subjected to a subtle boycott by Roman Catholic leaders and those whom they could influence. One of the nation’s leading newspapers, part owner of that radio station, was similarly embarrassed, and pressure was brought to bear from prominent Roman Catholic leaders to have the newspaper, as an owner, to withhold use of the station from Jehovah’s witnesses. Priests advised their parishioners to refuse to purchase anything from sponsors who used the station. I have hundreds of letters testifying to that fact, and which letters I shall be very happy to submit to you personally, if you so desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From a careful investigation of the New Jersey situation, I am satisfied that the same un-American influence is behind the arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses in your community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present I am interested in gathering correct data regarding the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and especially in New Jersey, for the purpose of supplying by electrical transcription such information to three hundred radio stations weekly throughout the United States. In this same connection I have found that about three million people have just petitioned Congress to supply them with a copy of information now before the Senate committee regarding the attempted suppression of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, especially by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the quest for correct information, I was personally present at the trial of Mrs. Lena Albright in Plainfield. She was charged with violation of a city ordinance designed purely to regulate distribution of newspapers, periodicals, magazines, circulars, etc., and which ordinance is good for the purpose written. However, that ordinance was surely never intended to apply to such a case as that of Mrs. Albright’s. It was apparent from testimony that Mrs. Albright was distributing nothing. The record shows that counsel for the defense, on examination, brought out that Mrs. Albright left nothing at any place unless requested to do so by the person visited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The personal prejudice and bias of the police judge, William De Meza, was displayed in his statement to defense counsel, as follows</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">: “I</span><span class="font6"> will allow it, and grant you an exception; </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">fight it out on appeal.”</span><span class="font6"> Such an expression, made before the trial was slightly more than half over, clearly shows Mrs. Albright was </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">convicted</span><span class="font6"> before her trial; else why an </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">appeal?</span><span class="font6"> Appeal from what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mrs. Albright was not permitted by the prosecutor, William Newcorn, to state </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">why</span><span class="font6"> she was in Plainfield. The prosecutor, aided by the court, would permit to go into the record only that which tended to show that Mrs. Albright was in Plainfield for the purpose of distributing circulars, and nothing else, and that she was being prosecuted for not having obtained a permit from the police. I shall be glad to hear what has appeared to you in your further investigation of this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">M. A. H----</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">, Brooklyn, N.</span><span class="font6"> Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Be Ordered by the Gross</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Men’s League of Mercy of the United States gave the pope a bronze medal for fixing it up with Almighty God to grant repose to the soul of a murderess electrocuted at Sing Sing. As most murders in the United States are committed by members of the same church, it seems as if the wise thing to do would be to order these medals by the gross and send one to Italy every time there is a public execution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By DR. FREDERIC FUNDER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Vienna Correspondent, N.C.W.C. News Service}</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">V</span><span class="font7">IENNA, April 10.—The “International Society of Bible Students,” which has its headquarters in Brooklyn, N. Y., has been active in Austria in the last year and its officials boast of having flooded Austria with 266,000 books and 100,000 copies of their periodical. Joseph F. Rutherford of Brooklyn is the head of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The press products of the organization are issued from Switzerland. The books adorned with fantastic illustrations in which the clergy of the Christian churches, above all Catholic priests, are presented as the helpers and friends of capitalism and militarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a paper, entitled “Proclamation,” said to have been printed in 1,400,000 copies in Switzerland, the following is stated: “The pagan religions are devilish and extremely horrible, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">defamation of God as well. But Christianity is far worse and casts still greater disgrace on the name of God. Therefore the demand is made ever and ever again that the power of Christianity be broken as it is a horror in the eyes of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Year Book of the group, just published, deals with its activities in the various countries of the world. In it is contained this statement on Mexico:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For centuries the Roman Catholic church wielded absolute power. In recent years, however, the people freed themselves of those fetters, yet the cunning influence of those religious fanatics is still remarkable. 1934 was a blessed year and the result went beyond our expectations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of Austria, the Year Book says: “The preaching of Truth in Austria continues to take place amidst great difficulties. Wherever the Devil’s black representatives are at work, there is darkness, and gloom broods over the people. Yet, in spite of all, light begins to penetrate into the hearts of some of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In their Almanac, it is asserted that in Czechoslovakia 150,000 more copies of booklets were circulated than in the preceding year, or 452,492 in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Poland, it is asserted, 268,292 booklets were distributed last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to Jugoslavia, “some progress” is reported to have been made. On Italy the authors of the Almanac discharge the full vials of their anger, saying: “In that country of darkness are the headquarters of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. That tool of the Devil has its representatives in all departments of the government.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Success of the Holy Year”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ERE is a Catholic Action church paper, from Cambridge, Ohio, that gives the following interesting information. It will be specially appreciated by the one-half of all the workers in the United States that are out of work: “Last year in April at Rome the ‘holy year’ was inaugurated with great pomp and solemnity. The ‘holy year’ of 1933 commemorated the nineteenth century of man’s redemption. It was the fond wish and hope of the ‘holy father’ that the celebration of the ‘holy year’ would bring peace to souls and true prosperity to all peoples. This wish has been at least partially realized. People had drifted away from God and, therefore, He sent the depression to bring them back to their senses. The object of the flioly year’ was to ask God to give back prosperity to our people. God has answered our prayers in so far as we have again recognized him as the true God. And now at the end of the ‘holy year’ we are asked to pray for ‘the success of the “holy year” ’, namely, that the bounteous fruits which have come from it may grow to full and abiding maturity. Since the ‘holy year’ has been so successful the pope has extended it for another year so that all the people may gain the indulgences attached to it.” The same paper tells of a little boy in France that “at the age of four he put stones in his shoes to mortify himself and suffer just a tiny bit for Jesus”. Folks here in Brooklyn seem to think Jesus is just as well pleased if little boys put splintered glass in their shoes instead of gravel, but maybe gravel is all right in France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">League of Prayer for the Conversion of America </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fJlHE MISSIONARY,</span><span class="font7"> Washington, D.C., pub--*■ lished by the Catholic Missionary Union, devotes a column to the League of Prayer for the Conversion of America. One of the directors is the Very Reverend John B. Harney, C.S.P., who, as spokesman for the Hierarchy, is down in black and white as advocating the murder of those who antagonize the outfit with which he is connected. It should be explained that these prayers ascend to the one designated in the Scriptures as “the god of this world”, referred to by Jesus as “the prince of this world”. This conversion business, once it gets under way, ought to be interesting to “milk and water” Protestants who believe Harney and his friends should have all the rope they seek. In Vienna alone, since the machine-gun method of conversion went into effect, it is claimed that in one year 30,000 socialists returned to the church. As between salvation by the “purgatory” route and being shot full of holes, many socialists (exCatholics) prefer the “salvation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Flower from the Garden of the Jesuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Jesuit’s Conception of Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE following comparison between Christ and the pope was made in an article which appeared in the Yugoslavian publication, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The Messenger of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,”</span><span class="font7"> on page 41 of No. 2 for 1935. The magazine is published by Jesuits who assure its readers “that ‘The Messenger’ has the magic power to open heaven itself to those who read it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ had only 12 apostles, but the pope has 70 cardinals. Christ had but to look after a handful of faithful ones, such as Lazarus, Nicodemus, and a few pious women, while the pope has to look after 400,000,000 of Catholics. By order of the eternal Father, Christ was only allowed to preach to the Jews in Palestine, while the pope spreads his missions to the whole earth. After three years of public activity Christ had won such a small number of Jews that finally he died all alone, for even the apostles had left him. On the other hand, after 10 years of rulership, Pope Pius XI had won over 6,000,000 heathen for the church of Christ. Christ was but able to make saints of John the Baptist and one of the thieves, but the popes, thanks be to God, filled our calendar with thousands and thousands of glorious divine saints. By the will of the eternal Father, Christ was only permitted to stay for three years on the earth, while Pope Pius XI, thanks be to God, reigns already 4 times 3 years. By order of the eternal Father, Christ was not permitted to receive homage from the delegations of heathen countries, but the pope receives homage from all the states, which even send their representatives and ambassadors to him. Christ appointed to bishops the 11 apostles only (Judas was not appointed a bishop), but each pope, even if he ruled only for a few months, had opportunity to send out a far greater number of servants of God into the world. Thanks be to God that the pope has got a palaee! Where would he otherwise accommodate so many collaborators who assist him in extending the kingdom of Christ? Thanks be to God that the pope does not go barefooted! What a shame it would be for us 400 million Catholics if we would not be able to buy our pope the best shoes! Thanks be to God that the pope has a car! If in America every worker can afford one, why should not our pope have one too ? If it is possible, we shall also buy him an aeroplane. Thanks be to God, thanks be to God that the pope is different from Christ in many unessential things. This shows that the church of Christ is no more a bare, little tree, but a big and mighty one. This is the sign that the pope is indeed the disciple of Christ. Therefore it is necessary to obey him. And we will obey him and love him! For he is the second Christ on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What the Apostolic Delegate Had On</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Cicognani has been to Cincinnati. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cincinnati </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font7"> tells what he had on. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The apostolic delegate will be clothed in a white lace alb bound by a purple girdle, his pectoral cross studded with jewels, a stole covering his shoulders and over these a long tunic with white leggings ornamented with gold, white slippers, the embroidered chasuble, white gloves and over these latter his episcopal ring. After the master of ceremonies places on the legate’s head the mitre, or high headpiece worn by bishops, the apostolic delegate will proceed to the foot of the altar to begin mass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of plowing under so much cotton the price of overalls has about doubled, and many a poor farmer who has no other kind of clothes than overalls is wondering how in creation he is going to get through another season without looking far worse than Mr. Cicognani did.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Port of New York Authority owes New Jersey $8,000,000, but when the New Jersey House of Assembly wanted an investigation it was opposed by John J. Rafferty, Roman Catholic floor leader of the Democratic minority, and one wonders if his reason for opposing the investigation was the same reason as for proposing huge fines for anybody who criticizes in any manner the biggest humbug on earth, the papal one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cadman's Opinion of the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N UTTER contempt of the Bible Reverend</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S. Parkes Cadman is on record as telling a grieving father or mother, desirous of truth, “Under no circumstances, least of all such as yours, should the book of Ecclesiastes be consulted for light upon the hereafter.” As to why the book was written he said: “Fortunately, you can leave that to experts.” As to who wrote the books which Jesus said were written by Moses, he said that they “are a compilation of preexisting documents ranging in date from the eighth to the fourth centuries B.C.” As to the other book besides Ecclesiastes that was written by Solomon, and as to the Psalms which plainly declare their own authorship, he said: “The Psalms and Proverbs are also compilations of literary material belonging to various epochs between the fifth and second centuries B.C.”; and “Daniel and Ecclesiastes belong to the second century B.C.” In other words, he thinks the Bible is what those who love God think Cadman himself is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Substitute for Heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, addressing the Clergy Association of New York and Neighborhood, said he hoped to find some rich man who would put up a $5,000,000 house for the clergy in New York city, endowed with a library of 500,000 volumes, where these men with nothing to do during the week could have a place to come and toast their shins. Cadman said, “I would like to have a place where the great lessons taught by the Roman Catholic church could be learned.” Isn’t it wonderful how Peter and those other non-Catholics got along without big libraries? It says that the people ‘took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and learned of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Him’.</span><span class="font7"> Cadman may have taken offense at Jesus’ statement, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.”</span></p>

Believing that all governments are parts of Christ’s kingdom it would therefore propose that Christ should run the munition factories at least indirectly; and that, at least, has the attraction of novelty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7"> CORRESPONDENT in Asheville, N. C., sends in a clipping telling of an Arkansas clergyman who stole a marriage license from the county clerk’s office, forged the deputy county clerk’s name to it, and then used it, after which he fled to Tennessee. He then says: “It seems as though the ‘Reverends’ out in the West are having a hard time of it, when they can’t slip enough out of the regular snitch to buy a license; or is it that he just can’t be honest?” In this are some things hard to be understood, but it doth appear that maybe this preacher stole this only to keep some good girl from going wrong; for the story goes on to say that the girl who was married with the preacher’s stolen license was married to the preacher himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N DEFENDING himself in a divorce case a San Antonio minister denied the paternity of his thirteen-month-old son, and denied he had ever married his wife. Then the state got busy and arrested him for perjury, faced him in court with the judge who had married him, the county clerk who had issued the marriage license, and the doctor who had examined the lady who became his wife, and notified the “Reverend” that she was about to become a mother and that marriage was in order. The “Reverend” was given seven years in prison, for lying on the witness stand. Ministers get so used to lying about God one day in the week that they cannot understand why it is wrong to lie about others whenever the spirit moves them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Events in Canada </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE inequality by which Quebec and Ontario have maintained a throttle hold on the other provinces of Canada is causing more and more discontent as economic conditions grow worse. Under the caption “A Growing Danger” the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font7"> editorially refers to the matter as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The dangers of interprovineial strife arising under the Natural Products Marketing Act are beginning to be realized throughout the Dominion. It has been brought forcibly to attention by the proposal coming from British Columbia to so regulate products as to exclude those from other provinces. In the Pacific coast province the demand is a direct, frank quest for protection against competition from other parts of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The danger was pointed out in these columns at the time the measure came before the House of Commons. It has now come closer to a reality, and if each province proceeds to afford its own industry protection against competition from other parts of Canada it will place a terrific strain upon confederation. In that event, Stephen Leacock’s remarks about Canada’s being Balkanized would not be so far fetched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A Century of Progress” in Free Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an article appearing in the press upon the suppression of freedom of speech in Canada a hundred years ago, Fred Williams states :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On December 10, 1820, the Kingston </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> contained a report on the trial of a Niagara editor for 'libel on the government’. Barnabas Ferguson was editor of the Niagara </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span><span class="font6"> and he had dared to comment upon the actions of the council at Toronto in some trifling matter. A warrant was issued for his arrest and he was lodged in the old jail at Niagara. He was tried at the assizes and he was convicted, whereupon the chief justice, William Dummer Powell, condemned him to be imprisoned for 18 months, to stand in the pillory on a stated date, “to be there an object of public obloquy,’’ to pay a fine of 50 pounds or remain in prison until it was paid, and, if released, to give a bond to “conserve the peace’’ for seven years, himself in 500 pounds and two sureties of 1,250 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unfortunate journalist suffered the pains of prison, went through the indignity of public exhibition in the pillory for a whole day, and might have stayed in jail until he rotted had not compassion seized the governor and Sir Peregrine Maitland remitted the bond on the condition that Ferguson left the country. Such was “liberty” in early Upper Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The implication is that that was a terrible condition to prevail in any civilized country, and all will agree, but are conditions in the land any better today? Three months ago two of Jehovah’s witnesses, because of proclaiming by printed page the message of God’s kingdom and declaring His judgments as written against this unrighteous order, were declared guilty of having part in a seditious conspiracy and sentenced to two months in prison and a fine of $300. Twelve more of the same group were charged with disturbing the peace and sentenced to fifteen days in jail for handing out pamphlets telling of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">17,000 Turn Out to Hear “Radical”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prison bars cannot stop the onward march of truth any more than they can stop the rising storm of discontent against the present injustices in the earth. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix, </span><span class="font7">speaking upon radical developments in this land, editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Tim Buck was turned out of Kingston penitentiary and returned to Toronto, 4,000 persons met him at the station, a larger number than, with few if any exceptions, meets a prime minister of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few days later when he made a public speech 17,000 persons attended, a larger number than ever before attended a political meeting in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to Prevent Diphtheria</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the heading &quot;Child Dies After Inoculation of Diphtheria Serum” the Provost (Alberta) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Inoculated with diphtheria antitoxin on Saturday, along with his father and two other members of the household, Bobby Colton, 5-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Murray Colton, of Strand district, collapsed and died within half an hour, despite all efforts to save him. The family having been exposed to diphtheria through contact with a stricken patient, Mr. Colton considered it advisable to take any necessary precautions and called upon Dr. York, then visiting at the home of Martin Mareck, to come over and treat the Colton family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bobby appeared in the best of health, and ran out to meet the car as Dr. York and Mr. Colton drove up to the house, then went inside with the men. Keenly interested in the proceedings, the little chap looked on as his daddy was inoculated, and then sat playing with the medicine boxes as his own treatment was administered next. With customary precaution, in view of his extreme youth, only half the usual dose was administered. Bobby appeared quite cheerful and interested as others of the household were treated, but twenty or twenty-five minutes later began to cough violently. Seeing the child in distress, Dr. York rushed him outside into the fresh air and artificial respiration was applied in an effort to aid his breathing. After ten minutes or so the child was returned to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">house and restorative measures continued, but without effect. The ease was immediately reported by phone to Dr. Braithwaite, provincial coroner, in Edmonton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having been instructed by authorities of Hillcrest municipality to proceed to the infected district in order to arrange quarantines and administer inoculations, Dr. York received a fresh supply of diphtheria antitoxin from the provincial department of health on Saturday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An inquest is considered unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How Liars Figure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is an old and true saying, “Figures don’t lie, but liars do figure.” The capitalistic advocates are busy trying to impress the people with the great improvement of conditions, but it behooves us to “measure it properly”, as the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font7"> suggests we do in the following article under that heading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Care must be exercised in considering trade figures these days. They are not always what they seem, for the reason that the ordinary yardstick by which trade is measured is varying in its length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, statistics are made public every month showing Canada’s trade as compared with 1933 and 1932 or 1931. The figures are those of value in Canadian dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few years ago the Canadian dollar was still a gold dollar. It was at par or very nearly so with other gold currencies. Today the Canadian dollar is depreciated to approximately 60 percent of gold value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Canada’s trade is to be measured by its money value, then the measurement should be by a common standard or the values of the dollar in each year adjusted to a common basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Actually, if the trade statistics are to give a fair representation of trade the measurement should be by volume rather than by currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the volume produced that gives employment, and the benefit of trade to the country as a whole lies in the amount of employment it gives more than in the profit it yields to a limited number of individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Mr. Bennett proposes to fight the election on his trade policies, the statistics used must be such as to honestly present the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Promising Anything</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When seeking election some four years ago the present prime minister of Canada made many, many glowing promises, among which was that he would end unemployment within six months’ time or the government would perish in the attempt. Needless to say his promises were merely the promises of a politician and not fulfilled. Today on the eve of another election and in a frenzy to stay in office he has come forth with a platform of such sweeping changes that he has stolen all the “thunder” of the official opposition, also of the socialists and even of most of the radical element, and left them rubbing their eyes and pinching themselves to make sure they are awake and hearing aright. Outstanding among the statements in Mr. Bennett’s recent speech are the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As a lawyer I had to do, for more than thirty years, with big business and finance. I have some knowledge of finance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When in the past I praised it (the capitalist system), I did so with knowledge. When now I analyze it and point to its defects, I do so also with knowledge. Bear that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All I can tell you is that we will go just as far as is necessary to reform the system and make it effectively work again. I cannot bring myself to agree that there is anything radically wrong with the system which adjustment and reform will not remedy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Clearly, it would be unwise to circumscribe our activities by any attempted forecast of all that should be done. We can but move forward carefully.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I think there is, from all worthwhile points of view, an inequality in the distribution of income.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I believe there should be a uniform minimum wage and a uniform maximum working week. There must be an end to child labor. There must be an end to sweatshop conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“However few or many unemployed we normally may have, no man must be left to the uncertainties of private charity or to the humiliation of government gratuity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We are going to do away, as quickly as possible, with emergency relief measures and put in a permanent system of sound and scientific insurance against unemployment. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Dominion’s Hinterlands</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently there was held in Winnipeg a conference of the fur traders under the auspices of the Hudson’s Bay Company which was reported in the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font7"> as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Men of the North” who reach into Labrador’s wilds, forge through Arctic ice to lonely outposts, and visit isolated settlements in the Dominion’s hinterlands, have just concluded a gathering here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They sat about a long table, dressed in “civvies”, fingered letters and papers before them and appeared to be just another group of business executives discussing “minutes” and “amendments” at a directors’ meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But though the press was barred a reporter could visualize in the blue haze of cigar smoke above the score of heads (seen through an open door) the very out-of-the-ordinary things of which these men spoke. They were the fur traders of the Hudson’s Bay Company, gathered at Hudson’s Bay House for the annual fur trade conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They discussed such things as icebergs, privation, dog teams, Indians, isolation, frozen feet, Eskimos; they moved with ease from Labrador’s stormy coast to British Columbia’s wilds and north to Aklavik; they referred to berg-bruised ships and fur-laden canoes. Dangers and thrills of 12,000-mile trips through forest wilds and icebound waters were commonplace to these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Combating the Drmight</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an effort to combat the drought in the prairie provinces a Canadian conservation institute has been formed in Winnipeg concerning which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Mail and Empire</span><span class="font7"> editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">Canadian Conservation Institute has been formed in Winnipeg to enlist the best brains of the community in a campaign to combat the drought menace in the prairie provinces. It will organize and create a sound public opinion on this question, and will study and develop lines of attack. There is always the danger that if one or two years bring a good crop the importance of the measures to combat drought will be minimized in the public mind and the work left undone. The institute will keep alive the interest through wet years and dry until the task is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the organizers is Mr. W. L. MaeTavish, editor, the Winnipeg </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Tribune.</span><span class="font6"> In an address at Edmonton he pointed out that this year 87,000 farms are out of commission more or less—67,000 in Saskatchewan, 7,000 in Manitoba, and 13,000 in Alberta. Most of them have been out of commission for at least three years, some of them for four years, some even for five years. Roughly, the area of the drought covers 18,000,000 acres. It has an ordinary production in new wealth annually of from $150,000,000 to $200,000,000. Its production has been as high in value as $400,000,000 or more. Think for a moment what that means in terms of the prosperity of the country at large! Mr. MaeTavish declared that if the people drifted along there would be ultimately 20,000,000 acres of the finest hard wheat land in the world abandoned to the sow thistle and the gophers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The problem has been discussed by many experts in various lines. Mr. MaeTavish admits that he is not an expert, but from all the evidence and opinions he was able to get from others he is convinced that dams and trees are going to play a very large part in the rehabilitation of the West. But he is as firmly convinced, on the other hand, that changes in agricultural methods are necessary, that some of the land in the southern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan must go back to range land, that new drought resistant grasses must and can be developed, and that in general the agricultural experts of all kinds have a very great part to perform in the rehabilitation of the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What,” asks Mr. MaeTavish, “is the answer to be made to the forester, who comes along and points out that the Prince Albert area, for example, with its millions of trees to break the force of the wind and reduce evaporation, produced a heavy crop of wheat in 1934 on only an inch or two more rainfall than southern districts which produced no wheat at all?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Farmers Love the Mortgage Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reason why farmers love the mortgage companies can be gleaned from the following item quoted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Furrow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How a farmer paid $8,355.96 in 17 years on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">$6,000 mortgage and still owes $6,238.92 on it is recorded in a letter sent by a southern Saskatchewan farmer to a mortgage holder in Waterloo, Ont. The letter reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Received your notice calling for payment of $6,238.92. Some figures. This amount has grown from $4,000 in 1928, our last crop, to $6,238.92 this year. This is certainly some racket. I wish I could make money as fast. Your offer of giving $2.00 for every dollar paid on interest arrears is a step in the right direction, but of no avail, as we have no crop this year to pay anything; so you can put a few more figures on for next year; they look nice, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You will soon have it up to $10,000 on paper, and on paper it will remain unless you make a real adjustment of balance and give me a definite amount to pay, not one that grows by leaps and bounds, like a baby elephant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I will now list a few figures. As you know, the original loan, when assumed by me, was $6,000.” The letter then shows that on the original loan of $6,000 the farmer had paid a total of $8,355.96.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“They say figures don’t lie. Well, there they are on an original debt of $6,000. I have paid $8,355.96, and, according to notice, I still owe you more than I originally did. I may be dumb, but what I would like to know is, who the hell owns the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. . if this is a game, I’ll take the mortgage and you can have the land and you can pay me for a while. If you quote me a definite amount within reason which I will have to pay with no further interest, I will endeavor to get rid of it as soon as possible, but I am through shooting at a mark that continually moves and never can be reached. If this is not satisfactory, the headache is all yours. Try and make me pay.” The mortgage was placed in 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Taking the Profits Out of War</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With war clouds becoming darker in every land, many are the expressions in regard thereto. The following news item from Ottawa appeared in the Canadian Press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War was condemned today as a “monstrous evil” by Hon. J. J. Hughes (Lib., Prince Edward Island), who asked the Senate to approve a sweeping resolution affecting citizens and industries of the country in the event of Canada’s again going to war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His proposal advocated:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(a) Mobilization and conscription of all the “human power” and all material wealth of the nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(b) Establishment of a war council representing the provinces and the Dominion to have supreme control of war activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(c) Authority of the war council to assign men and women in Canada to whatever positions it thought they were best qualified to fill, but making as few changes as possible in their daily occupations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(d) Wages, salary or income “from the governorgeneral down”, including army officers, not to be greater than the pay of the common soldier in the field, plus a reasonable amount for dependents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(e) No money to be borrowed for war purposes, but all war expenses to be met by taxation and capital levies so as not to increase the country’s debt.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Adjournment of the debate was moved by Senator J. J. Murdoch (Lib., Ottawa). While the Senate adjourned until next Tuesday night, Senator Murdoch is not expected to speak before the latter part of next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unemployment a Permanent Thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking upon the same matter in the British Columbia legislature recently, Robert Connell, House leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Opposition, declared that unemployment is a permanent thing under our present system and ridiculed the proposal that the province get money from Ottawa without interest to provide work. “The people are now demanding,” he said, “not a new deal in the sense that it has been launched in the United States, but in the sense that people must come into their own right by owning the means of production and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I do not agree with Major Douglas and his social credit scheme, but I think he has hit one right point. The day is coming when we must have a national dividend.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Every citizen was entitled to his share of the national wealth. Mothers’ pensions, old age pensions, relief, should not be regarded as charity, but as a person’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Breaking Up the Dominion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the caption “Secession Movement Increasing” the Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font7"> quotes the following Canadian Press report from Vancouver :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the opinion of Alex. Manson (Lib., Omineca), a former attorney-general, the movement for secession of British Columbia from Confederation has been growing in ‘an amazing way’, he stated in the debate on the address in reply to the ‘speech from the throne’ in the legislature today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘A member of this House,’ he said, ‘when presenting British Columbia’s problems to a group of agriculturists was asked, “Why not secede?” He put the question to the assembly of farmers, and 90 percent of them were in favor of breaking away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘It is all very well for eastern Canada to sit back in complacency. The roots of the old parties are sunk deep in Ontario and Quebec, but political rebellion will ensue unless the bargain as between British Columbia and the East is revamped, ’ said Mr. Manson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘I trust I am a loyal Canadian, but I do not lay the stress upon national status that I did in my younger days. I think that too much nationalism has resulted in prohibitive tariff walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘Ordinarily I am not a secessionist. I know the difficulties in the way of secession. But if we are driven to it we must face the question and we can not and will not wait indefinitely for eastern Canada to come to its senses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘We are paying a tremendous toll to eastern Canada for our membership in Confederation. We are paying to manufacturers millions of profits, not only upon the cost of the material that goes into the commodities which we buy, and we are getting a pittance in return. We cannot continue to go into debt at an appalling rate for the benefit of eastern Canada.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“While British Columbia sells $4,500,000 worth of goods east of the Great Lakes, said Mr. Manson, it buys from eastern Canada $100,000,000 worth yearly. Its foreign exports, however, amounted to $47,500,000 in 1933, while its imports from foreign countries came to only $21,500,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kettle Serves as Radio Receiving Set</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Oakville, Ontario, we are informed by the press that steam comes out of the spout of Miss Ruth Lightbourn’s kettle, but the utensil is also capable of producing other things. During a heavy fog, fine orchestra music came from the water container as it sat on the stove. The program, which was audible eight feet away, lasted 20 minutes, then faded.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font7">OST PERSONS die young, having had only a brief taste of life. Almost all their days are spent in sorrow. Would you desire to live forever in a state of happiness, peace and health? Jehovah God has provided the way for men to have an opportunity for life, but men must learn that way before they can receive life in happiness. All persons have inherited death because of the wrongdoing of the first man. (Romans 5:12) Christ Jesus, by His death, redeemed the right of all persons to have life, but such persons must comply with the conditions before receiving life. Only through Christ Jesus can any person get life everlasting.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the crucifixion of Jesus until now God has been selecting a few persons whom He has made His witnesses, has given them an opportunity to prove their integrity toward Him by following in the footsteps of Jesus, and such as continue faithful until death receive everlasting life in heaven. The number thereof will be very small. Millions have died in total ignorance of God’s provision for men to have life, and these in due time will be awakened out of death that they may learn the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the second coming of Christ Jesus and His kingdom those living on earth are the first ones given an opportunity to learn the truth and to take their stand on the side of Christ Jesus and God. Thereafter all the dead will be awakened out of death and brought back to life on the earth and given an opportunity to learn and to obey the truth. All such as do obey will receive life on earth for ever. It is written in the Scriptures that the earth was created for man, and man for the earth, and in due time perfect men shall live on the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now Christ Jesus has come, and He is causing the truth to be brought to the attention of those today living on the earth and is thus giving them an opportunity to take their stand on the side of God and His kingdom before the Lord destroys the wicked of this world. Only those who do take their stand on the side of God and His kingdom, and who learn the truth and obey, will find life everlasting. It is written in the Scriptures: ‘Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.’ But no person can accept a gift until he has knowledge that the gift is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the present time Jehovah’s witnesses, under commandment from the Lord, are going throughout the land calling attention of the people to God’s provision to bless them with life and happiness. By the Lord’s grace these allimportant truths have been printed in books setting forth the texts of the Bible so that any person who desires may take his Bible with these books and learn the way to life. You cannot learn the way to life by listening to clergymen, because they teach the doctrines of men, which are contrary to the truths of God’s Word. You must learn the truth for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When you have decided that you want to be on the side of God and His kingdom of righteousness, then provide yourself with the Bible and these books which Jehovah’s witnesses bring to you explaining the Bible and study them yourself. If you sincerely desire to know the truth, and will ask the Lord to favor you with the truth, and then diligently apply yourself in study, the Lord will lead you fully into the truth and clearly show you the way to life. The time has now come when every person who will live must take his stand on the side of the Lord and His kingdom. The Devil and his agents will try to prevent you from learning the truth. Knowledge of the truth is your greatest asset. Let nothing hinder you from gaining a knowledge of the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first man created had the right to live, which right he lost because of disobedience. By inheritance all men have come under the disability resulting from the death sentence passed upon the first man. The way to life is this: Christ Jesus, by the grace of God, died in the place and stead of the sinner, and thereby bought the right of all men to live; God brings the attention of the people to the truth that they may learn and obey the way to life. Jesus declared: ‘I am the way, the truth and the life; and this is life eternal, to know God and Christ Jesus.’ It is impossible, therefore, to learn the way to life unless one gains a knowledge of the truth as set forth in God’s Word. The truth,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany and the Demons </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By a European Subscriber</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE recent article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> entitled “Germany Completely Under the Domination of Satan” prompts me to write to you in connection with an incident which I am now sorry I did not mention at the time of its occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly after the advent to power of the Nazi party, the leader of that party in East Prussia, Koch by name, unless my memory serves me false, stated at a gathering at Tilsit, as reported by the “Tilsiter Allgemeine Zeitung”: “Wir haben unser Ziel erreicht durch daemonischen Zwang” (We have arrived at our objective, or reached our aim, through the compulsion or force of the demons). Although it is nearly two years since I read the report, I am practically certain that I have quoted word for word accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thinking people in Germany realize that an inhuman power now controls the affairs of that country, but the only ones who realize just what that power is are those instructed in the Word of Jehovah. The law of the rubber truncheon and ox-hide whip emanates from the god of the Egyptian taskmasters, the master of the Babylonian “satraps”, the father of the murderers of the Lord Jesus and the originator of the present world order (or disorder) of oppression and fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">C. E. M. Joad, well-known English writer, recently received a letter from a friend hiding somewhere in Germany from the cruelties of the rulers of that land. This friend is an internationalist and pacifist and is described by Mr. Joad as a kind and charming personality. In his letter he mentioned that he longed to see his friends in England once again, but the Nazis had taken away his pass and he could not leave the country. He also mentioned that he could not meet his friends again, as he now had only half his face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the barbarous cruelties practiced by the followers of Hitler, it is not to be wondered at that a certain high-placed government official in Berlin recently admitted to a foreign diplomat that German prestige in other countries had reached zero.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Berlin,</span><span class="font6"> April 19 (AP).—The death penalty, it was announced today, will be invoked in Nazi Germany to exterminate pacifism in time of war or national emergency.</span></p>

In the capital watchmen are expected to be polite to thieves; and the bigger the thief, the more politeness must be shown.

Under the circumstances the citizens of York, paying, as they do, $1.66 for fifteen kilowatt hours of electricity, as against 60c for the very same service in the towns of equal population, such as Cleveland Heights and Lakewood, Ohio, and Holyoke, Massachusetts, are models of long-suffering hard to match.

As a result the rates dropped from 10c a kilowatt hour to 3c, and the people used so much more electric current that the profits piled up mountain high.

Aluminum paint is an effective means of reducing the amount of heat transmitted through a thin material.

I suffered blinding sick headaches and fainting spells, and our little girl was weakly. After reading the first letter by Dr. Betts we began to experiment by setting aside our aluminum for a couple of weeks, at which time so much improvement was shown that we loaded all our aluminum into the junk barrel in the alley.

Tomatoes, applesauce and other such acid foods will remove the discoloration and thus give the family the benefit of these minerals.” Julia recommends aluminum, of course, and says there is nothing in all this “propaganda” about aluminum’s being harmful. But those who have discovered the poisonous effect of aluminum by personal experience will know that Julia is just talking through her hat, even though she is an “expert”. Anyway, who wants to eat the dirty deposit of stale food remnants that line an aluminum cooking utensil, and incidentally get a good dose of metal along with it when cooking acid foods in the utensil?

<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Miracles of God—Nowadays?</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;&lt;TXTHERE be all his miracles which our W fathers told us of?” (Judges 6:13) That question, by the valorous Gideon thousands of years ago, is a good one today. If Jehovah, the God of Gideon, performed miracles in ancient times, long before our modern age, then why does He not do miracles today that we moderns may see? But doesn’t He? Of himself Jehovah says: “I am the Lord, I change not” (Malachi 3:6); and of His wonderful Son it is said: “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.”—Hebrews 13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the older part of the Bible, written in Hebrew, the word “miracle” is at different places translated from three Hebrew words respectively; one has the thought of “conspicuousness”, this resulting in the “miracle’s” being outstanding or a marker, a sign; the other word has the sense of “appearing”, as though the miracle shows up and serves as evidence of a certain great truth or fact; the third word means “to separate, to distinguish”, showing that the miracle is extraordinary, distinguished from the usual or likely, and hence great, difficult of being performed by ordinary means, and wonderful. Hence these same Hebrew words are also translated as “sign; wonder”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the second section of the Bible, written in Greek, the word “miracle” is translated from two Greek words, the one meaning simply “power” or “force”, indicating that the miraculous thing is by power and force beyond human; and the other meaning simply “sign”, proving that the miracle is evidence in support of a certain point in controversy. In English the word “miracle” is derived merely from the Latin word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">miraculum,</span><span class="font7"> meaning “wonderful thing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unbelieving and godless crowd insist that they do not today see with their eyes what they understand as a miracle (like those recorded in the Bible) and which they cannot explain by their scientific theories. However, that is no proof (as they claim it is) that there is no God. Bather it is a proof that the methods of Jehovah God are different today, and that these scoffers are blinded by the Devil so that they cannot see or discern and believe what miracles Jehovah has actually been performing now for some time before their natural eyes. Very soon, though, at the battle of Armageddon, Jehovah God will perform numerous of the old-time miracles so that they will see them (and also feel them keenly), and then they will not like it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">50?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">and will wish they hadn’t, that is, hadn’t required such miraculous performance by Jehovah in order to be convinced that He is Almighty God. For such very purpose Jehovah will at His own chosen hour do miracles at Armageddon, and the result will be what He has purposed: “The heathen shall know that I am the Lord [Jehovah], the Holy One in Israel.”— Ezekiel 39: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Listen to this about Jehovah’s &quot;strange act” at Armageddon: it is at the time of the final assault by Satan’s visible and invisible forces upon God’s organization, symbolized by Jerusalem the holy city and also now represented on earth by God’s truly devoted ones, Jehovah’s witnesses (Zechariah 14:3,12-15): “Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought [of old] in the day of battle. And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. . . . And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another prophetic war correspondent’s description of the same fight by Jehovah and against all of Satan’s forces going into action under the Devil’s subordinate officer, Gog (Ezekiel 38:18-23): “And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel [spiritual Israel today], . . . Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall [of defense] shall fall to the ground. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against his brother. And I will plead against him with pestilence and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him [Gog], an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.” All this will be more wonderful than poison gas, machine-gun fire, aircraft bombs, liquid fire, death rays, deadly-germ dispersers, incendiary bombs, and all the shot and shell sent forth by devilish human war machines; hence it will be miraculous. It is beyond human power and device, and it will be for a sign!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Miracle Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miracles from Jehovah God are performed by His power and in order to carry forward His work. They are a sign-proof that Jehovah is God and is almighty and supreme, and are a vindication of His word and name. When performed by and through His faithful servants, such miracles are proof that they are the true representatives of God and that His message through them is the only truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil and his servants are also able to work miracles, and by such works many are misled and become the dupes of the Devil. Merely that a work is unusual, superhuman, or miraculous is no proof of itself that it is a work of the true God, nor that the workers thereof are God’s servants and His teachers and leaders for the people to guide them in the right way that leads to life and truth and all blessings. The deceived Samaritans thought that Simon Magus of their day was “the great power of God”; but Simon used sorcery, and his bewitching works were not by God’s holy spirit or power. (Acts 8:9-24) And he could not duplicate the works of Christ’s true disciples and apostles. Concerning our own day Jesus predicted: “There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders [miracles]; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.” (Matthew 24:24,25) Some of these very miracle-workers would themselves be deceived into thinking that they represent the Lord and that they should deserve recognition of Him and receive His reward; Jesus said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity [hence the work of the Devil].” (Matthew 7: 21-23) Of that base, traitorous, hypocritical, Judas-like class today, which the Scriptures call “that man of sin”, “the son of perdition [destruction],” it is foretold that his 'coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all manner of unrighteousness’. —2 Thessalonians 2: 3, 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miracles do not in themselves prove the worker and his message to be from the true God. What further test, then, must be applied in addition to that of working miracles? This: Does the force of his miracles and teaching tend to turn one to Jehovah God and His holy Word and service ? If not, then the miracle-worker is a fraud, a false prophet, and his miracles are by Satan’s power: “If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; [what to do?] thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lobd [Jehovah] your God with all your heart and with all your soul.” —Deuteronomy 13:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A true proclaimer or publisher of God’s Word does not require miracles to prove his mission as from God and his message as the truth. John the baptizer was a true prophet. “There was a man sent from God, whose name was John,” and his birth was by a miracle. (John 1:6; Luke 1:5-24) Jesus declared there had been no prophet greater than John, and yet the record is that “John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man [Jesus] were true”.— John 10:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the message of any servant of God is in harmony with and in fulfillment of the inspired and written Word of God, then his message is the truth, even if miracles be lacking in connection therewith. “To the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them”; “Thy word is truth.” (Isaiah 8:20; John 17:17) But if the message-bearer also perform miracles, then such is a proof that confirms that God sent him. Moses was given miraculous signs to perform before his brethren in Egypt to prove that Jehovah had sent him and was back of him. (Exodus 4:1-9) When sending Moses in before the stubborn, unbelieving Pharaoh, Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron his brother: “When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.” (Exodus 7:9) Then Moses and Aaron went in and did so, and in due course there followed upon Pharaoh and all Egypt the ten terrific plagues, culminating in that miraculous deliverance of the pursued Israelites from the Red sea and the overwhelming and drowning of the pursuing army and chariots of Pharaoh. These miracles of God the Scriptures repeatedly refer to as “signs and wonders” executed in the land of Egypt, the land of Ham, and these are what Gideon meant when he said to Jehovah’s angel (Judges 6:13): “Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?”—Numbers 14:22; Deuteronomy 11:3; Jeremiah 32: 20, 21; Psalm 106: 7, 22; Acts 7: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ human birth was a miracle, a sign vindicating God’s word. (Isaiah 7:11,14; Matthew 1:22,23) Jesus’ teaching was the truth, regardless of or even without miracles to accompany, because His doctrine was not His own but that of His Father which sent Him. But it was recognized, even by Pharisees, that Jesus was a “teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him”. (John 3:2) His marvelous works proved Him to be the Christ of God. Of Him the apostle Peter said to the Jews: “Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know.” (Acts 2: 22) The power to perform miracles was passed on by Jesus to His apostles and was evidence of their apostleship. Writes Paul: “Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.” (2 Corinthians 12:12) “For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the spirit of God.” (Romans 15:18,19) “Great salvation ... at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy [spirit].” —Hebrews 2: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The miracles performed by His disciples and in the name of Jesus bore undeniable evidence that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font7"> was the name of the Christ, Jehovah’s only-begotten Son and the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and the only One through whom Jehovah gives life to man and deliverance from bondage to Satan’s organization. (Acts 4:10, 30; 3: 6,16) Those who need miracles and are attracted only by miracles do not have the love of the truth. To illustrate: After the miracle of feeding five thousand, “then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.” But when these men hunted Jesus up again, “Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.” Then, in proof that Jesus’ unminced words to them were correct, “they said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work? Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.” (John 6:14, 26-31) Correctly did the apostle write: “For the Jews require a sign” (1 Corinthians 1: 22); not that they might thereby be led to believe, but that, if possible, they might put God’s servant in a hard position, that they could have more excuse not to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such miracles are not necessary today. Why not? Because the Bible record of God’s word and works is now complete and is sufficient for all who are feeling after God and who would come to Him. (2 Timothy 3:16,17) Moreover, “Christendom” claims to be a believer in God and His Word. Miracles are “signs”; like the gift of tongues, they are “for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not”. (1 Corinthians 14: 22) Hence if “Christendom” still requires a sign, it shows that she is “evil and adulterous”; because, Jesus said, “an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To one is given, by the spirit, the word of wisdom; ... to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; . . . Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret”? (1 Corinthians 12:8-10,29,30) To those questions the Word of God answers, No. And among those to whom the “working of miracles” was not and is not given are those who are God’s true representatives and messengers today, Jehovah’s witnesses. “Working of miracles” ceased with the death of the faithful apostles and their fellow disciples to whom such power was given, because the true church was now established, “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.” (Ephesians 2: 20) In His prophecy on conditions at the end of the world or age Jesus warned His true followers against the coming of miracle-workers and their “signs and wonders” so deceptive. (Matthew 24:24) “Working of miracles” by God’s servants may now have ceased, “but charity [love; of God] never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail [and they now have ceased to be granted]; whether there be tongues, they shall cease [and they have ceased]; whether there be [the gift of] knowledge, it shall vanish away [and it has vanished].”—1 Corinthians 13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Modern-Day Miracles</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Aside, then, from the miracle of victory and vindication which Jehovah will work by Christ Jesus at the battle of Armageddon, is God working any miracles today and now among the peoples of earth? The Bible prophecies answer, Yes, and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies bears out that affirmative answer. ‘Indeed?’ you say, ‘and, pray, where are they? and what?’ Jesus said: “An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign” (Matthew 12: 38, 39); but here’s trusting that you are not of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ birth was a miracle nineteen centuries ago; but a far greater and grander miracle today is the birth of Jehovah’s “man child”; not Christ Jesus, but Jehovah’s kingdom pictured by the “man child” and in which Jesus is the anointed King and His faithful followers are to be associated with Him in vindicating Jehovah’s name. This occurred in A.D. 1914. The World War and attending disasters prove it. Prophecy thus fulfilled proves it. (Matthew 24: 3-16) That miraculous birth was by God’s organization (His “woman”), and in spite of the fact that Satan’s mighty organization (the “great red dragon”) opposed the Kingdom and threatened to devour it should it be born. (Revelation 12:1-5,10) These two great organizations, God’s and Satan’s, have now been revealed to those looking heavenward for deliverance; and these organizations revealed constitute each respectively a “sign”, “a wonder” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Revised Version); </span><span class="font7">and the revelation of God’s organization under Christ and as opposed by Satan’s organization is the “sign of the Son of man, in heaven”.— Matthew 24:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preaching of this gospel, the gospel of this Kingdom as now established and operating, is another miracle, in progress since the close of the World War, as Jesus predicted. “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) This gospel preaching is being done by Jehovah God through the tiny band of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth. Like Isaiah and his sons (Isaiah 8:18; Hebrews 2:13), and like Ezekiel (12:6, 11; 24:24,27), and also like the high priest Joshua (Zechariah 3:8, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font7"> so Jehovah’s witnesses today are “for signs and wonders”, in “Christendom” and even in heathendom. From house to house and from village and city to village and city they go, bearing the Kingdom tidings, everywhere. By word of mouth they preach, also by hundreds of millions of copies of the message in printed form, by mobile sound trucks, and sound boats, by portable transcription sound machines, by portable phonographs, and by radio transmitters in many lands and by great networks of radio stations, including short-wave stations on whose beams the Kingdom message is borne to all parts of the habitable world for reception. Thus in a few short years the glorious good news of God’s government established has been preached to millions far, far outnumbering all those to whom Jesus and His miracle-working disciples preached in all their lifetime. And all this in the face of cruel persecution and continually rising world-wide opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses and His message by them. Hence “this is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes”. (Psalm 118: 23) It is Jehovah’s moderntime miracle, open and apparent to all “Christendom”. But does “Christendom” regard the miracle? Only to get furiously angry thereat and to try to prevent or undo it by destroying Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus the miraculous plagues with which Jehovah smote Egypt at the hand of Moses and Aaron do now find their miraculous counterpart in the message of divine judgment and vengeance which Jehovah’s witnesses pour out today upon “Christendom” and which plagues “Christendom” so and causes her to howl loud in protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And here Jehovah works another modem miracle! As He long ago foretold, at Isaiah 29:13,14: “Forasmuch as this people [‘Christendom’] draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men [clergymen] ; therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for [note now the miracle] the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” No wonder they can’t discern Jehovah’s modern miracles and His way of bringing life, peace and prosperity to mankind! But at Armageddon they shall be made to know that Jehovah is God and He only is wise and rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But do </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font7"> see and believe God’s miracles, “signs and wonders” and marvelous doings of today? Or do you still require a miracle, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">“sign” ? “Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and PERISH: for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man [Jehovah’s witness] declare it unto you.”—Acts 13:40,41.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">UDGE RUTHERFORD again sets forth in his clear, cogent manner the Bible prophecies and their fulfillment, proving without question, in the booklet UNIVERSAL WAR NEAR, that war is near. The opening chapter starts with this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Great events have heretofore come to pass and which involved many nations. In the very near future a far greater event will come to pass and which will involve the entire universe. The war of 1914 was the greatest war up to that time. The universal war that is near will be far more stupendous, for only a few persons, comparatively, will survive.”</span></p>

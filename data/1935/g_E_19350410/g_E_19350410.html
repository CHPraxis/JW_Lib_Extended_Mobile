<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Building of Solomon’s Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS a simple matter, now, to ascertain the exact date when the construction of Solomon’s temple was begun. The new moon nearest the vernal equinox rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10: 55 N., Lightday, Edenic day No. 1093164, B.R. 1067, vernal equinoxN0.2993</span><span class="font7"> (4:55 a.m., Sunday, March 16, 1035 B.C.). This was the counterpart of No. 73590 in the Lunation Experience Table. Making use of the eclipse cycles to promote greater accuracy, the next new moon rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4:39 N., Earthday, Edenic day No. 1093193 </span><span class="font7">(10:39 p.m., Monday, April 14). The moon was not seen that night: hence the second month did not begin until 45 hours later, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Life 1, Edenic day No. 1093195, God's month No. 37019, vernal equinox No. 2993</span><span class="font7"> (6:00 pm, Wednesday, April 16, 1035 B.C.). The second day of the month was 24 hours later; the work of building the temple would hardly have been begun after sundown; therefore, the work on the temple was begun </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Life 2, 1067 B.R.</span><span class="font7"> (sometime Friday morning or afternoon, April 18, 1035 B.C.). Probably all that was done that day was to lay the corner stone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ESSENTIALS OF JEHOVAH’S MEMORIAL CALENDAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ACH year has 365 or 366 days, from one vernal equinox to another, governed by the sun. Each year ends with the end, about sundown, of that day in which the vernal equinox occurs at Jerusalem; the old year’s ending at that point marks the time of the beginning of the new.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark22">1</a></sup> The years are numbered, backward or forward, from the Ransom of mankind, by the death of Jesus, at Jerusalem, which by that act became the time center of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Each month has 29 or 30 days, governed by the moon (at Jerusalem). The 14th day of each month Is that day, beginning about sundown, In which the moon becomes full over Jerusalem. The months of God (His moons) are numbered from the creation of Adam In Eden; they are named after the works of God, His doings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Each day has 24 hours, 12 of night followed by 12 of day, of equal length at equinox, governed by the sun. The day begins, about sundown, at that point which Is midway between noon and midnight. The total days of human history (Edenic days) are numbered from the creation of Adam, In Eden. They are named after the works of God, His doings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The date of this Issue (No. 406) of The Golden Age Is Starday, Redemption 6, Edenic day No. 2177593, God’s month No. 73740, Jehovah’s Year of Ransom 1903.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of [Jehovah] laid, in the month Zif [name of heathen origin]: and in the eleventh year, in the month Bui [name of heathen origin], which is the eighth month, was the house fin-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is wished to locate the days of dedication of the temple, and as it is desirable to be as exact as possible, recourse is again had to the eclipse cycles. No. 37105, nearest the vernal equinox of 1028 B.C., is the counterpart of No. 73677, Friday, February 28, 1930, 3: 58 p.m., from which it is removed by 164 eclipse cycles of 223 moons each. Table for the first eight months follows (overleaf).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The point of special interest is moon No. 37111; a correction of one hour and 29 minutes over the “mean” lunation was obtained by using the eclipse cycles. In this month the temple was dedicated, before it was quite completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dedication of the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dedication of the temple was forecast in the following instructions to Moses: “The fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah ...

<p><span class="font7">have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest . . . And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days. . . . It is a statute for ever throughout your generations.”—Leviticus 23: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Allowing for the usual time for observation and proclamation, the eighth day of the seventh month began at sundown </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, King 8, Edenic day No. 109'5920,</span><span class="font7"> which day began Thursday evening, September 30, and continued until sundown of October 1 (vernal equinox No. 3000). On that day began the dedication of the altar, lasting for seven days. The day of atonement fell on the tenth day of the same month; very appropriately the dedication of the altar began two days before. The figures are all unusually interesting. The Edenic day itself ushered in week No. 156560. This is a noteworthy number, being composed of 2x2x2x2x5x19 x 103. Falling on October 1 of the year of creation No. 3000, and at the time of the beginning of the dedication of the altar of Solomon’s temple, this number probably has some significance that sometime will be understood. The record of the dedication itself is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim [the name is of heathen origin], which is the seventh month. And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, . . . There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.” (1 Kings 8:2,3,9-11, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font7">“And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast [of tabernacles] seven days. And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.”—2 Chronicles 7: 9,10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Another Astounding Confirmation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another astounding confirmation of the accuracy of God’s “faithful witness in the heavens” now appears. While, according to Holy Writ (Leviticus 23:33-39), the feast of tabernacles (which began on the 15th of this month, and lasted seven days) could have begun on any day of the w’eek and ended on any day of the week, and both of the days would properly have been counted as special sabbaths unto Jehovah God, yet what if infinite Wisdom had so arranged it that on this most extraordinary occasion these fifteen days ended in such a way as to coincide exactly with the regular weekly sabbath arrangement? That is just what took place, for the ‘twenty-third day<sup>5</sup> above specified was a weekly sabbath. The account is interesting at this point; for instead of saying that Solomon sent the people home, it says that he sent them to their tents. They remained in their tents another night, starting for home the next morning, on the first day of the week, as was meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dedication of the altar for seven days, followed by the feast of tabernacles for seven days, and dismissal of the people on the next succeeding day, is set out in the following table:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">How did it happen that Solomon, after the required time had elapsed for dedication of the altar and the temple, sent the people away a day later “glad and merry in heart” as God’s true people are as they read this account ? The table answers. The next day was a sabbath day of rest and worship. For, be it known, this record was written for Jehovah’s people that are living now. Not until now were these particular 'precious things of the moons’ “thrust forth” by the power of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The student who reads the accounts in 1 Kings 8 and 2 Chronicles 7 will note that not all the details of the temple furnishings, etc., were completed until a few days after the dedication services had ended. The exact time when the last vessel was made ready is not stated; it is merely mentioned that it was in the next month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is so in the antitype. The dedication of the spiritual temple of God and its “altar” of the sacrifice of praise to Jehovah has been in full swing for years; since 1918. When the work will all be finished is not known. Probably the end is near, but it does not matter whether it is or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cleansing the Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next days in the Scripture record that can be definitely located are those identified with cleansing the temple in the first year of the reign of the good king Hezekiah. His reign began in the year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">777 B.R.</span><span class="font7"> (745 B.C.). Hezekiah was the good son of a bad man, Ahaz, in whose days the worship in the temple was neglected and idolatry was practiced. The temple had become so filled with refuse of all sorts that it took 14 men 16 days to clean it, a total of 224 days’ work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After listing the workers the account says: “Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify [clear away the rubbish], and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.”—2 Chronicles 29:17, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cleansing work was not finished in time for the passover to be held at the regular time (fourteenth day of first month), so, in accordance with the law, made elastic to take care of just such an emergency (Numbers 9:10,11), arrangements were made “to keep the passover in the second month” (2 Chronicles 30:2) and messengers were dispatched to every part of Palestine to have as large and representative a gathering as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread [beginning the next day after the passover] seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, singing with loud instruments unto Jehovah. And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers. And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness. For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven. Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Ma-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">nasseh, until they had destroyed them all.”— 2 Chronicles 30:20-27; 31:1, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Locating the Days of Hezekiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the spring of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">777 B.R.</span><span class="font7"> (745 B.C.) to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Y.R. 1903</span><span class="font7"> (1935 A.D.) there are 2,679 years. There are 12.3682 lunations per year: total for the period, 33,135 moons. In 33,135 moons there are 148 eclipse cycles of 223 moons each, and 131 over. Back 131 moons from No. 73740 (down at this end) was the corresponding moon No. 73609. Now, 33,135 moons minus 131 are 33,004, the number of moons it is desired to go back from No. 73609, to locate the lunation nearest to the spring equinox in the year of Hezekiah above mentioned. Moon No. 73609 rose, astronomically, Jerusalem time, at 11:02 a.m., Saturday, August 30, 1924 A.D. In 33,004 moons are 33004 x 2551442.864976 seconds, which are 84,207,820,315.667904 seconds. Dividing in the usual way, first by 604800 (seconds in a week), then by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">86400</span><span class="font7"> (seconds in a day), then by 3600 (seconds in an hour), and finally by 60 (seconds in a minute), this length of time equals 139232 weeks 3 days 13 hours 12 minutes. These 3 days 13 hours 12 minutes back from 11:02 a.m., Saturday, August 30, take one to a Tuesday at 9:50 p.m. Now it is desired to go back 139,232 weeks (which are 974,624 days) from 9: 50 p.m., Tuesday, August 26, 1924 A.D. From 745 B.C. to 1924 A.D. there are 2,668 years. These years contain 2668 x 365 days (973,820), 26x24 leap days in the 26 unbroken centuries (624), 6 leap days in the present century, 11 in the eighth century B.C., and 6 quad-ricentesimal leap days: total days in 2668 years, 974,467. The desired day is 974624-974467, which is 157, days back from (before) August 26. The answer is that in the first year of Hezekiah’s reign the new moon rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3: 50 N., Starday, Edenic day No. 1199091, God's month No. 40605, B.R. 777</span><span class="font7"> (9:50 p.m., Tuesday, March 22, 745 B.C.). In the year 1935 A.D., March 22 comes on a Friday. Reference to the six-thousand-year calendar (page 368 of No. 404) shows that in the year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">777 B.R.</span><span class="font7"> (745 B.C.) the date named would have fallen on a Tuesday; which shows that the answer is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very well. The first month was ushered in about 44 hours subsequently. Cleaning up the temple, therefore, began on the morning of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mans day, Redemption 1, Edenic day No. 1199093, B.R. 777</span><span class="font7"> (Friday, March 25, 745 B.C.). This was a work that could properly be pushed on any day of the week. The account says that on the eighth day, which was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Edenic day No. 1199100<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark23">2</a></sup></span><span class="font7"> (Friday, April 1), ushering in week No. 171300, they came to the porch of Jehovah, and on the sixteenth of the month, which was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Edenic day No. 1199108 </span><span class="font7">(Saturday, April 9), they made an end of the cleansing work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Referring to moon No. 73609 (counterpart, in 1924 A.D., of moon No. 40606 in Hezekiah’s day), the time intervening to the next lunation was 29 days 699 minutes (29 days 11 hours 39 minutes): it therefore occurred </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3:29 D., Lifeday, Edenic day No. 1199120</span><span class="font7"> (9: 29 a.m., Thursday, April 21). Another glance at the Lunation Experience Table, moon No. 73610, shows that the time intervening to the next succeeding lunation was 29 days 641 minutes, half of which is 14 days 17 hours 2014 minutes. Therefore, the full of the moon in the second month was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">8:49 N., Mansday, Life 13, Edenic day No. 1199135 </span><span class="font7">(ushering in week No. 171305), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B.R. 777</span><span class="font7"> (2:49 a.m., Friday, May 6, 745 B.C.). Depending upon visibility, it would have been possible to hold this passover on a Thursday night, and it may have been so held, but the account rather suggests that it was held sometime after sundown, next thereafter, on the sabbath which had then begun. The seven days’ feast of unleavened bread began, according to the law, on the 15th of the month, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Life 15, Edenic day No. 1199137</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, May 8), and they necessarily ended on a second sabbath; and all received such a blessing from Jehovah God that they remained over for yet another week. Their convention, therefore, like that at the dedication of the temple, seems to have lasted over three sabbaths; it ended on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Life 28, Edenic day No. 1199150</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, May 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Calendar Does God Use?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This item about Hezekiah is set out in some considerable detail, together with the calculations, because it provides yet one more surprising proof of the manner in which Jehovah God caused His 'faithful witness in the heavens’ to bear record of the reliability of His Word. If the Devil, or any of his theologians, had had anything to do with the movement of the moon through the heavens, no such record would now be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.” So says one faithful witness of Jehovah. (Romans 1:20) “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.” (Psalm 19: 1-4) Who can doubt the precision, the exactitude, the wisdom, of the great Creator? The daytime, the nighttime; summer and winter; seedtime and harvest; year in, year out, follow one another with unfailing regularity. Is it not reasonable to believe that the great Jehovah would give to His human creatures some reliable measuring “line” so their relationship to time could be reliably recorded? Jesus told His disciples the day and the hour of His second coming was known only to His Father. (Matthew 24:36) If the Father kept record with such exactness, what calendar did He use? Would He be party to the caprice of the worshipers of heathen gods and recognize the days and months named after these gods, or would He have the heavens show forth His handiwork? Would their line (measuring cord) go out throughout the earth? Is it not reasonable to believe that, with the time having come for the knowledge of Jehovah to cover the earth, His method of recording the times and seasons would be made known to His people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Josiah’s Great Passover</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next day definitely marked in the Scriptures is the great passover of King Josiah, at which time Josiah destroyed idolatry out of Judah. The reader should read the 22d and 23d chapters of 2 Kings and note the very considerable attention given to this subject in Holy Writ. On account of its connection with the feast of Jeroboam it would seem that this is about to have its fulfillment, in antitype, in “Christendom”. After describing in detail the thorough cleansing work carried on under Josiah’s direction (similar to that which Jehovah God is now carrying on in the earth) the account terminates:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem. And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God [Exodus 12:22,23], as it is written in this book of the covenant. Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem. . . . And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.” —2 Kings 23: 20-23, 25, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will now be of great interest to see on just what day this passover occurred. The new moon at that season rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">12:19 N., Lifeday, Edenic day No. 1237067</span><span class="font7"> (6:19 p.m., Wednesday, March 13, 641 B.C.). The month began 48 hours thereafter (Friday evening, March 15, 641 B.C.), and its fourteenth day was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mans day, Redemption 14, Edenic day No. 1237082, B.R. 673,</span><span class="font7"> beginning at sundown Thursday, March 28, 641 B.C. Surely there could be no hour more appropriate to commemorate the passover than the same hour and the same day of the week in which the Lord himself last observed it, and at which time He instituted the new thing, the memorial of His death in vindication of Jehovah’s name. How does it happen that in every one of these instances it turns out that the moon was such a true and faithful witness? It does not happen. It was arranged. There is an appropriateness about all these designations of particular days that cannot fail to impress every person who loves God. Jehovah God knew centuries in advance what would be the day of the week, as well as the day of the month, when His first and best loved son would die a ransom for many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Times of the Gentiles (Luke 21:24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The seven (Gentile) times ended with the placing of earth’s rightful king upon His throne, approximately </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, King 10, Edenic day No. 2170097, Y.R. 1882</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, October 1, 1914). If they had begun exactly 2,520 years previously they would have begun October 1, 607 B.C. But the World War did not begin exactly on time. “The nations were angry” (Revelation 11:18), so angry that they could not wait until the Devil’s lease had expired; therefore the war began some nine weeks ahead of time. An approximate date is the best that can be expected on this item.* The date 588 B.C. in Oxford Bibles is nineteen years out of the way; the proper date for the following passage is 607 B.C., hitherto generally spoken of as being the beginning of the year 606 B.C. (However, the assumption that the true beginning of the year is in the fall is erroneous. The items are properly placed in 607 B.C., and nicely show the anger of the nations ahead of time, 2,520 years subsequently, as the times of the Gentiles were drawing to a close.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city. . . . And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month . . . came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: and he burnt the house of [Jehovah], and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with fire. But it came to pass, in the seventh month, that Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.” (2 Kings 25: 2, 3, 8, 9, 25, 26) There the seventy years desolation of Judah and Jerusalem began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the year 607 B.C. the new moon nearest the spring equinox rose </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9:23 N., Lifeday, Edenic day No. 1249499, God’s month No. 42312, vernal equinox No. 3421</span><span class="font7"> (3:23 a.m., Thursday, March 27). The day when the famine is noted as having been severe, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Freedom 9, Edenic day No. 1249598%</span><span class="font7"> (Friday, July 4), is interesting, as it was about this time (in 1914,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•“But, as above observed, the proof shows that the three and one-half times of Daniel began at the ‘time of the end’, to wit, October 1, 1914. At that time there were on the earth a number of persons consecrated to God and wholly devoted to his cause. They had entirely separated themselves from and broken off all alliance with worldly organizations. They were putting forth their best endeavors to preach the truth of God’s kingdom. The Scriptures and the facts then, and those which follow, show that this class exactly fits the prophet’s description of ‘the holy people’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Just exactly [f] three and one-half literal years, or 1260 days, by Biblical method of calculation, after the time of the end, there began, to wit, 1918, a great persecution of these holy people of God. Early in February, 1918, many of ‘the holy people’, or God’s anointed, in Canada were arrested and thrown into prison. In the same month the books of account and private papers of the Society’s office at Brooklyn headquarters were seized. A few days later the officers of the Society at Brooklyn were arrested. They were indicted at the instance of Satan’s representatives and were tried, convicted, and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, and were, on the 20th day of June, 1918, confined in prison. At the same time many others of like precious faith and devotion to God, and in different parts of the earth, were arrested and imprisoned. The main office of the Society was completely dismantled, all communication between the main office and branch offices was cut off, and the work of giving the witness to the truth throughout the earth virtually and effectually stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was at this climax of the experiences of the church ‘when he [Satan the enemy, by and through his agencies] accomplished [that is to say, completed and finished] the work of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">scattering</span><span class="font6"> the power of God’s holy people’. This work was the wicked expression of Satan, who had been expelled from heaven and who was -wroth with God’s holy people.—Revelation 12:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As many of the numerals in Revelation appear to be literal, even so the same appears to be true in the prophecy of Daniel. According to Biblical method of calculation of time, a year of 360 days is ‘a time’. Therefore, ‘a time, times, and an half,’ or three and one-half times, is equivalent to 1260 days, or three and one-half literal years. The beginning of this period, which must be at ‘the time of the end’, to wit, October 1, 1914, would necessarily end in the spring of 1918. [f ] The Scriptural statement and the physical facts as they are well known to exist are therefore exactly in harmony and show that 1260 days are literal in time and began October 1, 1914, and ended practically the first of April, 1918.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> 1929, page 372.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">t Beginning </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">exactly</span><span class="font5"> October 1, 1914, and ending </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">exactly </span><span class="font5">1,260 literal days thereafter, brings to March 14, 1918, the day when the United States government joined with the British government of Canada in banning certain publications of tlie Watch Tower Society. The storm raged around Christian literature (now no longer in print), extending, in some instances, even to Bibles and hymn books, and was the end, for that time, of religious freedom in America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">2,520 years later) that this war to give the liberty-loving peoples of the West a larger and better share of the “new freedom” was first seen as inevitable. The war turned out to be a famine for freedom, not a feast. Canada's Independence Day is a day earlier than that of the United States. Both countries were conspicuous in their advocacy of and participation in the war to make the world safe for democracies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day when Jerusalem was destroyed, including the temple, was the seventh day of the fifth month, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Vindication 7, Edenic day No. 1249625<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">3</a></sup> B.R. 639</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, July 31, 607 B.C.), generally regarded as about the day, in 1914, when the World War broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day in the seventh month when the flight of the Israelites (under Johanan) into Egypt took place is not named. In the year 1914 the seventh month began with moon No. 73486, rising, Jerusalem time, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6: 02 N., Lightday</span><span class="font7"> (12: 02 a.m., Sunday, September 20). Allowing for visibility and proclamation the month began at sundown Monday evening, September 21, and its tenth day (ten is symbolic of completeness with respect to things earthly) was, as would be expected, exactly October 1, when the world was provided with its new ruler, Christ Jesus, who will destroy every vestige of Satan’s empire. (See page 432, fl2-4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is really astounding, the way in which all those dates, back there, 2520 years before 1914, were timed -with such accuracy and such appropriateness to their fulfillments. Only the hand of God could have so arranged. These things particularly, that is, the “times and seasons”, He put entirely in His own power, not taking anybody into His confidence, but leaving the record in the moons so that all may now read it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘The New Moons ... by Number”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers have noticed that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">has numbered the moons from creation forward: this makes an excellent method of identification, good for the purposes of history. There seems to be a possible hint that this course would be proper in God’s sight, in 1 Chronicles 23: 31, which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Offer all burnt sacrifices unto [Jehovah], in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before [Jehovah].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Solomon had determined to build the temple, he wrote to Huram, Idng of Tyre, saying, in part: “Behold, I am about to build </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is an ordinance for ever </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Israel.”—2 Chronicles 2:4, A.jR.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">End of Seventy Years of Desolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It hardly seems necessary to say that the seventy years of desolation ended seventy years from the time they began. As they began in the year 607 B.C., they ended in the autumn of 537 B.C., at the time which w<sup>T</sup>as formerly (incorrectly) called the beginning of the year 536 B.C. Only one event in 537 B.C. claims attention, i.e., that “from the first day of the seventh month” burnt offerings were made to Jehovah at Jerusalem by the restored remnant. (Ezra 3:6) In the year 537 the new moon nearest the spring equinox </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(No. 43178)</span><span class="font7"> rose, astronomically, at 3:09 p.m., Saturday, April 3. The seventh moon of that year, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No. 43184,</span><span class="font7"> rose at 7: 33 p.m., Monday, September 27. The first day of the seventh month </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Lifeday, King 1, 569 B.R.) </span><span class="font7">began at sundown Wednesday, 47 hours thereafter, and ended at sundown Thursday, September 30. This may be taken as a hint from Jehovah God that the legal end of the desolating rule of Satan was the last day of his month of September, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The movements of Ezra can be traced “in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king” (Ezra 7:7), now known to have been the year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">500 B.R. </span><span class="font7">(468 B.C.). “For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.” (Ezra 7:9) The new moon nearest the spring equinox that year rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">11:21 N., Starday, Edenic day No. 1300262, God’s month No. 44031</span><span class="font7"> (5: 21 a.m., Wednesday, March 22). The new year, and the first month of the new year, began about 37 hours subsequently, and it can be said with confidence that Ezra began his trip to the contact point at the river Ahava on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Edenic day</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No. 1300264<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark25">4</a></sup></span><span class="font7"> (Friday, March 24), ushering in week No. 185752.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Then we departed from the river of Ahava, on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem.” (Ezra 8:31) The journey proper was begun </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Redemption 12, Edenic day No. 1300275, B.R. 500</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, April 4, 468 B.C.). Ezra arrived at his destination 107 days after leaving Ahava, i.e., reached Jerusalem on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Vindication 1, Edenic day No. 1300382</span><span class="font7"> (probably about the beginning of that day, sundown Wed., July 19).—Ezra 7: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days” (the day of arrival and two subsequent days, including the sabbath). &quot;Now on the fourth day </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Lightday, Vindication 4, Edenic day No. 1300385</span><span class="font7"> (beginning at sundown Saturday, July 22)] was the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites ; by number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto [Jehovah].” (Ezra 8:31-35) Although the account does not stipulate that this great burnt offering of the people was made &quot;upon the first day of the week” (1 Corinthians 16:2), yet the record of God’s “faithful witness in heaven” discloses that it </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font7"> made on that day, and that accounts for the delay on the part of Ezra and his companions for three days so that the offerings could be made at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ezra’s Further Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of Ezra’s tasks was the breaking up of the mixed marriages with the heathen women of the land, entered into by certain Israelites. &quot;It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.” (Ezra 10:9) This conference was called for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Order 20, Edenic day No. 1300520<sup><a href="#bookmark25">4</a></sup> B.R. 500 </span><span class="font7">(Tuesday, December 5, 468 B.C.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter [ten days after the date last named]. And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.” (The session lasted three months, beginning </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Logos 1, Edenic day No. 1300530,</span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">week No. 185790</span><span class="font7"> [Friday, December 15], and ending </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">E a r th d a y, Redemption 1, Edenic day No. 1300618, B.R. 499</span><span class="font7"> [Tuesday, March 13, 467 B.C.].) (Ezra 10:16,17) The chronicle of Ezra, written with references here and there to the days of God’s months, now becomes a diary which can be read with accuracy and therefore with added zest and enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Glimpse at Nehemiah’s Diary</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The last date, prior to the time of Christ, that is “thrust forth by the moons” through the Scriptures is “the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king”. (Nehemiah 2:1) This year, hitherto mentioned as 454 B.C. (by which was meant the beginning of the year 454, on the supposition that the true beginning of the year is in the autumn), is now positively known to be the year 455 B.C. In this article the time of Christ’s death will be exactly shown. That event was midway of a week (of years) before the full end of seventy such weeks (490 years) which ended October 1, A.D. 36. (Daniel 9:2427) From the beginning of the year 455 B.C. to the fall of A.D. 36 is 490^ years, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">y<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font7"> year being ignored as in the case of Jesus, who, when 121^ years of age, is referred to as 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nehemiah was a great organizer and a great ■worker. At the time of his first visit to Jerusalem he had but a brief leave of absence from the court at Shushan, Persia, but managed to get the wall of the city repaired by “the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days”. (Nehemiah 6:15) The name “Elul” is of heathen origin; it refers to the sixth month of the year. The date is located as follows: The new moon nearest the spring equinox rose </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9:33 D., Lifeday, Edenic day No. 1305016, B.R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The factors are 2x2x2x5xl3x 2501.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">t The factors are 2x3x5x7xllx 563.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">487</span><span class="font7"> (3: 33 p.m., Thursday, March 28, 455 B.C.). The date desired is 174 days later, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Starday, Hope 25, Edenic day No. 1305190</span><span class="font7"> (Wednesday, September 18). Nehemiah’s trip one way, in those days, required four months. Now airplanes make it in a few hours, and underneath the way that he traveled runs, almost the whole distance, the largest pipe line in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate: and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which [Jehovah] had commanded to Israel. And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.” (Nehemiah 8:1,2) This was on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, King 1, Edenic day No. 1305196</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, September 24).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Ezra, on the second day of the convention, read to the people, “they found written in the law” (Nehemiah 8:13,14) the arrangement for eight holy days (Leviticus 23:39) to be observed, beginning with the fifteenth of that month, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, King 15, Edenic day No. 1305210</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, October 8). The people at once expressed their desire and intent to wholly obey Jehovah God. The last day of this holy convocation was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, King 22</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, October 15). In the next verse (Nehemiah 9:1) there is an account of what took place on the twenty-fourth day of the month, two days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the days definitely mentioned in the Scriptures, down to the time of Christ, that can be identified by references to the month (God’s months) have now been located and discussed, and a true and perfect chronology has been found with which, in due time, all history will be found to be in accord. Not an item has been found, or could be found, that is out of harmony with God's ‘faithful witness in the heavens’. The ‘precious things thrust forth by the moons’ have been found precious indeed; but most precious of all are the things that are coming next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his host. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the name of Jehovah.” —Psalm 148:1-5, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Month Logo*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the naming of the months in the calendar of Jehovah God, the command of Jehovah seems to properly apply: “Declare his doings among-the people, make mention that his name is exalted.” (Isaiah 12:4) Among all the doings of Jehovah God for humanity, what can compare with His sending of the Logos to be man’s Redeemer ? Appropriately, therefore, this month in which the Logos was sent is named to commemorate that act, and in grateful appreciation, also, of the Logos himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quickly calculating 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes for each lunation from the one nearest the spring equinox, mentioned in the Lunation Table, it appears that the new moon which was to usher in the month </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Logos</span><span class="font7"> rose </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3:56 D., Gods-day, Edenic day No. 1470358, God’s month No. 49791, B.B. 35</span><span class="font7"> (9:56 a.m., Saturday, December 5, 3 B.C.). The new month began at sundown 32 hours later. The nineteenth day of that month </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Logos, Mansday, Edenic day No. 1470378</span><span class="font7"> (December 25), has arrived—day of tremendous importance in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The scene shifts to Nazareth. Elisabeth, wife of Zacharias, cousin of Mary, still in the hill country of Judea, was then in her sixth month, carrying with her her blessing, her gift from Jehovah God. The Logos and Gabriel have received their great commission: nothing like it has ever been done before, or will ever be done again. When that commission, accepted gladly, instantly and unquestioningly, had been given, the Father then and there “sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world”. He did not come of himself: He was sent; but He was glad to come; glad to do </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">anything</span><span class="font7"> that would reflect honor upon His heavenly Father’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He came, the Logos, accompanied by Gabriel, from the courts of heaven to the lowly scenes of earth. Together they located the humble abode of a true and faithful woman, the one to whom they had been sent. It was on the 19th day of God’s month No. 49791; the heathen call it December 25; other heathen call it Christ's mass. The Logos remained invisible; Gabriel alone materialized in human form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gabriel came in and said to Mary, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women”; what followed is a matter of history, recorded in the first chapter of Luke. The evidence now in hand provides proof that it was on that day, and probably within a second from the time Mary said, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word,” that the Logos “made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men”. “Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2</span><span class="font7"> Corinthians 8: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then and there the Logos </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">divested</span><span class="font7"> himself, laid aside the royal livery of heaven and entered into the tiny cell which Jehovah God had prepared for Him. The Father closed the door softly and the Logos slept; and in that cunning chamber in which all humanity were fashioned the One that had made all things, and 'without whom not anything was made that was made’, experienced great changes in His organism; and they went on in Mary’s too, until the early morning, 280 days later, when she held in her arms her own hope of life eternal, and the hope of all the rest of humankind, “hope of earth and joy of heaven,” the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Lord Born October 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The evidence herein seems to clearly prove that the day of Christ’s birth was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">King 3, Edenic day No. 1470658,</span><span class="font7"> completing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">week No. 210094, God’s month No. 49801, B.R. 34</span><span class="font7"> (Oct. 1, B.C. 2). He was born on a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday</span><span class="font7"> (Friday), and died on the same day of the week, which, as will hereinafter be shown, was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Redemption 14, Edenic day No. 1482894,<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark26">5</a></sup></span><span class="font7"> completing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">week No. 211842, God’s month No. 50215, Year of Ransom 1 </span><span class="font7">(Friday, April 1, A.D. 33). The time of His death was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9:00 D.</span><span class="font7"> (“the ninth hour” of the day, 3:00 p.m.). (Mark 15:34-37) This was midway from the beginning of His ministry, about Oct. 1, A.D. 29, to the conversion of Cornelius, about October 1, A.D. 36. Jesus’ ministry began on His thirtieth birthday, when He “began” to be thirty years of age, or, as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font7"> puts it (Luke 3:23), “And he, Jesus, was about thirty years old when he began [his work].” Jesus being </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">33y<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font7"> years old when He died, it is manifest that the season in which He was born was a half year removed from that of the time of His death. Jesus was born at 3:00 a.m., October 1.—Daniel 9: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a nice point in determining the exact number of days that the Lord lived. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font7">was cut off in the midst of the last week (of years) of the seventy weeks determined upon Jerusalem. He therefore lived to be exactly 33y<sub>2</sub> years old, from the moment of His birth to the moment of His death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If it be true that not one sparrow falls to the ground without your heavenly Father’s knowledge, how much more the critical care with which all the details of the great Vindication on Calvary were looked after! The honest-hearted will get a blessing from their confidence in the Lord that so small a matter as this was not overlooked by Jehovah God. He made the sun, and its years, and nothing is too small to escape the notice of the One who marks the sparrow’s fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ninth hour</span><span class="font7"> Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sa-bachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and [expired]. And the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom.”—Mark 15:33-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The accounts of Matthew and Luke also mention the ninth hour (5: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">00 D.,</span><span class="font7"> 3: 00 p.m.).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(a) If the years of Jesus’ life are counted as ordinary calendar years, then He lived 33y&gt; x 365 days (12227.5 days), plus the 9 leap days of B.C. 1 and A.D. 4,8,12,16, 20, 24,28 and 32; total days, 12,236, and 12 hours. In the 12,236 days there are just 1,748 weeks; and by this reckoning Jesus was born on a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday</span><span class="font7"> (Friday) at 3:00 a.m.; in other words, in the early morning of October 1, B.C. 2. This seems the most likely view. Jesus was born into Satan’s world (2 Corinthians 4:4; John 14:30), and lived on earth while the vagaries of the Roman calendar were in use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(b) If the years of Jesus’ life are counted as years of God, i.e., each 365.2422 days in length, then the days of His life were 12235.6137, or almost a day less than in the paragraph above. By the latter calculation He was born at 12:16 a.m. a day later, i.e., </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday), October </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font7"> B.C. 2. Both views are presented, so that the reader may take his choice. But there are reasons down in A.D. 1914 to believe that the view presented in (a) agrees best with the logic of later events.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The next point of special interest is when God’s boy had come to the age of 121/2 years. Meantime “the child went on growing, and waxing strong, becoming filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon it. And his parents used to journey yearly into Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover. And when he became twelve years, and they went up, according to the custom of the feast, and completed the days, and then were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents noticed it not.”—Luke 2:40-43, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Using the eclipse cycles, to locate the temple incident as closely as possible, moon No. 49955 was the counterpart of No. 73593 in the Lunation Experience Table, which please see. And 106 eclipse cycles of 223 moons each take one back to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5:43 N., Godsday, Edenic day No. 1475201, B.R. 21</span><span class="font7"> (11:43 p.m., Friday, March 9, A.D. 12), at which time the new moon rose under which Jesus and His parents went to Jerusalem to the passover and subsequent feast. The new month and new year began 36 hours later. On the 14th day the passover was celebrated in the early hours of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Light day, Redemption 14</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday evening, March 24). The feast of unleavened bread began the next evening, and lasted seven days, ending at sundown (Sunday evening, April 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The three days in which Jesus was left behind were </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Earthday</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Starday, Redemption 22-24, B.R. 21</span><span class="font7"> (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, April 2-4, A.D. 12). No doubt some of the very doctors of the law with whom Jesus talked on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Redemption 22 </span><span class="font7">(Monday, April 2), were rejoicing 21 solar years later, to the very day, that Jesus was then silent in the tomb. At the end of the Millennium they will get a chance to see what they missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Time of Jesus' Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of great interest to readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is it to know the time when Jesus could look up to the One who had sent Him and cry out, in the place of the sinner He came to redeem, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” and shortly thereafter bow His dear head and meekly say, “It is finished.” The readers of this magazine are the first in the world to know this most precious of all the ancient things which Jehovah God has thrust forth through the moons. Recourse is had to the eclipse cycles, to be as exact as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ last days were spent under moon No. 50215, removed by 105 eclipse cycles of 223 moons each from No. 73630, its counterpart, which please see in the Lunation Experience Table and the chart. This moon, No. 50215, rose at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1:22 D., Lifeday, Edenic day No. 1482879 </span><span class="font7">(7:22 a.m., Thursday, March 17, A.D. 33). Reference to the table shows it was 29 daysand 693 minutes to the next in succession, No. 50216, one-half of which amount of time is 14 days 17 hours and 47 minutes. The moon under which Jesus was crucified, therefore, was at its full at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7: 05 N., Mansday, Redemption 14, Edenic day No. 1482894</span><span class="font7"> (1:05 a.m., Friday, April 1, A.D. 33). Fourteen hours later that day Jesus was dead; the battle was fought and won. The Vindicator had done what He came to earth to do, and what He did was in itself a great vindication of Jehovah’s word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Calendar of the Lord’s Last Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jewish feast of the passover, held on the fourteenth of the first month, was thereafter followed by seven days of unleavened bread. These seven days of unleavened bread, in the mind of most Jews, seem to have been the important thing. They occurred on the 15th to the 21st of the month, inclusive. The 14th, the day of Christ’s death, was referred to as “the day of the preparation”. (Matthew 27: 62; Luke 23: 54) See footnote, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott, </span><span class="font7">conunent on Luke 2:43: “Eight days, of which the feast of the Passover was one, and the rest were the seven days of unleavened bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When, therefore, one reads, “Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany,” and “There they made him a supper”, the proper understanding is that He came in the daytime, not of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday,</span><span class="font7"> but of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Redemption 9, Edenic day No. 1482889, Y.R. 1</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, March 27, A.D. 33), and that the supper at which Mary broke upon Him the alabaster box of ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, was in the closing hours of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Redemption 9</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, March 27). John 12:1-11 may now be read with added zest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The story continues (John 12:12) that “on the next day”, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday,</span><span class="font7"> occurred the triumphal entry, which is therefore identified as having taken place in the daylight hours of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Redemption 10, Edenic day No. 1482890</span><span class="font7"> (Monday, March 28). There God’s paschal Lamb was selected for sacrifice. (See John 12:12-15; Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:110; Luke 19: 29-44.) This is the day on which Jesus wept over Jerusalem and declared it should be leveled to the ground. (Luke 19:4144) “And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.”—Mark 11:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And on the morrow, w’hen they were come from Bethany, he was hungry.” (Mark 11:12) It takes considerable food to supply the needs of twelve active men, and apparently rations were short or missing for Jesus and His followers on the morning of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Redemption 11, Edenic day No. 1482891</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, March 29). Some of Jehovah’s people today are familiar with the sensation of hunger which led to Jesus’ prophetic act. (Verse 13) It was on this day that the second cleansing of the temple occurred. “And when even was come, he went out of the city.”—Mark 11:19. (See Luke 19: 45-48; Matthew 21:12-16; Mark 11: 14-18.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And in the morning </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Starday, Redemption 12, Edenic day No. 1482892</span><span class="font7"> (Wednesday, March 30)], as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.” (Matthew 21: 20-22; Mark 11: 20-25) On this day Christ’s authority was challenged by the chief priests and elders (Matthew 21: 23-27; Mark 11: 27-33; Luke 20:1-8); He spoke the parable of the certain man who planted the vineyard (Mark 12: 1-12; Luke 20:9-19); answered the question about the tribute to Caesar (Matthew 22:1540); spoke about the woman who had seven husbands, and which is the greatest commandment (Mark 12:13-34; Luke 20:20-40); asked w’hose son is Christ (Matthew 22:41-46; Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44); gave His condemnation of the clergy (Matthew 23; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 20:45-47); contrasted the ostentatious rich with the poor humble widow who gave her all. (Mark 12: 41-44; Luke 21:1-4) On this day Jesus said His hour was come, and on it the Father spoke to Him audibly from heaven. (John 12:20-36) On this day the Jews turned away from Him, refusing to accept Him (John 12: 37-50); on this day was the great prophecy spoken regarding the end of the world (Matthew 24 and 25; 26:1, 2; Mark 13; Luke 21:538)); and on this day Judas made his bargain with the chief priests. (Matthew 26:1-5,14-16; Mark 14:1,2,10,11; Luke 22:1-6) One can hardly imagine the amount of nervous energy used up in such a strenuous day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Redemption 13, Edenic day No. 1482893</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, March 31), the disciples prepared for the passover, and that night, after sundown, there was the last supper (Matthew 26:17-30; Mark 14:12-26; Luke 22:7-30; John 13:1-30), and Jesus gave His intimate followers His farewell discourses (Matthew 26: 31-35; Mark 14: 27-31; Luke 22: 31-38; John 13 to 16 inclusive) and the last prayer.—John 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On that same day, i.e., </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mans day, Redemption 14, Edenic day No. 1482894, Y.R. 1</span><span class="font7"> (Friday, April 1, A.D. 33), there was the agony in Gethsemane (Matthew 26:30-46; Mark 14:26-42; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1), the betrayal and arrest (Matthew 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22: 47-53; John 18:1-12), the trial before the Jewish authorities (Matthew 26:57 to 27: 10; Mark 14:53-72; Luke 22:54-71; John 18: 12-27), the trial before Pilate (Matthew 27:1131; Mark 15:1-20; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:28 to 19:16), and, of course, the crucifixion and burial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Redemption 15, Edenic day No. 1482895</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, April 2), the priests and the Pharisees had their watch posted at the Savior’s tomb.—Matthew 27: 62-66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Redemption 16, Edenic day No. 1482896</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, April 3), Jesus was raised from the dead (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16: 1-11; Luke 23: 56 to 24:12; John 20:1-18), and the watch reported their unsuccessful efforts to keep Him in the tomb (Matthew 28:11-15); Jesus took the walk to Emmaus with two of His disciples (Mark 16:12,13; Luke 24:13-35), and that night appeared to the disciples, Thomas being absent.—Mark 16:14; Luke 24:36-43; John 20:19-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life and Visitment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Awakened from the sleep of death on the day last above named, Jesus “shewed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days”. (Acts 1:3) Therefore His ascension into heaven took place on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Life 24, Edenic day No. 1482935</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, May 12). Had Jesus not ascended into heaven and there presented the evidence of His perfect work on man’s behalf, God’s gift of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font7"> to fallen man would have been held in abeyance. All hope of life for man rests in the fact that Jesus finished in every respect the work the Father gave Him to do, and tlris included His ascension on high as well as His death. A dead Savior would be a great testimonial of love, but a risen and exalted Savior means </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font7"> to a dead and dying world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ten days later, at Pentecost, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Visitment 6, Edenic day No. 1482945</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, May 22), the holy spirit was poured out upon the little company waiting for it at Jerusalem. The name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Visitment</span><span class="font7"> is applied to this month because of this great event. See in the concordance the many, many times in which God promised to visit His professed people, either for good or for ill. This word may be used in respect to either kind of visit; in this case, how gracious and kind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus, of the thirteen months that may go to make up one of the years of Jehovah God, four, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Redemption, Life, Visitment</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Logos </span><span class="font7">are named after the doings of God at the time of the first advent of the Lord Jesus Christ. The other months are named after His doings in the last threescore years. In the interim little of real consequence occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower—Visitment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The night of darkness that settled down upon the world with the death of the apostles began to be lifted on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Visitment 11, Edenic day No. 2157222, Y.R. 1847</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, July 1, A.D. 1879), by the publication of the first number of the magazine that Jehovah God has used as His mouthpiece from that time to this. Twice every month it has gone to His people in every part of the world, filled to the brim with the truth as it has become due in these last days. What </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtou-er</span><span class="font7"> is, and what it does, can be readily learned by any inquirer who will address The Watch Tower, Brooklyn, N. Y., and request a sample copy. The journal is devoted entirely to the vindication of God’s name. All its studies in the Scriptures are to that end. It should be in the home of every reader of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> and, indeed, of every child of God. The month </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Visitment</span><span class="font7"> is also appropriately named in that in this month the first issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> appeared. Not only are the contents of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> different, and on a far higher plane than of any other journal in the world, but the Lord’s poor have always been able to get it without money and without price, merely by asking for it once a year. Studies in the Divine Word, appearing from issue to issue in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> often find their way, later, into important books on Bible subjects. The readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">get the truths first, and later on the same truths get to the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73630, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Visitment 12, Edenic day No. 2174351, Y.R. 1894 </span><span class="font7">(Tuesday, May 25, A.D. 1926), at London, England, there the 1335 days ended and there began the great era of blessedness spoken of by Daniel the prophet. This blessedness was marked by a testimony to the rulers that Jehovah God has placed His chosen One upon His throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Order—1 Corinthians 14: 40</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Order is heaven’s first law”; and so that the Lord’s work might be prosecuted in an orderly manner in the earth, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was incorporated, on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Order 21, Edenic day No. 2159214, Y.R. 1852 </span><span class="font7">(Saturday, December 13, 1884). Back in the days of Judges, the Bible says of the simple pastoral people that then constituted Jehovah’s people, “every man did that which was right in his own eyes.” But those that then lived in Canaan were not entrusted with a world-wide witness work. Such a course now would be wasteful, disorderly and inefficient in the highest degree. God’s work, to be done properly, requires organization, order, system. (Deuteronomy 12: 8) The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, God’s organization in the earth, is today the most efficient organization beneath the sun. The arrangement is of God. The Society was incorporated by men, true, and men carry on God’s work, the witness feature; but the witnessing is of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Day of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Day of Jehovah”, “That Day,” the “Great Day of God Almighty”, began with His placing His Son upon His throne, and commissioning Him to rule in the midst of His enemies. While the Bible is full of pictures representing that epoch, which reaches from the establishment of the kingdom of God in the earth down to and including Armageddon, yet none seem to represent it better than Moses’ errand to Egypt, so forcefully presented in the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses, in Egypt, delivering the Israelites, humbling Pharaoh and bearing witness to the approaching vindication of God’s name, represents the Lord Jesus, through His organization visible and invisible, doing the same thing, on a colossal scale. The serving of notice on Pharaoh, and the subsequent pouring out of the plagues, engaged Moses and Aaron for 21 days.<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">6</a></sup> Christ Jesus has been reigning in the midst of His enemies 20iZ&gt; years. The antitypical plagues, however, did not begin until after the coming of the Lord to His temple, in the spring of 1918. Everything indicates that Armageddon is very near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be a pleasure, now, for Jehovah’s people to hastily sketch some of the principal items that have gone to make up the Day of Jehovah and to observe how appropriately the names selected for the remaining months of the year agree with the things that Jehovah God, through His Field Marshal, and His organization, has been doing within that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">King</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Throughout the Elijah period of the activities of Jehovah’s organization in the earth, there was repeated insistence of expectation of a great change to take place October 1,1914. How well that expectation was based upon the Scriptures is clearly apparent from comments on pages 423-425 of this issue on “The Times of the Gentiles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is now noted that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">King</span><span class="font7"> came on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mans-day, King 3, Edenic day No. 1470658, B.R. 34 </span><span class="font7">(Friday, October 1, B.C. 2). That was the day that He was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">born.</span><span class="font7"> “Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">born,</span><span class="font7"> and for this cause came I into the world.” (John 18:37) Christ became earth’s righteous ruler 1915 years from the day He was born. In other words, the long anticipated Hope of the World began His reign on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Edenic day No. 2170097</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, October 1, A.D. 1914). It is from that date that the 1260 days of Daniel 12:7 begin to count.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because it is the reign of Christ Jesus that constitutes the Second Presence or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Parousia, </span><span class="font7">it would seem to be not improper to say that the Second Advent occurred on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, King 10<sub>f </sub>Edenic day No. 2170097, Y.R. 1882</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, October 1, A.D. 1914), under moon No. 73486. He came to bring life to man; He came as man’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">King;</span><span class="font7"> He came to perfectly fulfill His office as the appointed Ruler of the earth, as the symbolism of 10 indicates. Ezekiel 21:27 shows that when Jesus comes God gives Him the Kingdom. Before that coming God did not disclose the day or the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73548, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Starday, King 6, Edenic day No. 2171923, Y.R. 1887</span><span class="font7"> (Wednesday, October 1, A.D. 1919), the first issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> was published. It has always been true to the King, earth’s bright and morning Star. Some will notice the “6” and remark that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is not quite perfect yet; yes, but the best possible under the circumstances. Its columns, also, are full of hope for distressed humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73572, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, King 28, Edenic day No. 2172654, Y.R. 1889</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, October 1, A.D. 1921), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> was published. It is a book of God, a book of the King, now in its 6,000,000 edition, in 32 languages. What hope and comfort it has brought to millions can hardly be estimated. In instances, even clergymen have said of this work that it is the most wonderful book they have read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73647, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, King 4, Edenic day No. 2174845, Y.R. 1895</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, October 1, 1927), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> was published, one of the most valuable of aids to a comprehension of God’s purposes; a perfect harmonization of science and the Bible. In instances this work has been used as a textbook in high schools, in the coal regions, as the most scientific and reasonable record in print as to how the coal measures were laid down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Part 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge 'Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HERE are millions of persons associated with the Catholic and Protestant church organizations who desire to know the truth and to do what God commands. If they are not permitted to hear discussed the truth of the Bible, then they cannot learn. The clergy teach the people the same doctrines that they were taught 1500 years ago. The Bible says that greater light shall come to the people at the end of the world. We are now at the end of the world, and greater light has come, and the people must hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the truth when broadcast exposes to view the erroneous doctrines that have long been taught by men such programs are not an attack on clergymen as men, but are for the good of all honest persons because the truth is of greatest public interest, convenience and necessity. The Scriptures declare: ‘Let God be true though the truth make liars of all men.’ Note some of the doctrines taught by the churches for centuries but which now clearly appear to be erroneous and injurious to the people. One is the doctrine of “purgatory”, which teaches that when a man dies he is not in fact dead but that he is conscious in “purgatory”, undergoing punishment, and that a Catholic priest by praying for such one in “purgatory” may shorten the term of his punishment, and that the people should pay money for such prayers. The Bible shows such doctrine to be wholly false. The Bible teaching is that when a man dies he is completely dead, cannot feel or hear, and that he knows not anything, and that he is not undergoing punishment anywhere. If the Bible is true, and the doctrines of men false, which one should the people hear? If priests take money from the people with the understanding that it is pay for their prayers to get dead men out of “purgatory”, or to shorten their punishment, then that is obtaining money under false pretenses and is to the injury of the people. Is it more important to let the people receive the truth or to keep in vogue false doctrines by which they are injured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus was raised from the dead, and the Bible teaching is that His resurrection is a guarantee that all who have died shall be raised out of death. Jesus said (John 5:28, 29): ‘All in their graves shall come forth.’ It follows that those in their graves are not undergoing punishment. The proof shows that your beloved dead are not in “purgatory” suffering, but that when God’s kingdom is established all the dead shall be awakened and your loved ones brought back to you. Is the truth more comforting and important to the people than the “purgatory” doctrines which enable selfish men to gain money? Should the people have the opportunity to hear what God’s Word says and then each one decide for himself what he wants to believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy say that only they can interpret the Scriptures. The Bible says the Scriptures are not of private interpretation. God makes it plain that His due time has now come for all persons to understand the Bible who try to understand it. Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to your attention these great and important truths that you may know what the Bible contains and thus learn the truth and be free from superstition, error and false doctrines that do injury to you. Jesus said, ‘Learn the truth, and the truth shall make you free.’ Get the books that Jehovah’s witnesses bring to you, and thereby learn the truth of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Honest persons desire peace, prosperity and life. There is only one way to learn how such blessings can be obtained, and the Scriptures disclose that way. Jehovah God is the Giver of life, through Jesus Christ, but no one can receive a gift without having a knowledge that the gift is offered to him. The clergy talk to the people only about the schemes of men for the peace and prosperity of the world. God in His Word declares that the kingdom under Christ, alone, will bring peace and prosperity. The clergy tell you that the world is growing better, and you know the facts show to the contrary. The Scriptures show that the great crisis has been reached and that the most terrible trouble is just ahead and the only way to escape that trouble is to learn and to follow God’s instructions. There is nothing of such great importance to you as a knowledge of the truth, and for that reason Satan and his agents are trying to suppress the truth. But the Lord declares the message of truth shall be established for ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More About “Religious Susceptibilities”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fTVIE MONITOR,</span><span class="font7"> official organ of the archdiocese of San Francisco, gives space to the following item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Montreal, Jan. 11 (NCWC).—An interesting decision on the question of religious liberty was handed down here Monday by Mr. Justice Charles Wilson of the Quebec Superior Court, in dismissing appeals made by 12 members of the International Bible Students Association from convictions of the recorder of Ste. Rose, Que.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The 12 were found guilty in connection with the propaganda methods. They gathered outside the parish church at Ste. Rose last August and distributed pamphlets to the worshipers as they left the chureh after mass and stopped to discuss their beliefs with them. They were arrested and found guilty on charges of violating the Lord’s Day Act and of acting in a manner likely to cause disturbance of the public peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mr. Justice Wilson, in rendering his judgment, said that there was a difference between the exercise of religious liberty and license to offend the religious sensibilities of fellow-citizens. He pointed out that if the group had hired a hall to voice their views no offense would have resulted, but, he added, their action in interfering with citizens peacefully leaving their own church was a different matter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Justice Wilson is to be congratulated on stating what will or will not offend the religious sensibilities or religious susceptibilities of certain people. But his decision is open to question. In a certain section the Catholics and their religious susceptibilities were so profoundly disturbed and offended that when a hall or theater was hired for the purpose of giving a Bible lecture they saw to it that the speaker was surrounded by machine guns and the place was overrun by “officers of the law” heavily armed. You can never tell about religious sensibilities. They don’t seem to have a thing to do with what is fair, honest and just. In fact, the more there is of religious susceptibility, the less of justice, truth and righteousness. It is wonderful, too, what you can get by with when you start hollering about your hurt “religious sensibilities”. You can put it all over on the judges and “officers of the law” who would</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">fTIHE </span><span class="font7">Atlanta </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> gave no intimation, some months ago, that there had been a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in that city during which thousands of individuals went from house to house, without interference, presenting to the people the gospel of the Kingdom, in printed form. Later, however, when forty of such workers were arrested and jailed by the lawless police of the little city of Griffin, the Atlanta “news’ paper in question took pains to mention it and to say that they “were reported to have been selling anti-Catholic literature”. The press is not interested in giving the people the facts, but in so misrepresenting the facts that the iniquitous oppressors of the people, political, financial and ecclesiastical, including the lawless police, may continue a little longer in their &quot;work of spoliation. Incidentally, that little tell-tale lie, “anti-Catholic literature,” shows who were the ones behind the crime of illegal arrest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">rpHE eagerness with which the Associated -®- Press welcomes an opportunity to dishonor the name of the Most High is evidenced from the wide publicity given to the following item, which certainly contains no news value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Birmingham, Ala., Dee. 21.—A Negro approached a window in the license inspector’s office to-day to buy a tag. As the prospective purchaser gave his name the clerk’s pencil stopped; he glanced up in surprise. “Is that your name, or the,name of some chureh organization?” Jenkins asked. “It’s my own pusonal name,” the Negro replied, displaying a bill of sale to prove it. Jenkins passed over the tag. It was issued to “Jehovah Witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This item was given considerable prominence in the press, but when a convention of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses assembles or when a petition circulated by them receives millions of signatures, the public press is entirely silent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">the free expression of opinion in various ways is increasingly manifest in the affairs of America. A bill to censor motion pictures and to prevent the portrayal of certain unwelcome truths is now under consideration. Among other things, the bill provides that no motion picture would be granted a license if not in accord with public welfare; for instance, such pictures as deprecate or ridicule public officials, or officers of the army or navy, or offend the religious beliefs of any person, creed or sect, or ridicule ministers, priests, rabbis or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">recognized</span><span class="font7"> leaders of any religious sect. In other words, the clergy are to be made to appear an irreproachable group, whatever they may be in fact. From this standpoint, it would be improper, for instance, to portray the episode enacted in a New York hotel in which a Roman Catholic priest got a newly married couple well drunk and then took the lady to his own room, thinking the man was asleep. The man followed and caught the priest and the woman together, killed them, and also shot himself. Isn’t that enough to shock anybody’s “religious sensibilities and susceptibilities”? But it happened in real life, so why not stop such things in reality before attempting to suppress their portrayal? Let the truth be told.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">WO students of the University of California,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Los Angeles, were suspended because they refused military drill, basing their refusal on religious grounds. The United States Supreme Court upheld the University’s authorities in suspending the students, declaring that the military training requirement is constitutional. The court held that no conscientious objector, student or not, has any constitutional immunity from military service. This in spite of the fact that Jesus said, ‘They that take to the sword, shall perish by the sword.’ The weapons of the Christian’s warfare are not carnal, the dog for a walk, has organized a Dog Walking Service, and will take out a dog every day for $5.00 a month up per dog. We venture the suggestion that the Dog Walking Service provide each dog walker with a shovel, broom and container. This equipment seems to be a necessary item in the fine art of dog walking. Other refinements may be added with the advancement of science. Of course, it would be much better if there were no dogs to be walked in the city at all. The country is the place for dogs.</span></p>

The Santa Monicans decided that this was too much for its commuters, and so set about to provide municipal transportation service. Motor coaches or buses, 33 feet long, were purchased, eight to begin with, and others were added as needed. They weigh eight tons each, and carry 31 passengers. By this time the original buses have been driven 700,000 miles, four others have covered 500,000 miles, and two bought still more recently have 300,000 miles to their credit. And the fare is now 15c to Los Angeles, the distance from Santa Monica to that city being divided into three 5c zones. The bus line pays its executives less than private companies do, but the drivers receive 50-percent more than do drivers of a competing privately owned transit company.</span></p>

Heirs and dependents of the 134 who died in the disaster have brought suits against the company for more than $1,000,000, but the company went into Federal court and asked for an order limiting its liability to $20,000, in spite of the fact that it had already arranged to collect several millions in insurance. An American steamship company finds it more profitable to lose a ship than to salvage it, hence an “SOS” is likely to be delayed, even though passengers are in danger.

If it celebrates a new enlightenment, why does Mussolini say, ‘We must furnish the brains of our people less sumptuously in order to build up their character/ and then spend money intended for schools to the building of battleships? If it corrects our institutions, why has Mussolini found it necessary to announce five times the establishment of corporative state, officially, and yet no such corporative state exists? If it means a frank facing of facts, why is there such a tight censorship on news from Italy, so that we hear of the many peasant revolts and farmers’ uprisings by letter only months later? If Fascism inspires the respect of the masses of Italian people (and I have far too great faith in my own people to believe that), why does Mussolini find it important that when the people vote they vote ‘yes’ for Mussolini on a blue ballot and ‘no’ on a pink as guards watch?”</span></p>

On Saturdays and Sundays the lad need walk but one way. Two of the boys chose the reformatory sentence, but one of the boys chose the better part. Throughout the bitterest winter weather, at last accounts, he was walking out his 1,248 miles. He is not allowed to accept rides. He will emerge from his experience in better condition physically, mentally, and morally than the boys who chose the reformatory sentence.</span></p>

In fact, we do not take their word regarding their doing away with aluminum utensils, as we always test them for this poisoning each time they come to the office for treatment. In the two years we have been preaching against these utensils we have had only three patients who would not co-operate with us.

<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">UCH of the advice found in so-called “health columns” is written by individuals who know on what side of their bread the oleomargarine appears. Wonder why they are so anxious to tell you that aluminum cooking utensils are O.K.? And again, they are sure that white bread is all right for you, even though, if you eat enough of it at one sitting, it forms a sticky and pasty mass in your insides which acts as a plug somewhere on the way through your anatomy. Then these wise “health” writers will tell you that, of course, you need the roughage that there is in the grain, but this can be supplied in some other way. So then, there is the very sensible procedure of removing your roughage from the grain and then supplying it in some other way. Why not leave it there in the first place, in the proportion and balance in which the Creator provided it? Also, the mineral salts in the grains are a very valuable and important part of it. Why remove these and lose the benefit to be derived from their assimilation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Selling Cooking Utensils</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">rpHE GOLDEN AGE</span><span class="font7"> does not care what kind of cooking utensils you use. It isn’t even concerned if you insist upon using aluminum of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font7"> kind. That is your privilege and responsibility. But it will not cease to warn those who are interested in their health that aluminum is injurious to the health in numerous and various ways. There is no question about this whatever. Thousands of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tests</span><span class="font7"> upon human creatures (not guinea pigs), though unwittingly made, prove that aluminum is poison. The aluminum trust may as well use the metal for some other purpose, for people are going to stop using it, more and more. The foregoing statement is made because of the following vague item which appeared in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific (?) American:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Statements to the effect that the use of aluminum cooking utensils causes cancer or other grave maladies or of the increase of such disorders among the users of such utensils, will be discontinued by an individual engaged in the sale and distribution of cooking ware, as a result of a stipulation [?] of the Federal Trade Commission. Several other representations will be abandoned by this individual, [ ?] including one to the effect that thousands of people are dying every day from cancer because of their use of aluminum cooking utensils, and one to the effect that doctors and hospitals are now advising people against the use of aluminum utensils because of poisonous effects.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also, the Tacoma </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> carries a large advertisement that “Aluminum Is Not Injurious to Cook With”. This is all very interesting; for the more the advertisements say that aluminum is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font7"> poisonous, the more people will suspect that there is something rotten in Pittsburgh. Now what would you think of a person who came to you with the assurance that he or she was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font7"> a thief, and insisting loudly that you ignore any statements to that effect? You would consider him rather odd, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are numerous doctors who warn their patients against the use of aluminum, and there are thousands of persons who have found out through painful experience what effect food cooked in aluminum is likely to have upon them.</span></p>

Now, if these ladies had been reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> nothing of the kind would have happened. The newspaper reporting this poisoning bee mentioned the aluminum container by name, a flagrant breach of Mellon etiquette.

It’s the greatest curse of the civilized world, the greatest international racket. . . . The war never brought this country anything. A few insiders made the profits. The International Nickel Company earned 1,800 percent profit. The government bought $20,000,000 worth of mosquito nets. And there wasn’t a mosquito in France. Thirty-five million pairs of shoes, for only 4,000,000 men, when every pair of shoes would last a year. One billion dollars’ worth of airplanes that wouldn’t get off the ground. . . . Amend the Constitution and change the method of declaring war. . . . Let only those who are going to do the dying do the voting. The story would be different. I beg of you not to espouse a cause of any kind that might force us to war outside the United States. Let’s be sure our homes are in danger before we fight. It’s up to us. It takes courage.

But what does the Bible say? “He went down with them [Joseph and Mary], and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.” (Luke 2:51) “Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?”—Mark 6:3.</span></p>

The church has recognized this and is detouring from philosophy to science.” No doubt this explains why “the church” has so long been trying to feed the people on such pills as “eternal torment”, “inherent immortality,” “trinity,” etc., and kept them from the food which the Word of God contains. The bishops appear to have much in common wdth their flocks as far as “intelligence” is concerned. And the flocks for the most part show that they are not so moronic as their leaders credit them with being. At any rate, many of the sheep are turning down the pills and looking for real food.</span></p>

This body of men was called “the Danites”, and killed those who were likely to be dangerous to the “Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints”. That was their job, their bloody oath binding them to obey the “prophet”, Joseph Smith, and his successor, right or wrong, and never to tell anybody about the source of their orders. Porter Rockwell was the most notorious of the Danites, and has at least a hundred murders charged to his account.

By what strange twist of the human mind can a body of men whose lives are presumably dedicated to the one altruistic profession in the world, the tenets for whose guidance contain the injunction, “Thou shalt not kill,” solemnly repudiate the specific teachings of the Book and ally themselves on the side of the jingoes and the munition makers? It is a sad thing when the guides of human conduct retreat into the murk of reaction and substitute the words “unconstitutional, disloyal, unpatriotic and unchristian” for “faith” and “hope” and “charity”. And as to ‘playing on the emotions’, what body of men other than the clergy have recourse to that expedient oftener than the gentlemen who have passed these harsh, militaristic resolutions?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus came to His temple in the spring of 1918. There the sleeping saints were awakened. There the purification of the truth began. “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith [Jehovah] of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto [Jehovah] an offering in righteousness.”—Malachi 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is of great interest at this juncture to have a little table of Jehovah’s calendar for this period. The hours, except for the top line, are assumed, to fill out the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One dare not say that the anniversary, in 1918, of Jesus’ resurrection marked the exact date of the resurrection of the members of His body, but it would have been a most appropriate day. According to the Devil’s calendar it would be four days earlier in the year than the day of Jesus’ resurrection (because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Redemption 1</span><span class="font7"> in A.D. 1918 was 4 days earlier than in 33), and it was one day earlier in the week, but the correspondency is very close, and there seems no harm in holding to the thought that on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gods-day, Redemption 16, Y.R. 1886</span><span class="font7"> (Sat., March 30, A.D. 1918), the sleeping saints were awakened.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Freedom is on the way, and will be here in God’s due time. It is not God’s will that men should be slaves to Big Business, Big Politicians, Big Clergy, or any other kind of “big guns”. All these have been hard taskmasters. Under moon No. 73607, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Freedom 22, Edenic day No. 2173682, Y.R. 1892</span><span class="font7"> (Friday, July 25, A.D. 1924), at Columbus, Ohio, was sounded the third trumpet, “Civilization Doomed,” exactly ten years, to the day, after the opening of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73631, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Earthday, Freedom 3, Edenic day No. 2174372, Y.R. 1894</span><span class="font7"> (Tuesday, June 15, A.D. 1926), the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine first announced </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font7"> This book is perhaps the first ever published to be dedicated to Almighty God. Its chapter on The Deliverer (96 pages) is the finest life of Christ ever written. This work has encouraged millions to anticipate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">freedom</span><span class="font7"> in God’s appointed way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73644, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Freedom 24, Edenic day No. 2174776, Y.R. 1895</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, July 24, A.D. 1927), at Toronto, Ontario, Canada, there went out to all the world the message “Freedom for the People” on what was, until then, the greatest radio broadcast in history, and which broadcast was free. This message, the sixth vial of God’s wrath, was a message of freedom for all who desire truth and righteousness, and they are to be found in all walks of life. The Lord is impartial. No one is necessarily condemned by Him because of having some of the good things of life, or necessarily approved because he has little, or vice versa. For example: A business man said, “Sure, I will contribute $1 for your books, but what I really want is that lecture, ‘Freedom for the People’; I heard it, and consider it well worth $1 of any man’s money.” An evidently wealthy woman said, “Of course I want what you have shown me: I heard that lecture; that man took his life in his hands to give the people the truth.” Though it was their masters that sought and accomplished Jesus’ death, yet it was the servants that “plucked off the hair” and spat in His face. It was this lecture that caused the fourth month to be called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vindication</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, in the Day of Jehovah, it fully appears that the key to an understanding of the Scriptures is in the vindication of God’s name. Under moon No. 73657, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightday, Vindication 18, Edenic day No. 2175154, Y.R. 1896</span><span class="font7"> (Sunday, August 5, A.D. 1928), at Detroit, Michigan, there was delivered to all the world the message that Jehovah God is the peoples’ Friend, and His name will be vindicated by the establishment of a righteous government in the earth. At that time two of the most important books in the world were released to the people, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font7"> which has been placed in the hands of every important public official, besides several millions in other hands; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation, </span><span class="font7">which latter is a plain statement of the gracious provision Jehovah has made to bring all men into full harmony with Himself, that the obedient ones may have everlasting life on earth in contentment and complete happiness. Among intelligent, thinking people, no other such constructive work on government<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark46">7</a></sup> has ever appeared as the work first named. It presents indisputable evidence showing that the peoples of earth shall have a righteous government, and explaining the manner of its establishment. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses make the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font7"> book their leader, as it goes to the heart of all the difficulties of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most fascinating pictures of the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name is that provided by the book of Job, first explained in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font7"> This book, also, was the first book to have a chapter heading “Vindication”. The work was issued under moon No. 73669, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Vindication 7, Edenic day No. 2175498, Y.R.1897 </span><span class="font7">(Monday, July 15, A.D. 1929). In this book it now plainly appears that the terrible experiences of the prophet Job represent the awful experiences that have befallen the human family under the reign of Satan, but as Job finally was granted a great deliverance, so mankind is coming grandly into the golden age of glory and peace and joy and divine blessing everywhere promised in the Holy Word. One of the hardest things mankind has had to bear under the reign of the Devil has been the brand of “comfort” (?) provided by the purveyors of hell-fire or purgatory at so much per.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73694, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Vindication 13, Edenic day No. 2176243,</span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Y.R. 1899 </span><span class="font7">(Thursday, July 30, A.D. 1931), at Columbus, Ohio, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font7"> Book One, was released. Under moon No. 73706, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Vindication 6, Edenic day No. 2176590, Y.R. 1900 </span><span class="font7">(Monday, July 11, A.D. 1932), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font7">Book Two was released. A week later, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Heavenday, Vindication 13, Edenic day No. 2176597 </span><span class="font7">(Monday, July 18), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> Book Three was released. Jehovah's holy name will be vindicated by the elimination of all unrighteousness from the universe. The testimony of Ezekiel’s prophecy, sealed until the publication of these books, announces the judgments of God against all, in heaven or in earth, that have participated in the defamation of the name of the Most High. Since these studies were completed, God’s object in writing the Scriptures, and the manner in which they are to be understood, are clearly revealed. In the last of these three wonderful books the Jonadabs (people of good will foreshadowed by Jonadab) are Scripturally identified as the “millions now living that will never die”. The destruction of the Devil and all his forces is imminent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hope for fallen man is a gift from God, and is so stated in His Word. Under moon No. 73547, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Hope 10, Edenic day No. 2171897, Y.R. 1887</span><span class="font7"> (Friday, September 5, A.D. 1919), at the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Cedar Point, Ohio, the house-to-house witness work was covenanted by Jehovah’s people, and has since that time resulted in placing about two hundred million pieces of literature, many millions of which were bound books (and the rest booklets), in the hands of the people, for their comfort, their uplift and their hope in the dark hours of this dark day before the dawn of the glory just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was under moon No. 73584, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mansday, Hope 15, Edenic day No. 2172996, Y.R. 1890 </span><span class="font7">(Friday, September 8, 1922), at the second international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Cedar Point, Ohio, that the spirit was poured out upon all flesh. (Joel 2:28) There all of Jehovah’s people became publishers of the truth. There ended the 1290 days of Daniel 12:11; there began the 1335 days leading up to the peculiar blessedness upon the people of God. (Daniel 12:12) The world may as well know of these facts: their value will be apparent to all in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73596, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Hope 11, Edenic day No. 2173347, Y.R. 1891</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, August 25, A.D. 1923), at Los Angeles, California, “the Second Angel” sounded The Warning (a resolution). Man has hope, yes; but hope brings responsibilities which cannot be set aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73621, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Hope 8, Edenic day No. 2174082, Y.R. 1893</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, August 29, A.D. 1925), at Indianapolis, Indiana, was adopted the resolution called “Message of Hope”, from which this month takes its name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Order and Peace—at Last</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73661, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">TAfeday, Order 2, Edenic day No. 2175256, Y.R. 1896</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, November 15, A.D. 1928), there was published in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> the truth about the Great Pyramid; and the same subject was continued, under the same moon, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Order 18, Edenic day No. 2175272, Y.R. 1896</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, December 1, A.D. 1928). The removal of this entanglement from the paths of Jehovah’s people has been a great blessing and has resulted in order and peace where before there was disorder and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73673, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lifeday, Order 25, Edenic day No. 2175634, Y.R. 1897</span><span class="font7"> (Thursday, November 28, A.D. 1929), the work </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy </span><span class="font7">was released. Never before has there been a book published that makes clear so much of the prophecies of the Bible as this book. Because it is now God’s due time to make clear His prophecies, any unbiased student can now see much of the fulfillment thereof. An understanding of prophecy establishes faith and confidence in God and lifts many burdens from mankind. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font7"> has brought order and peace to the minds of lovers of God’s Word in every land. (See chapters entitled “God’s Organization” and “Peace”.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73710, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Starday, Order 2, Edenic day No. 2176704, Y.R. 1900</span><span class="font7"> (Wednesday, November 2, A.D. 1932), the work </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font7"> was released. Two of the most beautiful books of the Bible, Esther and Ruth, are now due to be understood. In these dramas are set forth facts which are of greatest importance for all who love God and who are anxious to see the complete triumph of righteousness in the earth. The final conflict between the wicked and the righteous is just at hand. In this great crisis no man could preserve himself. But the book shows who will be preserved, and how it will be brought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under moon No. 73709, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Peace 14, Edenic day No. 2176686, Y.R. 1900</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, October 15, A.D. 1932), there was published in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> a resolution, publication of which was official notification that then and there ended the 2300 days of Daniel’s prophecy. (Daniel 8:14) It pleased God to thereafter have a cleansed sanctuary. Since then God’s people have had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font7"> in God’s temple. This was the occasion for the naming of this month. “And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.”—Isaiah 54:13, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Best at the Last</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, last of all and best of all, under moon No. 73737, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Godsday, Jehovah 27, Edenic day No. 2177526, Y.R. 1902</span><span class="font7"> (Saturday, February 2, A.D. 1935), the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font7"> was released to the public. This book, it is to be hoped, will give Jehovah His rightful place in the hearts of millions. The month which is named for Jehovah God takes the place of what, under the Devil’s calendar, was the first month of the year. In His own expression of His will on the subject, God has made it clear that the first month of the year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{Redemption)</span><span class="font7"> is appropriately named as has been done in this series of articles. “Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself.”—Isaiah 45:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some may wonder whether by calling a month “Jehovah” the name will be brought into common use. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font7"> be brought into common use. Men need to think about God, the Source of all their hopes and joys, as well as of their present and future life itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Under the circumstances it does not appear that any valid objection can be raised to the use of this name to take the place of that of the present first month of the Devil’s calendar. And, anyway, people who have been writing “January” all their lives, in honor of the twofaced god of war, should be quite willing now to often write the name of the true and living God. The due time has come: Jehovah God will not be pushed into a corner any more. The theologians of the Devil can say nothing; they never have a kind word to say for Jehovah; some of them have freely admitted that they do not know anything about Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not counting the combinations above mentioned, the name Jehovah appears in the Scriptures 6,587 times; yet, in the King James, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version,</span><span class="font7"> it is translated by that name but four times: Exodus 6:3; Psalm 83: 18; Isaiah 12:2; Isaiah 26:4. In a single chapter in the original Hebrew (Deuteronomy 28) this name occurs forty times. “Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God. And again they said, Alleluia. . . . and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.... The voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”—Revelation 19:1, 3,4, 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"> Others have fancied the plagues extended over long intervals, months or even up to 2% years, but the reverse view, i.e., that Jehovah God was there to deliver His people and to absolutely crush all opposition by continued and ever-increasing pressure, seems much more reasonable, especially in view of the fact that the expression “tomorrow” occurs so repeatedly in the account. Exodus 7:7: “And Moses was fourscore years old . . . when [he] spake unto Pharaoh,” coupled with the fact that he died just forty years (lacking 16 days) afterwards, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">proves</span><span class="font5"> that the plagues all occurred in less than two months up to the passover in the spring of 1515 B.C.</span></p>

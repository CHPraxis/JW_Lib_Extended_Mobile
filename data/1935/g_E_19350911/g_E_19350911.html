<p><span class="font9">“What Is Fascism?” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By David Wilkie (Great Britain) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font6">HE Church of Rome is definitely not a “religious” body such as, for example, the Baptists, the Congregational church, the Unitarian church, or the Salvation Army. It is a religio-political organization, as much political as religious. The pope regards religious belief merely as a means to the realization of world dominion, an “empire” ruled over by the Roman Society of Priests, of which he is the head. Of course, he is bound to pretend to his followers that he is acting only as their spiritual chief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jesuits have captured the Church of Rome; the pope, indeed, is their nominee. The Jesuit Order is the “political priesthood” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(per se)</span><span class="font6"> of the Church of Rome. Both the general of the Jesuits and the pope are capitalists, or rather financiers, of world-wide influence. It is the Jesuits who are the real managers, the organizers, and the financiers of Fascism throughout the world. They work behind the scenes, of course, using other people as their tools (and many as their dupes) as they have always done.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>An All-Time Political Machine</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Think over this carefully. According to official Roman Catholic figures there are, roughly, 400 Jesuit priests in Great Britain and about 2,880 in the United States. Has any political party in the country a larger staff of full-time organizers than this? These Jesuits know the innermost secrets of almost every Foreign Office in Europe. Has any party in the country a better intelligence service? In this country, too, they have their agents and spies, i.e., Roman Catholics, in the press, the police, the army, the civil service, in society, and in all political parties.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JESUIT CONTROL OF THE WORLD —BY FASCISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is difficult to popularize a tyranny, and, as everybody knows, the Roman Catholic hierarchy Is the most perfect example of tyranny the world has known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Job of the Jesuits is to make it seem desirable, even necessary, that the government of mankind should be turned over to the Roman hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The curiously interesting methods by which men are persuaded to put their worst enemies In control of their destinies are set forth In this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer of the article, a university man of high standing, conceals his identity under a nom de plume. He is one of the few men who, having Inside knowledge, dares tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Every reader of The Golden Age will be fascinated, but more than fascinated; for he will be Instructed as to Just how the Devil is working his game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The article takes down the screens and lets the honest reader see Just how the Jesuits are planning world control by Fascism, and how they are succeeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">If liberty is lost, all is lost; and liberty is lost wherever the Jesuits succeed in forcing a dictator upon the people. This the people sagely suspect.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">They have tremendous funds at their command. What’s to stop the J esuits from capturing political power in any country ? They have the machine; all they need is a political “story” and a “party”. Fascism supplies both the story and the party. Its “creed” (promptly cast overboard by every Fascist leader the moment he comes to power) is simply a salestale to put Fascism across a gullible public in order to establish, in the end, a Jesuit dictatorship. Every Fascist is merely a tool and a dupe of the Jesuits. The rank and file do not know this, but their leaders (who are “in the know”) do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Socialists have made the mistake of reasoning that a movement, in this case Fascism, which stands for “private ownership” must, necessarily, be “capitalist”. Socialists have missed this fact: that “private ownership” existed before “capitalism” was heard of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Church of Rome’s ideas about property are not the same as “capitalism’s”. Fascism wouldn’t be Roman Catholic if it were capitalist.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Fascism an Instrument of Rome</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Fascism is not an instrument of capitalism;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">it is an instrument of Rome. Its aim is not to “reinstate” capitalism, but to take advantage of the political and economic situation in its entirety to re-establish the political supremacy of the Vatican. This, to use Cardinal Bellarmine's words—the “pontifical supremacy”, temporal as well as spiritual, remember—is the “fundamental article” of the Roman Catholic religion. The aim of Fascism is to establish, by force, the Romish rule, and to continue it by force, with book-burnings, suppression of the press and of freedom of speech, and with the torture and terrorist methods of the Inquisition up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the course of its history the Jesuit Order has been expelled from the following countries and places (by Roman Catholics as well as Protestants), not for religious reasons, but on political grounds:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is worth recording that when Pope Clement suppressed the Jesuits on August 21,1773 (they were “re-established” by Pius VII, in 1814), part of his words were: “We have remarked to our deep regret that our admonitions to them (the Jesuits) to serve God and not to mix themselves up with other matters, especially secular and political, and many other practical measures, have been almost powerless and of no effect..</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Let the Scoffers Scoff</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">If I regard the Jesuit Order as a menace (as I most certainly do), I can support my attitude, as the above table shows, by saying that this has been the experience of generations of governments and statesmen in every country in Europe. Let the scoffers scoff that off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take away from the Communist party the Catholic-born element in Glasgow, Dundee, Newcastle, Liverpool, Bristol, and Cardiff, and it is a well-known fact that the Communist party in Britain would cease to exist. Take away the Scoto-Irish element in Scotland, and the Anglo-Irish element in England, in London and Liverpool particularly, and there would be no “Communist Party of Great Britain”, Every member of the House of Commons </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">knows</span><span class="font6"> that the Catholic population of Britain is the spawningground for the Communist party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth about Communism and Fascism is that there is ample evidence to show that the Roman Catholic church has been, and is, the spawning-ground of both of them. (This is exactly ■what was “arranged” in Germany; the Roman Catholic Rhineland w<sup>T</sup>as the hotbed of “Communism”, and Roman Catholic Bavaria the homing-ground of “Nazism”.) The Communist party in Britain, and in most countries, is one half captured by the Jesuits, and the fake, promoted, systematic conflict of these two antidemocratic forces, &quot;Communism” and “Fascism”, is a conspiracy to lead the public to accept “Fascism” as the alternative to “Communism”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Tammany Is a Sample</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Any man who ignores the existence of the Jesuit order is unfit to govern. They are the Grand Masters of Devilry behind Tammany Hall (the U.S.A. Roman Catholic graft institution called after “St. Tammany”); the Zinoviev Letter; the murders of President Duca of Rumania, Barthou, King Alexander of Yugoslavia, President Obregon of Mexico, Sir Henry Wilson; the “Holy Vehme”; Eugene Chen (really a Mr. Bernard Achem, a R.C. from Trinidad); the Moplah risings in India; Ivar Kreuger; the Zimmermann Note; Senor Gil Robles; Skoropadsky’s Ukrainian “Nationalist” movement; the “Protocols of Zion”; the German-Irish Society; Adolf Hitler; etc., etc., etc. The climax of their machinations during the last 100 years is, they have virtually recreated the “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire” in the heart of Europe —Fascist Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Hungary. And these countries, as “swords of the Vatican”, are about to plunge Europe into war, to spread the power of the Jesuits over the rest of Europe by military force.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Fascism in Austria</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">To get the exemplar of the Vienna massacre one has to turn to the history of the Albigensians in France, or the massacre of the Huguenots, begun on St. Bartholomew’s Day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The growing influence of Admiral de Coligny filled Catherine de Medici with terror. An attempt to have him assassinated miscarried, so she ordered, purely as a ‘measure of public safety’, the murder of all Protestant leaders in Paris. The provinces adopted the measure, and between August 24 and October 3 fifty thousand Protestants were put to death. For that Catherine received the congratulations of all the Roman Catholic States, and the pope celebrated the occasion by having a special medal struck and bonfires </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lighted. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The late Dr. Dollfuss, dictator of Austria and a “zealous” Roman Catholic, was leader of the Austrian “Christian Socialists (i.e., Roman Catholic) Party”. His successor, Dr. Schusnigg, is the leader of the Austrian “Clerical Volunteers”; he is another very “zealous” Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The massacre in Vienna was St. Bartholomew’s Day over again, with Austrian Social Democrats taking the place of French Huguenots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one side were ranged the Social Democrats ; and on the other, as Fascists in the army and in the Dollfuss front, the “Holy Roman Catholics”, the minions of the pope. The result was the holocaust of St. Bartholomew’s Day over again: “Rationalism” instead of “Protestantism”; the slaughter of men, women, and children; cruel and ruthless—worthy of the superstition-sotted, confession-poisoned, priest-drenched dupes of the Haroun of Rome.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Dollfuss Massacre</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">“The papal nuncio in Vienna and the Catholic bishops Gfollner and Waitz were pushing the Government (i.e., the Dollfuss regime) forward along the path to Fascism. Here was the right opportunity, they thought ... to transform Austria into a Catholic authoritarian State,” says Otto Bauer, the Austrian workers’ leader, in his pamphlet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Austrian Democracy Under Fire,</span><span class="font6"> page 22. It was, in fact, the bishop of Linz and Mgr. Sibylla, the papal nuncio, who urged Dollfuss to begin the massacre, said Otto Bauer (see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Times</span><span class="font6"> February 18, 1934). The Roman Catholic “statesmen” in the preDollfuss Government, Vaugoin, Bishop Seipel and Prince Starhemberg, paved the way for Dollfuss’ “iron rule”, just as the succession of Roman Catholic chancellors in Germany, Wirth, Marx, Bruening, and Papen, prepared the way for Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font6"> Roman Catholic paper, April 6, stated: “The new Constitution (of Austria) now to be promulgated is based upon the conception of a Catholic Corporative State.” The first article of the old Constitution laid it down that “Her laws originate from Almighty God”. In plain English, Austria’s laws will henceforth originate in the will of the pope, who is “God Almighty’s” interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything Austrian in the future is to be worked in the interests of one man, Ambrose Ratti, a foreigner and a tyrant. That’s what the Fascist “patriots” have done for Austria!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected, therefore, it was reported in the Austrian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reichpost,</span><span class="font6"> March 23, 1934, that Bishop Innizer had been made “leader” of the Youth Movement in Austria. And the Vienna correspondent of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New Statesman and Nation</span><span class="font6"> stated, July 14: “Workers’ rights survive on paper, or rather as Catholic workers’ rights in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Einheitgewerkschaftsbund,”</span><span class="font6"> i.e., Unity Association League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then came the murder of Dollfuss. And after Dollfuss, Dr. Schusnigg was appointed chancellor. Schusnigg is the leader of the “Ostmar-kische Sturmscharen”, the Clerical Volunteers! And Schusnigg has as his deputy Prince Star-hemberg, another papist, who marched alongside Hitler at the time of Hitler’s 1923 Munich ‘putsch’. Starhemberg is also the “friend” of Mussolini. Observe this chain of pals: Hitler, Starhemberg, Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who rules in Austria? The capitalists? Bunkum. The capitalists, like the workers, have the thumb on them. Austria’s laws “originate” from “Almighty God”. “Almighty God” rules in Austria: “His Excellency,” “His Eminence,” the pope. As a London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font6"> correspondent reported, Austria is now an “Autocratic Roman Catholic State”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Fascism in Spain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">There are two Fascist parties in Spain. One is led by Gil Robles, and the other by Primo de Rivera, eldest son of the late monarchist-dictator of Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a pen portrait of Gil Robles in an article in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font6"> (Britain) May 17, 1934, by Don Fernando de los Rios, late Spanish minister of education and foreign affairs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the first speech of his electoral campaign last year, he (Gil Robles) spoke of the necessity of purging Spain of Jewish sympathizers and freemasons. At a recent mass meeting of his supporters at the Escorial, where they took an oath of allegiance, they had to repeat, hands lifted in the air, that ‘the leader can do no wrong’.’’ Just a political version, you see, of the “Papal Infallibility’’ doctrine—“The pope can make no mistake.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Spain the attachment of the Roman Catholic church to Fascism is open and unconcealed. It was reported in the Spanish press, April 1, 1934, that three Roman Catholic priests had been arrested for taking part at a Fascist meeting at Oviedo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Spanish Fascist movement is frankly one of “Catholic reaction” (to use Mr. Vernon Bartlett’s expression, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hews Chronicle,</span><span class="font6"> March 13, 1934) against the recent Spanish reforms, which drove out the Jesuits, prohibited priests from interfering in politics, and gave Spain a democratic constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other Fascist party in Spain, led by Primo de Rivera, calls itself “Falange Espanola”. That there is no breach between “Nazism” and “Fascism” is illustrated by the following from the Madrid correspondent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“J.O.N.S., an incipient Nazi organization, has recently concluded an alliance with the Fascist group, Falange Espanola, whose leading spirit is the young Marques Primo de Rivera.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, Primo de Rivera’s younger brother visited Sir Oswald Mosley’s Fascist headquarters at Chelsea, London, some time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is a report from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> of June 4,1934. The headlines, crossheads, and bold type appeared in the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FRUSTRATED BY PHONE ERROR</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Secret Plan Revealed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Nuncio Who Got Wrong Number</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From our own Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MADRID, Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A telephone comedy of errors that has resulted in a diplomatic upheaval between Spain and the Vatican has just been revealed.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark55">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days ago, shortly before the Spanish foreign minister, Senor Pita Romero, was due to leave for Rome to negotiate the concordat with the pope, Monsignor Tedeschini, the papal nuncio in Madrid, rang up a secretary at the Vatican in order to instruct him secretly on how to deal with Spain’s foreign minister when he arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By a curious coincidence the name of the Spanish attache at the Rome embassy is almost identical with that of the secretary at the Vatican whom the nuncio was ringing up, and by an error at the Rome telephone exchange the papal nuncio at Madrid was connected with the attache at the Spanish embassy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ASTONISHED DIPLOMAT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All unaware that he was talking to the wrong man, the papal nuncio gave the Spanish attache confidential instruction to extend to the Spanish foreign minister every hope of the early signature of the concordat, but to delay the actual signature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason, he confidentially explained to the astonished attache, was that he felt sure that Senor Gil Robles, the Spanish Fascist and Catholic leader, would soon be in office and then the concordat could be arranged on terms more favorable to the [Roman] church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attache hung up the receiver without revealing his identity and immediately rang up the Madrid foreign office and gave word for word the secret instructions he had just involuntarily received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NUNCIO CONFRONTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The acting foreign minister, Senor Rocha, then called on the nuncio, who blandly expressed his confidence that the concordat would soon be signed. Senor Rocha cut him short by showing him the full text of the secret instructions that the nuncio had just phoned to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite his great diplomatic experience it was some time before Monsignor Tedeschini found his breath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He finally explained that he had acted under Senor Gil Robles’ formal promise that he would soon be in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This diplomatic comedy is much commented upon here and the Labor papers are demanding the withdrawal of the Spanish envoy in view of the Vatican’s duplicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This exposes the trickery the “Holy” Roman church is capable of; and it shows, too, quite unmistakably, what Fascism is in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[Continue:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a special correspondent of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Science Monitor</span><span class="font5"> reported, July 24, 1934: “That Spain’s problem is now definitely Vatican versus Labor is a conviction that is rapidly growing.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rising in Asturias in October of last year was a fight between reformers and Jesuits for Oviedo city, the center of the Spanish armament industry. The Reformers were beaten, owing to the introduction against them of levies of Moors, and the treachery of certain Catalonian leaders. Since the Asturian rising the Spanish Fascists and the Roman Catholic-owned press have been loudly demanding a wholesale slaughter of the leading spirits of the rising. The Government, however, more wary than the fanatical Fascist-Clericals, has turned a deaf ear to these demands. The vigor of the Asturian defense, many of them miners, by the way, and the knowledge that what the Asturians stood for has many friends in Spain, and in Europe, has prevented the Government from committing further excesses which might inflame the Reformers, and tempt them to another rising which, if it did not succeed—and it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">might</span><span class="font6"> (there are not enough Moorish janissaries to cover the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">whole </span><span class="font6">of Spain, and even if there were their employment on a national scale would in all probability defeat its object)—would at least do incalculable damage.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Honest and Overzealous Reformers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Reformers made the mistake at the beginning of the revolution of being overzealous in the application of their democratic ideals. &quot;Without any apprenticeship in the new ideas, votes were granted to women, and the women, easily swayed in the confessional and still in fear of the priests, voted for the friends of the Clerics and against reform. Characteristically, no sooner did the reactionaries find themselves in legal control than they started to abuse their authority, to use all the forces of the state at their disposal to subdue and crush the opposition by force. It was this that caused the Asturian affair. Fortunately for the Reformers, stalemate has been reached, owing to the fact that they (i.e., the Reformers) have many sympathizers in the army and the police; otherwise there would have been no necessity to use Moors in Asturias. The reactionaries (Fascists) are straining every nerve to raise a dependable private army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spain, where the “Holy” Inquisition came into being (the appellation “Holy” reminds one of another “Holy”, which has not yet received pontifical blessing, however, the anti-Jew, Nazi “Holy Vehme” in Germany), is, no doubt, a fertile soil for anti-Semitism. Gil Robles’ cry of “Down with the Jews!” and the overt Jesuit alliance with Gil Robles definitely identifies the Jesuits in Spain with anti-Semitism. For centuries Roman Catholics have hounded Jews with the cry of “Christ Killers!” When, or where, did a Jew ever prosper in a Roman Catholic country? It was a pope who compelled Jews to wear the so-called “Medal of Infamy”; and the establishment of the Inquisition (established to hunt, burn, and torture Jews in Spain) was sanctioned and confirmed by papal decrees, and the Constitution of the Inquisition was drawn up by a Dominican priest, Dominicans were the “judges” of this awful secret tribunal, and Dominican novitiates in many cases acted as the torturers. (It is significant that, during the reign of the “Bloody Mary” in England, the Dominican house was at Smithfield, where the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">autos-da-fe</span><span class="font6"> were held.) Within living memory Jews were massacred in Limerick, (R.C.) Ireland, on the charge, the timeworn one, of holding a “Black Mass”. One cannot conceive of such a thing’s happening in Protestant England, or Scotland, or Wales. Indeed a “Black Mass” has no significance or meaning to anybody but a Roman Catholic. And in France, at the time of the Dreyfus affair, it was Papists and Jesuits, as is historically well known, who were ranged openly against Dreyfus. The defeat of the anti-Dreyfusites was followed immediately with legislation against Roman Catholicism—in which Jean Jaures, who was assassinated in 1914, took a leading part.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Anti-Semitic Propaganda</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Fascists in Spain will make the most of anti-Semitism. &quot;Whether it will help them any, or much, is a moot point. Anyway, it will take more than ingenuity to prove that there is anything like a “Jewish menace” in Spain, where, until the revolution, the Jesuits were the big landowners and business monopolists. The only “menace” there is in Spain (and it is obvious to anybody who looks for one) is the menace of a corrupt, absolutist “Church”, supported by secret orders, who brought Spain to decay and its people to depths of illiteracy—as they reduced Poland, too, to impoverishment and, finally, servitude.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One more quotation, from an article on Spain by a V. S. Prichett in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Fortnightly Review, </span><span class="font6">July, 1935, a highly reputable British magazine: “The question is, What will Senor Gil Robles do ? Before last October the answer was some kind of Fascism; now it is, Nothing this year. His strength is that he has the rich and powerful backing of the adaptable Jesuits . . . The Jesuits have already bought up many of the best provincial newspapers, and they are determined to redeem Spain from anti-Clericalism, Socialism, and indeed Liberal policy . . . for Spanish clericalism will put the clock back if it gets the chance.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>For Dirty Work, Call the Jesuits</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">And again from a recent observer, a Leah Manning, an ex-M. P. for Islington, London, in her newly published book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What I Saw in Spain, </span><span class="font6">calls Gil Robles’ party “a Vatican party”, and “a Jesuito-Fascist organization”. Yes, in Spain the Jesuito-Fascist alliance is stark and obvious. It is indeed not an “alliance”, for Gil Robles is a tool of the Jesuits, not an equal. And the same is true of every other Fascist boss in Europe (and candidate for the job), but in most cases the truth is hidden from public view by the Jesuits, the world’s masters in the art of “back stage’ politics, as well as the world’s champions in the art of 'gulling’ the masses. To make the people of Italy believe, when it is expedient, that Mussolini is not a militarist, but a cooing dove, is surely child’s play to a gang of experts who have been making almost whole nations believe, for generations, that a bit of paste is the body of the Son of God. If they (i.e., the Jesuits) have not a correct appraisement of the gullibility of mankind, after a 1,000 years’experience at the game, then who has? It is a historical truism, When you want dirty work done, call in the Jesuits. But (and since this is an article on Spain, the simile is becoming) the Jesuits, like the Moors who were invited to Spain, have the knack of pinching the prize which they have been called in only to safeguard. They got their postwar start in Italy, thanks to the—at least neutrality, of U.S.A., Britain, and France (and they got a start, too, in Poland), and now it won’t be their fault if they don’t soon own and control a half of the continent of Europe. But alas! and fortunately for others, it is also a historical truism that the triumphs of the Jesuits are always short-lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Protocols of Zion”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font6">N the trial at Berne, evidence was produced that the so-called “Protocols of Zion”, an alleged scheme of the Jews for a world supergovernment, were the work of a Russian writer named Nilus, and consisted, in 170 passages, of plagiarisms from an essay written by the French author Maurice Joly, in 1864, entitled “A Dialogue in Hades Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu”. The Jews never had anything to do with these protocols, yet it was because of these that the Nazi persecutions in Germany were begun and carried on with such bitterness. Efforts to prove that the Jews had discussed these protocols at the first Zionist Congress at Basle in 1897 were proved to be false. Two stenographers who attended all the sessions testified that the published report of the Basle proceedings was correct in every detail and that the subject of the protocols was not even mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“In one of the two rooms a six-year-old boy licked the paper bag the meat had been brought in. His legs were scarcely any larger than a medium-sized dog’s leg, and his belly was as large as that of a 130-pound woman’s. Suffering from rickets and anemia, his legs were unable to carry him for more than a dozen steps at a time; suffering from malnutrition, his belly was swollen several times its normal size. His face was bony and white. He was starving to death. In the other room of the house, without chairs, beds, or tables, a woman lay rolled up in some quilts trying to sleep. On the floor before an open fire lay two babies, neither a year old, sucking the dry teats of a mongrel bitch. A young girl, somewhere between fifteen and twenty, squatted on the comer of the hearth trying to keep warm. The dog got up and crawled to the hearth. She sat on her haunches before the blazing pine-knots, shivering and whining. After a while the girl spoke to the dog and the animal slunk away from the warmth of the fire and lay down again beside the two babies. The infants cuddled against the warmth of the dog’s flanks, searching tearfully for the dry teats. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“We are black, and that means we are nothing. There is no sanctity for our womanhood; any white man can insult us, and we have no redress. We want education and the chance to emancipate ourselves. The teachers sent to us are not always qualified, and their educational standard does not reach above the second grade. It is wrong for the Government to take girls away from the tribe as soon as they reach the age of 14: when placed at domestic service they are often seduced by white men. The missionaries use the blacks for their own ends, and what do my people receive in return? We do not resent the white people’s being here, but we think we should all be given some part of the land that was ours, so that we can make a home. Our people should be educated, and then we would cease to be what we are now, and become an asset to Australia. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">South Sixth Street, St. Louis, Mo., a printed prayer to St. Jude asking for favors and then encouraging him to do his bit by putting up the following argument: “I promise you, O blessed Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor and I will never cease to honor you as my special and powerful patron to do all in my power to encourage devotion to you.” At the start-off the prayer helps to get Jude in the humor to do something, by the remark that “the name of the traitor has caused you to be forgotten by many”. Ordinary novenas, i.e., silent prayers represented by the burnings of candles for nine days, $1; hanging lamps instead of candles, $1.50; candles for thirty days, $3. This is really 10 percent off. The method by which Jude takes these burning candles as just so many prayers is not explained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">' ‘ Few people in the United States, and this country too, have any conception of the power that the Roman hierarchy exercises over the press and freedom of opinion. A number of years ago a French Canadian editor started a campaign for a better educational system for the French boys and girls, in order that they might be on a better footing with their English-speaking brothers and sisters. His worthy efforts cost him a newspaper. The hierarchy broke him at once. The province of Quebec is one of the most backward spots on the face of the earth. Sufficient radical opinion exists in a country like France not to permit too extreme clerical oppression. The recent trials of Jehovah’s witnesses in the city of Quebec are other examples of the same tyranny.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font6">N Exodus 20:4 is the specific command: “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath.” Would you suppose that in the face of that command anybody on earth would dare assume to try to make a picture of Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the One that issued the command? But here is a so-called “Enrollment Certificate” that certifies that the deceased members of such-and-such a family have been enrolled as beneficiaries of our 'spiritual treasury of good works for the holy souls’, “to share for all time in all the masses, prayers and missionary labors of the missionary servants of the most holy and blessed trinity. [Signed] Rev. Theophilus Milroy, M.S.M.T., Holy Trinity Heights, Silver Spring, Maryland.” While attempting to analyze the picture some observations and questions intrude themselves. The largest single object in the picture is the “Spiritual Treasury for the Holy Souls”. In the picture it is 5-7/8 inches long. The next biggest thing is the priest, with his back turned to the audience. From the tip of his fingers, holding aloft the little piece of bread, to the hem of his lace petticoat is 3-13/16 inches. The next largest item in the picture is styled “Blessed Mother” and also “Dispensatrix of Grace”; height in the picture, an even 3 inches. Next in height is the figure of St. Joseph, also exactly 3 inches. Next in height is Jesus, still nailed to the 'cross’ and still bleeding. From the crown of His head to the point of His pierced foot is 2-11/16 inches. The priest, at 3-13/16 inches, is larger by 42 percent. The next one in size, according to the certificate, is God, seated upon His throne. Not counting the halo or the dove above, the length allotted is 2-7/16 inches, but would be somewhat more if standing, though even then less than the priest. Peter, standing, was allotted 2-3/8 inches. Heaven, according to the certificate, is much crowded. Apparently the apostles Matthew, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Simon Zelotes and James the Less failed to make the grade, for they are not shown, but St. Anthony, St. Catherine, St. Agnes, Little Flower, St. Ann, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Cecilia, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">St </span><span class="font6">Mary Magdalene, St. Joseph, St. Francis Assisi, St. John Baptist and St. Rose of Lima all got good jobs. Only two were carrying crucifixes ; none carry beads. The bake oven below the priest, shown in most such pictures, is omitted. The certificate is free, but friends of the holy souls are encouraged to give $10, $25, $50 or $100 as an alms; also to help pay the cost of the certificates, which, if they cost 2c each, cost too much.</span></p>

It is an allusion to the words of our Lord, 'You will find me in the heart of Gertrude.’” Those familiar with the Lord’s Word know exactly what it was that appeared to Gertrude for fifteen years; it was the same kind of creature that appeared to the witch of Endor and that besought the Lord that they might go into the swine. They just made a fool of Gertrude, and used her for forty-four years to keep others in ignorance and bondage; and she probably led them a hard life, too. As for the Lord’s directing anybody away from Jehovah God and directing them to the heart of a spirit medium as a place to find Him, there is not a shadow of truth in it.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH GOD is the King of eternity. His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, is the Prince or Rightful Ruler of the world, and one of His titles is Prince of Peace. He alone will bring everlasting peace to the peoples of earth. Before that peace can come the wicked organization of &gt;Satan that now rules the earth must be destroyed. Jehovah God is the Almighty Warrior against wickedness, and Christ Jesus is the chief one whom Jehovah uses to accomplish His purpose in war and in peace. It is written, in Ecclesiastes three: There is a due time for war, and a time of peace.’ The great and final war the Scriptures designate as ‘’the battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot;, or battle of Armageddon. Soon that battle will be fought by Christ J esus against .Satan and all of his forces, resulting in a complete victory for God and Christ. That victory will convince all creatures that Jehovah is supreme and that His name must be exalted for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present visible rulers of the earth are preparing for war and at the same time declaring their purpose to establish peace. They are doomed to complete failure in their efforts. Say the Scriptures (1 Thessalonians 5:3): ‘When these rulers shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction shall come upon them, and they shall not escape.’ Christ Jesus, at Armageddon, will destroy all workers of wickedness, and then will quickly follow everlasting peace. At Psalm 37:7-11 it is written: ‘‘Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evil doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.” The righteous government then shall control the world, and God says of Christ (Isaiah 9: 6, 7): ‘The government shall be upon His shoulder; His name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, the Prince of Peace; and of His government and peace there shall be no end.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the rule of the Prince of Peace will give the world everlasting peace it is written, at Psalm 72:7, “In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth”; and, at Isaiah 32:1-18, ‘He shall rule in righteousness, and the work of righteousness shall be peace, quietness and assurance for ever.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the babe Jesus was born at Bethlehem the angelic host proclaimed: ‘There is born this day a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, toward men good will.’ That great prophecy is now about to be fulfilled, because the Prince of Peace has come. Armageddon is near, and everlasting peace will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All honest persons desire a righteous government, under which they may live in peace. Christ, the Prince of Peace, will give just such a government to the world. Then the people will learn that “the love of Christ” means unselfish devotion to Jehovah God and that “the love of God” means His unselfish provision for the blessing of all who learn righteousness and do it. The people will then without hindrance come to a knowledge of the truth and learn righteousness, because that will be the time of the judgment of the Lord: as it is written (Isaiah 26:9): ‘When the judgments of the Lord are in the earth the people will learn righteousness.’ The Prince of Peace is the true friend of the people. It is for your highest welfare that you gain a knowledge of Him and His kingdom. The books that are brought to you by Jehovah’s witnesses will enable you to gain that much needed knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many are the precious promises contained in the Bible concerning the blessings of peace that God's kingdom under Christ will bring to the world. Note Isaiah 2:4: “He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” Give no heed to the vain schemes of imperfect men concerning peace and prosperity. Concerning the blessings the Prince of Peace will bring it is written (Psalm 85:10-12): “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.” The hope of the world is His kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An Ordinance That Failed</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font6">UTURE historians will wonder at the efforts made at Plainfield to prevent the gospel of the Kingdom from being proclaimed in that city as Jesus said it would be proclaimed before Armageddon, and as it has been proclaimed in spite of the ordinances passed to make the work difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses may now read the ordinance which was passed in the effort to make the Roman Catholic police chief of Plainfield the one to determine whether or not the commands of the Most High God shall be obeyed in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ordinance does not specify that Jehovah’s witnesses must have their heads shaved, their necks painted purple, their right arms black, their left arms yellow, the toe nails of their right foot blue and the toe nails of their left foot a brilliant carmine. Little details like that could have been arranged afterward, if any of the witnesses had paid any attention to the ordinance which follows, but they did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness work has gone on continuously, fearlessly, in the love and fear of God and of His Son, Christ Jesus, the King. There have been arrests, many of them. There have been trials which were mockeries of justice, grotesque in the extreme. Some of these have been described in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font6"> others were dramatized and sent into Plainfield over the radio; and meantime the work went right on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s faithful people in New Jersey have been true to their trust. They have been sentenced to an aggregate of years in prison, and have served their time and gone right back into the firing line. Meantime thousands of Plainfield citizens have signed written statements that they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">desire</span><span class="font6"> to have Jehovah’s witnesses call at their door, and that they do not wish the chief of police to have anything to say about their liberties in that respect. These tactics produced results, and now Jehovah’s witnesses in Plainfield, though still persecuted, are not the objects of attack they were. Had they not resisted the Devil to the end, the witness work in Plainfield would by now have ceased entirely.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">rpiIE defendants herein named, for the offense of telling the truth of Jehovah’s Word, were prosecuted and convicted at the instance of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. At the time they were committed to prison said defendants made and filed a statement of which the following is a copy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S King, by four of His brethren and fellow witnesses, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peter Semansky,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lena Albright, Ella Hering, Alice Rosendahl,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To Richard H. Thiele</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">as Recorder of the Township of Maplewood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New Jersey,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Greetings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your desire that four of Jehovah’s witnesses, herein named, present themselves before you Tuesday, the thirteenth day of August 1935, they acknowledge. They shall so do. To you now they say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S King, Christ Jesus, when on earth as a man, by request instructed certain wicked ones in language quoted now by three justices of your</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N. J. Division of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">New Jersey Supreme Court as ground for judgment by those justices entered against us during the past month, in their affirming the decision previously announced by your county judge, Brennan, in his approval of your own earlier conviction of us as violators of your Maplewood ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your New Jersey Supreme Court’s judgment of us states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;... The ordinance requirement is clearly directed toward a police effort to have knowledge of those who go from house to house and to have assurance that such persons are of good repute. Our study of the Scriptures leads us to the conclusion that the teachings thereof are very much to the effect that citizens should render themselves accountable to temporal authority in all matters so reasonable as that which is before us. Asked whether tribute should be given unto Caesar, the Master said, ‘Bender therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s. ’ Luke 20: 25. To say that obstinate refusal to seek the permit required by the ordinance is an act of worship is to say that disobedience of any statutory or ordinance provision may be so designated. We find no support for the argument that the ordinance is not applicable to the prosecutors or, so applied, is unconstitutional.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">And now, in obedience to the invitation and command of</span><span class="font5"> ALMIGHTY GOD, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">for information of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL TO WHOM A COPY OF THIS </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">statement shall come,</span><span class="font5"> we notify you that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That judgment of your New Jersey Supreme Court justices, of your county judge, and of you as recorder we must and do hereby publicly and happily CONDEMN AND REJECT as being both unsound and untimely as well as in utter contradiction of the superior written judgment and law of the Most High God, JEHOVAH.—Isaiah 54:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S written Word, at Luke 20:19-26, Mark 12:13-17, Matthew 22:15-22, shows that certain wicked clergymen and politicians conspired to “entangle” the Master, Christ Jesus, “to catch him in his words.” It is written that those wicked conspirators “sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: . . . they watched him, and sent forth spies . . . that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the [pagan Roman] governor. . . . But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites'?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus had not 'rendered himself accountable to temporal authority’ of pagan Rome in the “reasonable” matters in which those wicked politicians and clergymen thought by “their craftiness” to “deliver him unto the power and authority of the [pagan Roman] governor”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus recognized their hypocritical and wicked inquiry. Not as sincere seekers and learners of truth, but with an ulterior motive, those hypocrites asked the Master: “Is it lawful FOR US to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Selfishly and foolishly they asked. In accordance with law (Proverbs 26:5) of His Father, Jesus answered :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hathit? They answered and said, Caesar’s. And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That instruction Jesus gave at the request of and to HIS ENEMIES who sought to kill Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To His friends, who with Jesus willingly and joyfully serve His Father, the Master said: “If ye love me, keep my commandments . . . the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.” —John 14:15-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Jehovah’s witnesses it is our desire and determination to obey His voice as communicated through His written Word, the Bible. Every honest student of Jehovah’s Scriptures knows and recognizes that the commandments of His Word are superior to all laws, ordinances, statutes and commandments of human origin. Jehovah and His King Christ Jesus command that the good news of His Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, including Maplewood and other New Jersey communities, before His destructive vengeance is poured out upon all opposers of His Government. In obedience to that command we, when arrested in Maplewood, were carrying that message from house to house so that every one desiring to have an understanding of Jehovah’s purpose might receive and study the books and booklets and announcements of radio broadcasts setting forth that message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your New Jersey Supreme Court justices, your county judge, and you as recorder and your associated chosen servants of the residents of Maplewood unanimously say to us: “You cannot obey God’s command without first receiving a written permit from the chief of police.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PERMIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH God through Christ Jesus commands us to go from place to place and preach or make known this gospel of His Kingdom. Our failure to obey this commandment the Lord’s Word plainly tells us will result in our destruction. We love Jehovah and will serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding that the United States Supreme Court has held that this is a Christian nation, and that the laws of God are higher than man’s laws, your municipality by law says we must get a permit from the police chief to preach the gospel. For us to obey that law would be an insult to Jehovah and a violation of Jehovah’s law. Then we must choose either to obey God and live or disobey Him and die. If we obey Him, you send us to jail. If you were placed in the same position as we are, what would you do? choose prison and live or disobey God and die?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To us it seems far better and more consistent to refuse to ask for a permit, and go to prison in consequence at the instance of the papal Roman authority because we are telling the truth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Than to disobey Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and suffer complete destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may feel duty bound to obey your earthly superiors, but we remind you at the same time that you must take the responsibility to answer in due time before the great Judge of the universe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Devil’s prime minister, in the ruling just made that while civil cases may be appealed from Canada to highest British court, yet there may be no such appeal in criminal cases. This means that if a corrupt judiciary in Canada makes unjust and really treasonable decisions against innocent people, there is no redress except with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience Brings Promotion from Jehovah God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&lt;&lt;NTOW after that John was put in prison, J N Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.”—Mark 1:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a promotion! “For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another. For in the hand of [Jehovah] there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.”—Psalm 75: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fishing business is not a business that calls for fine clothing. Jesus said “they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses”. (Matthew 11: 8) Probably the kind of clothing Peter and Andrew wore was as different from that worn by their alleged successors, or by the clergy of their day, as could possibly be imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not sure where Peter learned “to curse and to swear” (Matthew 26:74), but being up all night on the tempestuous sea of Galilee, and fishing all night without even getting a bite, he would have some inclination in that direction. Maybe he heard somebody say something a little askew and could not forget it. Such things have happened. More likely, Peter was telling the absolute, naked, unvarnished truth when ‘Tie fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord”.—Luke 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It might be well just here to give the whole account as it occurs in Luke’s gospel; so here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. And Simon, answering, said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord. For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.”—Luke 5:1-11.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Peter’s Theological Seminary</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Peter’s book education was limited. In Acts 4:13 it says of him and John “that they were unlearned and ignorant men”; and the word “ignorant” is a translation of the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">idiotes.</span><span class="font6"> Maybe you have heard the word before, without the last two letters. Peter was not an idiot, but he was rude and unlearned, probably as rough as the bark on a tree, but at heart he was true-blue, honest, straight, square, upright, dependable, wanting to do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When John the Baptist came along preaching repentance it sounded good to all four of these fishermen, and they expressed their contrition toward God, and their desire to be found acceptable to Him, by believing John’s message, which surely means that they were baptized for the remission of their sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They even had some acquaintance with the Lord himself, because John the Baptist had pointed out to Andrew that Jesus is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. “One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.”—John 1:40-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peter was a man of some means, married, and with a home large enough to house a multitude. The account says of Peter’s home, where Andrew lived and where Jesus and James and John were also guests, along with Simon’s wife and her mother, that “at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him [Jesus] all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. And all the city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils”. —Mark 1: 29-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be set down as certain that Peter was a hard-working and what is sometimes called a hard-headed man. He saw through the scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites; he knew he was imperfect; he knew his comrades in the fishing business were imperfect; he was convinced that John the Baptist was a man sent of God; he was ready to do what God wanted him to do. All that, and much more, may have been figured out the night when he toiled all night and caught nothing. That boat, bumping around on Gennesaret’s restless waters, was better than a theological seminary.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>When the Lord Called Him to Come</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;When the Lord called Peter to come, Peter did not say, “Wait till I get a college education; wait till I get a degree; wait till I get yards and yards of black cloth, the finest made, woven into garments that will make me look like a Pharisee ; wait till I get into a collar backwards, with a tie that looks like the corner of an old bedquilt, and hook up with a string of beads and some other junk that will help the common people to see how pious I am, and then I will come right along, and between us we will put up the biggest game of graft and hypocrisy that was ever pulled off in Palestine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were too many of that sort in Palestine already. Peter knew it well, and so did the Lord. Did not Jesus hand it to that crowd, in Matthew 23, when He said: “All their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font6"> are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?”—Matthew 23:5,6,13,14, 15, 25, 27, 29, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably that was the way that Peter talked about the same gang before he ever laid eyes on Jesus. Do you remember what Jesus said about the pious fraud that stood and prayed with himself and patted himself on the back and told the Lord how good he was, and the other man, the poor publican that stood afar off, and would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner? When Peter told the Lord he was a sinner, the Lord did not pull a long face and begin to give Peter a lesson on character development. He had already sized Peter up for what he was, and knew that He could use him later to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Forget the Intervening Years</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Forget the intervening years, for a moment; they are but three in number. What is this great excitement that is going on in Jerusalem? Jesus has been put to death, and has ascended into heaven. The holy spirit has been poured out upon the apostles and the others in the upper room. The mouthpieces of Jehovah God have declared the truth in at least sixteen languages besides their native dialect of Galilee. Three thousand souls have been added to the believers. A man lame from his mother’s womb is leaping and praising God at the Beautiful gate of the temple. Somebody has said something to him in the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Annas and Caiaphas, and John and Alexander, and all the other scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites that Jesus trimmed have met in solemn conclave, and before them is brought the “culprit” that dared speak in the forbidden name, and when they demanded of Peter and John by what power or by what name they had done this work of healing, Peter, the same one that said he was a sinner, “stood up on his hind legs” and said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.”—Acts 4:9-21.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>What a Promotion!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus meant that Peter should catch fish for the Lord’s own net, but there seems no objection to another quite different thought. And so, what a promotion that was, from catching bass or pickerel or trout, up there in the lake of Galilee, to dangling those scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites on the end of the pole right there in front of the temple at Jerusalem, and watching them flop and twist and squirm to try to make it appear that they were still so righteous and holy and sanctified that God could not get along without them. But they were bad fish, cast away as unfit. Everybody in Jerusalem knew about it, and every person of good will in the city was openly or secretly on the side of Peter and John and the other apostles and believers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this came to Peter as a result of his obedience to the Lord. When the Lord invited him to come, he came. Just think of some of the other great privileges that Peter had! He was the first one to confess that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ of God. When the Lord invited all to leave Him who wished to go it was Peter who said, “To whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.” He was the one first privileged to take the gospel to the Jews, and the first one to take it to the Gentiles. He was taken up into the Mount of Transfiguration; he was the one privileged to walk on the water; he was one of those present at the raising of Jairus’ daughter; he was the one that elicited the information as to how far forgiveness may extend; he noticed the withered fig tree; he was one of the four who heard the Lord’s great prophecy of Matthew 24; he was one who was with Jesus in Gethsemane; he was one to whom an angel of God sent a special message after the Savior’s death; he was one to whom Jesus himself gave a special message after His resurrection; he was one who saw Jesus ascend into heaven; he was one who was sure of a glorious climax to his earthly career; he was one whom the angels released from prison. How few of humankind have ever had an angel slap them! Peter was one of the two apostles used in raising one from the dead. Peter wrote two epistles that have been of priceless value to the people of God. All this came as a reward of his obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peter made mistakes. Forget them; so did you. Prominent in the early history of the church, he occupied a humbler position later, after James was installed as leader of the church at Jerusalem and Paul was in charge of the work among the Gentiles. But prominence means nothing. Peter was where the Lord wanted him. He never aspired to be the earthly head of the church. The Lord never assigned that job to him or to anybody; that is something the heavenly Father reserves for Jesus himself.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Present-Day Applications</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Today there are about two thousand pioneers who have literally done what Peter and the other apostles did; they have left all to do the Lord’s bidding, devoting their entire time to preaching the gospel message from house to house. Theirs is the most useful and most honorable place in the kingdom of God today; the Bethel family at Brooklyn, N. Y., would increase the number by ten percent. Something like forty percent of all the literature placed is put in the hands of the people by these pioneers and Bethelites. Thousands of others have the same spirit and share in all their activities and experiences, as far as they are able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of these, as in New Jersey, and Germany, and Quebec, are often imprisoned as was Peter. Their life is strenuous, as was Peter’s, and interesting and exciting, as was his, to the last degree. Armageddon is just ahead. Today, today, they have the opportunity to suffer something for Jehovah’s name. Tomorrow it will all be for ever done. How gladly the angels of God would leave their places in heaven, if that were God’s will, to come to New Jersey, and go out in the work in Plainfield or Maplewood, and stand before De Meza or Thiele and say as did Peter of old, “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And recently the angels have heard some wonderful things of what God is about to do in Armageddon; and there will be more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Serums</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font6">N AN address before the American Chemical Society William B. Bell, chairman of a chemical company, said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the eight months ended February 1933, we imported 115,000 bushels of corn. In the eight months which ended in February 1935, we had imported 5,709,000 bushels—115,000 against 5,709,000. In January and February, the last of the eight months, we were importing at the rate of 23,300,000 bushels of corn. I happen to be very much interested in a company which generates serums in hogs. We have some 2,000 hogs in New York state, and several hundred horses. We are feeding them now on Argentina corn. Our collections from Argentina, where we have a branch office, have greatly improved. Business is pretty good down in Argentina. We imported 20,000 bushels of oats in 1933. The current rate of importation of oats is 13,000,000 bushels a year—20,000 against 13,000,000.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several things about this will interest Americans very much. They will be interested to see the skill with which the international bankers have persuaded the American people to pay American farmers for not raising corn and oats, so that they, the international bankers, could cash in on the loans they, the bankers (not the American people), made to people in Argentina and elsewhere. Moreover, some Americans will be mildly interested as to what becomes of the serums which pass through 2,000 dirty hogs.

What with poisoning the blood stream by aluminum hydroxide and poisoning it some more by serums made from sick calves, sick horses and sick hogs, is it any wonder that cancer is growing by leaps and bounds ? But the people that endorse aluminum cooking utensils and some 1,200 serums (one for each disease is the theory) are quick to say that nobody knows the cause of cancer. It is not altogether modest for a group of men to reiterate that because they don’t know a certain thing, therefore nobody else does; still some are like that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font6">HICAGO has medical liberty. The following is the ordinance passed by the city council January 13, 1926: “The board of health shall pass no rule or regulation which will compel any person to submit to vaccination, or injection of any virus, or medication, against his will or without his consent, or, in case of a minor or any person under disability, the consent of his or her parent, guardian, or conservator, and nothing in this ordinance contained, or in any other ordinance heretofore passed and in force in this city, shall be construed to authorize or empower any person or office to so vaccinate, inject, or medicate, without such consent, or to authorize or empower the said board of health to adopt any rule or regulation requiring or authorizing any such vaccination, injection or medication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Diphtheria Immunization Exposed</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font6">OMBINED effort is being made by the Medical Union and those of high public health authority to have us believe that there is great mystery surrounding the medical department of the healing art. These are so profound that the average layman is not supposed to be sufficiently intelligent to comprehend. When traced down they lead us to astounding facts and truths everyone should know for self-protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men at the head of health departments like those of New York and Chicago edit or control papers and bulletins, issued at regular periods, either with their own or with the use of public funds, presumably for health welfare; and we find they are copyrighted so that only a favored few can obtain them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A bulletin was published February, 1935, by the president of the Chicago board of health, which contains this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reproduction, either in whole or in part, or in any medium or form, strictly prohibited. [Signed] Dr. Herman N. Bundescn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can we as professionals intelligently show what these men write or discuss, when thus prohibited from quoting? Probably we are not supposed to. The Federal Bureau of Animal Industry sends its agents among the farmers to serumize, immunize, test for disease or kill at will. Already in some cities or states it is made compulsory that little children must be subjected to being poisoned by vaccination or serum-ized in order to attend public school. It will not be long, evidently, until a “Federal Bureau of Human Welfare” will be established; then we shall be treated in a like manner as the animals of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The item which Dr. Bundesen wrote mentions that the medics once used a toxin-antitoxin giving three injections to the child for a supposed immunization for diphtheria. Seven years ago a new method was discovered. They began using what is termed a “toxoid”. This apparently protected about 80 percent of children after three treatments. A little later science advanced to the point where alum was added to the toxoid. Alum is a salt of aluminum. This required two injections. So many of the children died following the second they discarded the toxins and now use an injection of an “alum precipitated toxoid”. Only one injection is necessary, and there is so little reaction in most cases that it must contain some magical power which brings diphtheria ‘under control in 100 percent of all the children thus immunized’.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Chas. T. Betts (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During past centuries we have had various kinds of medical fancies. It would be foolish to relate here many of the ideas which have been practiced and then discarded. In Washington’s time “cupping” (drawing off the blood by the use of leeches, etc.) was just the proper procedure to prevent or cure disease. This was done to the president; many believe he was bled to death. No one would accuse the physician of purposely murdering him. It was the ‘proper’ medical procedure at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In later years medical science rose to the point where a physician held a reverenced place in the hearts of man. The more advanced medicine became, the more learned the physician, the less the public is supposed to know about health. The laity is not to ask any questions. Mystery surrounds everything medical. Is it any wonder, under such a condition, thinking people have deserted physicians by the thousand and now by the million? Never in the history of medicine have the so-called “cults” so prospered. The more success these have, the greater the effort made by the Medical Association to have laws enacted through the control of county, state and national health departments to compel the public to take their medicine and, wherever possible, to prohibit others from practicing various departments of healing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why have the medics changed from using toxin-antitoxin eight years ago to a purely alum precipitated toxoid now? What will be used m a like period hence, or other substances supposed to have the magic wand to prevent diphtheria? This is an unusual change of procedure within that short period. A toxin, according to Gould’s Dictionary, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“An amorphous, nitrogenous poison, formed by bacteria in both living tissues and dead substances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shows that the offal of living organisms which include the dead bodies themselves becomes a potent poison. This was cultured in laboratories, and then injected into healthy children under the name of “toxin-antitoxin”. Through some magical process when placed in the body of a healthy child this was supposed to counteract the action of diphtheria germs for a period of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eight years ago the medics were just as positive of the efficacy of toxin-antitoxin for diphtheria immunization as the present officials are of alum precipitated toxoid, the only difference</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">being that the latter takes but one injection, while the former required three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An alkali is, in effect, the opposite of an acid principle; that is to say, when the alkali substance is mixed in proper proportions with an acid substance the acidity and alkalinity are both destroyed. The resulting substance is a salt. When aluminum is united with sulphuric acid in proper molecular proportions it becomes aluminum sulphate—a salt. Aluminum sulphate forms double salts with the sulphates of the metals of the alkalis such as sodium, potassium, etc. When these are combined an alum is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Edward M. Averill, examiner for the Federal Trade Commission, Docket 540, describes the origin of the word as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The English word “alum” is derived from the Latin word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">alumen,</span><span class="font5"> the Greek equivalent of which seems to have been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">stypteria,</span><span class="font5"> meaning astringent. The ancients applied this term to a number of substances of astringent taste. Chaucer used the word ‘ ‘ alum ’ ’ about 1336. Potash alum and ammonia alum have been known from early times, both have been made from alum shale, clay, bauxite and other aluminum materials, both have been used in medicine, and in tanning, dyeing, paper sizing and water purification. As chemistry developed, other salts were discovered of analogous composition and same crystal form in which other elements replaced the potassium or ammonium, and “alum” was applied as a generic term to the whole series. Alum: Any of a series of double sulphates isomorphous with common alum, in which the potassium may be replaced by sodium, ammonium, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several authoritative works will also be quoted here giving the definition of the word “alum”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Webster’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New International Dictionary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alum.</span><span class="font5"> A name given to a remarkable series of double salts, of which potash alum may be taken as the type. We can replace one—potash by soda. The following is a list of alums actually known to chemists:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Ordinary potash alum</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Soda alum</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Ammonia alum Ten others are listed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New International Encyclopedia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Common alum, as late as the eighteenth century, was regarded essentially as “aluminum sulphate”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alum is a neutral salt, consisting of sulphuric acid combined with luminous earth or fine clay, and merits, of consequence, the name of aluminum sulphate, or alum; at first affects the organs with a sweetish taste, and is afterwards felt to be strongly astringent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fourcroy Elements of Chemistry and Natural History:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sodium aluminum sulphate is anhydrous soda alum, has the same appearance and taste as exsiccated (burnt) potash alum or ammonia alum, and there are no substantial differences in chemical or physiological action between any of the three forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As “alum precipitated toxoid” is being used upon an extensive scale for the immunization of diphtheria, we have deemed it proper to quote recognized medical authorities as to their findings showing the evil effects of alum compounds upon the human body. Dr. H. Gideon Wells, M.D., pathologist, University of Chicago, gave testimony as follows, in Docket 540 Federal Trade Commission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds, if in solution, may pass into the blood stream by diffusion through the cells of the digestive tract. This diffusion may take place in any part of the digestive tract from the lips to the anus, so that the whole of the digestive tract may be affected. They may pass into the blood along with fats. The moment an aluminum compound has passed through or into the wall of the intestine beyond the surface and entered the blood vessels of the intestinal wall it will come in contact with the red corpuscles and cause these corpuscles to aggregate or clump and have opportunity to produce this injurious effect exactly the same as if the aluminum compound had been injected into the blood directly. The tendency to aggregate is a serious matter, since the aggregated corpuscles cannot pass through the capillaries of the body, and tends to clog them up. Experiments have shown that when metallic substances act upon red corpuscles to produce such changes in the corpuscles, the corpuscles become more fragile, break up more readily, and lead to anemia or the reduction in the number of red corpuscles in the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These results may occur because of large doses, but they may come from small doses of aluminum compounds administered over a considerable period. A small quantity acting for a long time may produce results quite as marked as a larger quantity acting for a shorter space of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The resistance of the intestinal wall to bacteria would be reduced, and they would get a foothold and begin to grow there when they could not do so in a normal intestinal wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two effects to be observed at the introduction into the human digestive tract of aluminum compounds: the direct effect of carrying the substance into the circulation, and an indirect effect in the intestine and in the arterial tract rendering the human organism more susceptible to disease.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">H. A. McGuigan, Ph.D., University of Illinois, wrote in his textbooks the following quotation:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum is classed with the heavy metals which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">exert their action in the form of soluble salts in two ways:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(a)</span><span class="font5"> Local action, due to combinations with proteins which classify aluminum—</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">With ferric chloride as styptic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the salts of lead, bismuth, zinc and mercury as astringent.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(b) General action as absorption in which there is little difference in the metals. Local absorption exerting a constricting action on the local vessels.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Physiological Materia Medica,</span><span class="font6"> by Wm, N. Burt, M.D., gives a lengthy description from which the following quotation is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CEREBRO-SPINAL SYSTEM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum produces most profound prostration of the animal nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. C. Cowperthwaite, M.D., published a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medica</span><span class="font6"> in which the seventh edition contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ALUMINA (PURE CLAY-ALUMINUM) GENERAL ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alumina affects directly the motor nervous system, giving a paralytic condition, but it shows its most specific action upon the mucous membranes, and of these the intestinal and vaginal are principally involved. The condition seems to be that of extreme dryness and lack of secretion, with more or less irritation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Arthur R. Cushny, professor in the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, has the following statement in his textbook published in 1906:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum has a very remarkable general action when it obtains access to the blood. In Siem’s experiments on animals the sodium-aluminum lactate or tartrate induced a very slow intoxication, mammals never dying from the effects sooner than one or two weeks after the intravenous injection of the salts. In frogs the symptoms were those of a descending paralysis of the central nervous system, the heart and the peripheral nerves and muscles being little affected. In mammals the first symptoms appeared only after three to five days, and consisted in constipation, rapid loss of weight, weakness, torpor, vomiting; marked abnormalities in movement and sensation were observed later, such as tremor, jerking movements, clonic convulsions, paresis of the hind legs, anaesthesia of the mouth and throat and lessened sensation all over the body. Before death, diarrhea often set in and albuminuria was generally present. The mucous membrane of the stomach and bowel was found swollen and congested, the kidney and liver has often undergone fatty degeneration, and hemorrhages were found in the renal cortex. Albuminum was found in the urine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTION OF ALUMINUM COMPOUNDS UPON HUMANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like the other members of the heavy metal series aluminum therefore acts on the bowel and kidney in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">general </span><span class="font5">poisoning, while many of the symptoms point </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to a </span><span class="font5">direct action on the brain. Dollken has recently confirmed Siem’s results, and showed that the nerve cells and fibres of the cord and medulla undergo degeneration, particularly those of the lower cranial nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After 1925, in collaboration with Florence Siebert, Ph.D., Dr. Wells investigated “The Effects of Aluminum on Mammalian Blood and Tissue”. The results of three years’ work were published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Archives of Pathology,</span><span class="font6"> Vol. 8, August, 1929, copyrighted by the A.M.A. A detailed description of their findings is given. Under “Comment” they tell of the results of the experiments in which aluminum compounds were injected into the blood stream of small animals like rabbits. The conclusion was that a marked anemia was often shown after the aluminum ion either in the form of sodium sulphate salt or as the chloride was injected. When the dose was large enough the animals died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A vivid description is given as to the effect on the tissues where the injection is made. Especially were these in marked evidence where the sodium aluminum sulphate was used. They are described as being affected with edema, inflammation, swelling and necrosis of the tissues and that the neighboring lymph glands were swollen. Under paragraph 6 is given information as to the effect upon the Iddneys, heart muscle cells, stomach and intestines, showing they become diseased to the point that lesions were produced; principally focal necrosis, fibrous pigmentation and thrombosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under “Summary”, paragraph 4, the effects of feeding small daily doses over a long period and the giving of a large dose at once showed similar results. They described that changes were produced in the tissues and the blood which indicated that the aluminum is absorbed through the intestinal tract. As this takes place the same poisonous effects are shown as those obtained by the placing of the drug directly into the arterial system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find these words of C. S. Smith, Ph.D., New York City, under the caption of “Colloids in Medicine”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nature of the charge varies with the solvent. In water, colloidal iron or copper or the hydroxides of iron, copper or aluminum are positively charged; while silver is negatively charged. The positive electric charge of aluminum hydroxide in suspensoid colloidal solution is particularly strong, and after intravenous injection increases the ionic concentration of the blood so as to produce shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago alum compounds were used generally before major operations for the purpose of thickening the blood. Its action was to “slow up” the circulation to the point where danger from the loss of blood was greatly minimized. The results were disastrous, due to embolism—thickening of all the blood; many died even though the operation itself was successful. This phrase became a by-word: “The operation was a success, but the patient died.” On account of this the use of alum solutions was practically discontinued. Now, after twenty years, they have revived its use, claiming it to be such a potent toxoid that one injection will make a child immune from diphtheria for a period of years. From newspaper reports which are constantly coming in, many are immunized for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few of the dead are here named:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mrs. William Barnes, New Haven, Conn., died a few minutes after antitoxin for diphtheria had been administered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doris Berkowitz, 3 years of age, Bronx, N. Y., died one hour after antitoxin was administered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">John Bagarisen, 4| years of age, 305 E. 28th St., New York City, died following two injections. The death certificate read “Acute poliomyelitis” (infantile paralysis) and a “serum accident”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Seventy-three infants killed by B.C.G. vaccine, in Luebeck, Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Precipitated alum which is injected into children for the immunization against diphtheria is also used for the purpose of embalming the dead, as a mordant in the making of aniline dyes, and making of bricks, sewer pipes and adobe houses. How medics can enjoy squirting such material into children or babies is beyond my comprehension, especially under the pretext of preventing disease. There may be a reason, however, which Dr. Bundesen mentions. He says the initial order for Chicago would be 40,000 units; these at 50 cents each would take $20,000 out of the Chicago treasury, plus the medical fees, which may be from three to five dollars per injection. If the profit for service is $200,000 or over for the first order of toxoid for Chicago, what would accrue to the medics of New York city? also that made by the City Public Health Laboratory from sales of the medicine ? Dr. Wm. H. Park, director, might be kind enough to advise you; he has not seen fit to answer our inquiries.</span></p>

It ought not to be necessary to argue the point with anybody that an institution which admits its intention to destroy those that disagree with it, as soon as it considers its power adequate, has no thought whatever of encouraging liberty or freedom. It is peculiarly disagreeable to honest persons, therefore, to read that Ryan, Cadman, Wise, and 250 other prominent Catholics, “Protestants” and Jews recently visited Washington to urge “an investigation of conditions throughout the country that limit the liberties guaranteed citizens . . . under the constitution”. It is as certain as the light that this is really a move to curtail and hinder and estop the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and when their program gets far enough along it is their unquestioned purpose to propose legislation similar to New Jersey’s hate bill. They realize that it is quite a job to put through hate bills in each of the 48 states, and that they must move quickly to gain their objective. Let them go to it. Meanwhile, let everybody reflect that the most important part of democracy is freedom of speech. “No free speech” means “no democracy”.</span></p>

These things, in America, are enough to make the framers of the Constitution turn over <sup>1 </sup>in their graves.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Age.</span><span class="font6"> An acquaintance of mine, Jack Wilgus, to whom I gave some copies, wrote the following article, which I am sending to you in the belief that you may be interested in giving both sides of a controversial question voice in your pages.” The article follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Communist Outrages Reported in New York.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I quote a heading from the December 5 issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> We can thank William Green of the American Federation of Labor for the information. We Communists rate William Green on a level with Father Coughlin, Reverend Cadman and plenty of others. He expounds with the fiery words of judgment, and cringes in submission before his superiors. His words are fiery, but his leadership is a betrayal. We quote as follows in this connection from another article in the same issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age:</span><span class="font5"> “Today there is an organized and subtle movement to take away from the American people liberty of conscience and freedom of speech.” Among the lieutenants of this subtle movement one finds Bill Green, Father Coughlin and William Randolph Hearst. They, with all the amplifying effects of press, radio and pulpit are reaping profit in the ugly business of muting the truth, lest any truths harmful to certain people’s security become too penetrating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communists carry no bombs, knives ... or seeds of hate. We are not the skulking night prowlers the Greens and Hearsts or Cadmans would represent us as being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be no idle waste of time to just ask ourselves what the Communists want, and how they are trying to get it, and other things about their activities which apparently the priests, bankers and labor misleaders don’t want us to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communists aren’t out to make money; on the contrary, one who is observant will see the followers of the hammer and sickle growing emaciated and ragged along with their intense work. They are laughed at by their old friends, doors are slammed in their faces, the police come charging upon them from the sidestreets, and they have handed them long jail sentences. Once in a while we read of a score or so of Communists being shot up against a wall, or tortured beyond recognition. Yet Mr. Green and Mr. Hearst and Father Coughlin would have the public consider such people a criminal element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We entered a world not many years ago, for we are mostly young, where men were segregated off into colors, nationalities and occupations. Now when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font5">are endeavoring to draw all these men and women together and teach the world that we are a common family, the defenders of the high priests, the apologists of the thieves, gather in conjunction among themselves and seek to have us thrown into jails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We Communists are forming into groups those people who have been ground down, who are hungry, and who might otherwise lose hope. Then we gather the groups into masses and at last we will consolidate all these peoples. For they have sowed the seeds, reaped the harvests, manufactured the goods, and carried all their handiwork to the warehouses, wherein it has been locked away from them. (We recall how the Carpenter went into the stock exchange of an earlier age and upset the tables of the Rockefellers and Morgans and Du Ponts of that day.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We build the phalanxes against wars. In every land we are ringing the immense gongs of alarm, to bring together peoples that they may prepare, not to slaughter each other, but that they may make common ground against war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The men who profit in billions on the agony and death of men raise their voices against us; they point to us and call us destroyers. They speak of us as advocators of violence, and we know who are the real advocators of violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We battle against war, but we know that there will yet be the great battle of all the world which we sing about in our song, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Internationale,</span><span class="font5"> and which we call the final conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our movement grows. Against it are opposed Hitler, who burns along with the books of culture the charter of the rights of man. Against us are the priests of the rich church trusts, and the men who are paid to wave their country’s flag. In common array they march against us Communists . . . for they hope in vain to destroy us before our voice is too well heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have never known a man or woman of deep religious convictions who has opposed the advance of Communism. For they know us for what we are, and we know them for what they are, and we have no battle to fight with them. It is not religion we are opposed to, but the thieves who are making a commerce of the things of the spirit, the priests and ministers of organized church. They make commodities of inspiration, hope, charity, love, and they profit by the very forgiveness God grants man in his frailty. To them we raise stern and unrelenting visages. We offer them no tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would drag these Coughlins and Greens and Cadmans and Morgans out of the high places and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font5">store those high places to the common people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">would open the factories and warehouses, so that men and women might eat and be secure. And then we would develop human nature, which the fakers so often demean. We believe that human nature is the ore from which there can be refined pure gold.</span></p>

The description of the convention activities was graphic, in fact, so convincing we could “smell’’ the writer from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font6"> magazine. I felt something should be done about him when I read his remarks in that said magazine, and the way you handled that gentleman of the press filled me with glee. I have been told </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font6"> is a papal oracle; so I am not surprised at his wisecrack about the powderless women. To gain his respect should they have been billowing around in yards of black drapery with a white frill around their shaved heads ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The women of Jehovah’s organization do not have time to powder and paint to look like a circus poster (nor do they want to), neither could they qualify as a model for cigarette ads. Nor do they spend their time toying with cocktail glasses, but if I might propose a toast (water will serve the purpose) it would be, ‘•Here is to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font6"> writer; we hold our nose as he passes by.” Maybe when Armageddon</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">But enough in defense of my sisters; the allimportant thing is the publishing of the message of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> is a grand magazine for the furtherance of truth; and may the Lord continue to bless your efforts as you use your special talent in His service.

<p><span class="font6">“Upon thy belly shaft thou go,” and, in Philip-pians 3:19, ‘Whose god is their flabelli.’ Do these refer to the same thing? No, no, little one, not at all. Somebody, probably, is just trying to poke a little fun at Ambrose's white flabelli and has mixed this up with Scriptures about the Devil and about the god of greed. But there is no relation between these three or four bellies, and, anyway, the word in Philippians 3:19 is really “belly” and not “flabelli”, even if the thought is much the same. Flabelli is feathers, ignorant one, not scales. <sup>1</sup> — — &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>

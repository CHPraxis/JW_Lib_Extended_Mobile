<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Very Hairs of Your Head Are All Numbered”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 10:30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4"> RED-HAIRED woman has on her head</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">30,000 hairs, a black-haired woman 110,000, and a blond-haired woman 150,000. A woman’s hair is coarser and heavier than a man’s. A man may have as many as 1,200 hairs in a single square inch on top of his head, thinning down to 160 per square inch on his face; all together, he has about twice as many hairs as a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The medulla: that is the inner part of the hair. The cortex is the part that surrounds the medulla. The cuticle is the skin of the hair. Below the surface of the skin of the body from which it grows the hair is surrounded by two layers of cells which surround it in the form of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">sheath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When hair starts to grow on a part of the body where it has not previously grown, the skin of the body thickens at that point until a plug has been thrust down through it. At the bottom of the plug the hair follicle gradually forms and the related parts develop, consisting of oil glands and fat cells needed to keep the hair in good condition. The hair is not hollow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The biggest hairs we know anything about are the horns of the rhinoceros. The spines of porcupines and hedgehogs are classified as hairs. The difference between straight hairs and curly hairs is that the straight hairs are round and the curly hairs are flat; the flatter the hair, the better it will curl. The hairs of all creatures are arranged on their bodies in an orderly manner, revealing wisdom, skill and art of the highest sort. They do not grow in hit-and-miss fashion; they grow according to design; in other words, they are numbered.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Egyptians Set the Pace</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is no limit to what mankind, and especially womankind, have done with their hair, but the Egyptians set the pace. The custom for centuries, for men, was to shave everything off. The priests used to shave their bodies all over every third day. It is supposed that this practice originated on account of the tendency of the climate to generate fleas, lice and other vermin that nest in the hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This practice accounts for the first mention of shaving in the Scriptures. This is where it is said of Joseph that when he was summoned to come in “he shaved”. Slaves were obliged to be clean-shaven, as to both their beards and their heads. Women wore their own hair, and wore it long, in Egypt, in ancient times, the same as they did in all other lands until recently. The men wore wigs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Egypt, in ancient times, a beard on a man was an indication of slovenliness. The same was true, at one time, in Rome, where, on one occasion, a man who had been banished for a time was ordered to have his beard shaved before he entered the senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the Jews long hair was admired. That of Absalom grew so luxuriantly that, according to Josephus, it was necessary to cut it every eighth day. Samson’s strength lay in his hair. Elijah had flowing locks, but Elisha was baldheaded. Solomon’s bodyguard wore their hair long. Solomon had a thousand other persons who were watching him closely who also wore their hair long.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Early Christians</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The early Christians were interested in something else besides fussing all the time with their hair; and it is interesting that on one occasion a criminal who pretended to be a Christian w<sup>r</sup>as proved to be an impostor by the luxuriant and frizzled appearance of his hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oriental women go to great lengths in the care they give to their hair. Both the prophets and the apostles have said something on this. At one time the ladies of the East wrought their hair into most fanciful devices, to represent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">coronets, harps, wreaths, diadems and other figures, and loaded it down with ribbons, gold threads, pearls, and what not. Some Arabian women have small bells concealed in their hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is less than 150 years since our greatgrandmothers affected the coiffure a la fregata. In this Marie Antoinette creation the lady of the period atop a face seven inches from chin to the roots of the hair had an exhibition made up of “rats”, “switches,” combs and gums and ribbons and the design of a ship that stretched upward for another full twelve inches. It took about a day for the hairdresser to make up one of these works of art (?), and it necessitated the lady’s sitting up all night. She had her hair dressed one day and night and -wore it the next for the occasion for which it was prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The old-timers believed in taking care of their hair. Here is one said to date from some thousands of years before Christ. It was to promote the growth of the hair of the mother of one King Chata, and reads as follows: “One pad of a dog’s foot; one fruit of a date palm; one hoof of an ass; all to be boiled together in oil and to be applied hot with a brush made of a horse’s tail once a week for a year.” Probably that was as good as any prescription for the same purpose since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Assyrians wore their beard and hair long, and their statuary makes them look like the breaking up of a hard winter. Alexander the Great changed all that. He made his soldiers shave, so that their enemies could not seize them by the beard. The American Indian shaved his head, except his scalp lock, which was worn in bravado; it said in substance, “Come and get my scalp if you can, but beware that you do not lose your own in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Slaves were not allowed to wear long hair. Maidens cut their hair just before marriage. When the Germanic races were conquered by the Romans their hair was cut off and used to make false hair for the dandies of Rome. The practice by men of cutting their hair short dates hack about 450 years. Ordinarily, a man’s hair, if uncut, will grow only to his shoulders, and when thus worn the man looks very well. A woman’s hair, being stronger, grows to her waist, and sometimes to her feet.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Changing Styles of Hairdressing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Probably there will never be any end to the changing styles of hairdressing. Henry VIII, of England, rounded his beard and married six ■wives in quick succession. Not sure if this is to be taken as an encouragement or a warning. More clever than Henry was King Archelaus. When his barber asked him how he would have his hair cut the king replied, “In silence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Russians go in for long and heavy beards; maybe the climate has something to do with it. When Ivan the Terrible was czar he was so charmed with the five-foot beard of an English envoy at his court that he asked permission to run his fingers through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not so many centuries ago, populous beards were so plentiful that when the selectmen of a community wished to choose one of their number for chief it was a custom to spread their beards on the table and into whichever one the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pedic-ulus capitis</span><span class="font4"> elected to make its home, he it was that was most looked up to by his fellow men. Frederick the Great, ruler of the country of which Hitler is now the guiding star, had visitors in his beard and was proud of it. The great Frederick was not the only lousy monarch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nowadays the ladies often comb their tresses in public; it used to be the style for a man to do it. A noble of the realm would stand in his scarlet suit, with pretty white satin cuffs, and comb and comb his natural hair or his wig, whichever one he happened to have, while behind him his valet would adjust the boo’ful curls after the comb had passed through them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the days of Queen Elizabeth a female might have on her head her own hair and in addition might be carrying around as many as two hundred tufts and loops pinned on where they would fit the best, or the worst. Women tried to make their heads resemble leaves, pyramids, globes, bird cages, steeples, and horns. The hair was propped with forks and wires into the most grotesque shapes. This was not in the South Sea islands, but in England.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Scipio Africanus Shaved Daily</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is said that Scipio Africanus was the first man to shave daily. He started all this argument about which is the best shaving cream, or whether the old-fashioned cake of soap is best; whether a he-razor is the thing, or one of these modern contraptions that is carefully designed so that it will yield not more than one good shave. Wait till Scipio wakes up and the men get around him to tell him what they think of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4">. Since he went to sleep the worm has turned many times, but, alas, the men keep on shaving; for it is the custom of men, having done a thing once, to do it forever and forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the sixteenth century French gentlemen used to have one lock of their hair left long. Into this lock, which was allowed to fall to the shoulder, the dandy had woven a switch given to him by his lady friend. The lock was called a lovelock. From time immemorial the men have earnestly tried to see what complete jackasses they could make of themselves over the women, and the women have ably assisted in every way in their power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Permanent waving dates from the days of Nero. One of the favorites of the old maniac stayed three weeks in a hot bath with her hair in curls, securely packed with clay. Jewelry of the times shows the marcel waves distinctly. It is from this beautifully engraved jewelry, by the way, that we obtain our best portraits of just how all these old-timers looked. In the British Museum one can see thousands of cameos which bring out in detail all the principal characteristics of the notables of twenty centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first patent for a modern permanent waving machine was taken out by a woman in 1873. Ivory hairpins were in use in London in the days of the Roman occupation. Some beautiful specimens are also to be seen in the British Museum. In Iceland, at one time, women wore their hair long (and perhaps do yet): single women with their braids over the left shoulder, and married women with them over the right shoulder.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Seventy-five Miles of Hair</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A woman with a good head of hair 36 inches long is said to be carrying around with her about seventy-five miles of hair, if the hairs were all placed end to end. The average rate of growth is half an inch or an inch a month. The rate of growth is greatest between twelve and thirty. The life of a human hair is six to ten years. Forty to fifty hairs drop out daily, but if the follicle is healthy a new hair takes the place of the old. The hair is the last part of the body to decay; there are credible instances where hair has grown several inches after death. A mummy exposed to the sun grew hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Germany, in ancient times, unmarried women wore their hair loose. In ancient Greece, just before a woman was married she had her hair cut off and offered to one of the gods. Only a few years ago the flowing blond hair that had once made up the beard of Andrew Jackson was on sale in New York. Peter the Great, of Russia, had an order in effect that all visitors to his court must be clean-shaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sunlight is good for the hair growth; food is of even greater importance. When a drove of cattle were fed on carrots their coats became heavy and glossy. When humans eat carrots they get the same result as the cattle do. Some raw food enthusiasts claim that by living largely on carrots, raisins, lettuce, spinach, leeks, strawberries, radishes, apples, prunes, cherries and blackberries they can even grow new hair in bald places, and that the new hair will be its natural color where the hair that fell out was gray. Sounds too good to be true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hair is quite inflammable, consisting of 50 percent carbon, 21 percent oxygen, 7 percent hydrogen, 17 percent nitrogen, and 5 percent sulphur, with a very little alkaline sulphate, oxide of iron, and silica. Women have deeper hair follicles than men, and a greater supply of sebaceous glands to nourish the hair.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Cause of Baldness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Baldness is caused by lack of nutrition. If you wish to get bald, wear a tightly fitting hat, one which cuts off the blood stream to the top of the head. To get bald earlier, wear the hat in the house as well as out-doors. To assist still further, wear a nightcap at night. Anything that will reduce the general tone of the system will cause the hair to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some causes of baldness which are listed by an expert are given in alphabetical order: arthritis, bleaches, blows, braises, burns, carbuncles, catarrh, crimping, curling, dyes, ear troubles, friction, frights, headaches, injuries, mental disorders, mercury, nervous diseases, ringworm, salves, scarlatina, sexual irregularities, shampoo excesses, skin diseases, sweating, tonics, tuberculosis, typhoid, venereal diseases, waving, worry wounds. Sounds as if most of us would have to get bald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hair grows faster in health than at other times; it reflects the state of the health; it grows faster by day than by night, and faster in warm weather than in cold. It is a great protection to any part, and is especially valuable in guarding the brain and nerve centers from shocks, injuries and irritations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In man to some extent, and in other creatures to a great extent, the hair is an organ of sense. There are muscles at the roots of the hair which, on occasions of extreme fright, tighten and in sa doing cause the hair, if it is not too long, to stand straight up. Who has not seen the hair rise on a dog’s neck, or a cat’s? Humans have more hairs than apes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Uses of Hair</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Do you wear clothes? If you do, you know that wool is a useful article. You use a pig’s hair to brush your teeth, your hair, and maybe your clothes. The artist uses brushes of skunk’s hair, camel’s hair and sable. The camel’s-hair shawl of a generation ago was a beautiful thing. Horsehair furniture was once quite the thing. Horsehair cloth is still used to stiffen other clothing. Mattresses, supposed to be made of horsehair, are stuffed with goat hair, pig hair and barbers’ sweepings. The making of human hair into curls, frizzes; false fronts, puffs and wigs is a large industry. The hair of the yak and of the goat is worked up into theatrical wigs and false beards. Cowhair, and hair of any kind, is used for certain roofing materials and for holding plaster together.

<p><span class="font4">Hair was once much used in telescopes, surveyor’s instruments, and clinometers; convenient alloys of metals have since taken their place for these purposes. The manufacture of hair ornaments was once a great industry. Nowadays nobody has the patience to make hair ornaments. Blond human hair is still used in an instrument, the aero-meteorograph, carried aloft by airplane pilots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No two persons have hair structure exactly the same. Mongolian hair is heavier than Caucasian; Caucasian is heavier than Negroid. The hair of the Negro contains an excess of air bubbles. There are a number of different styles of eyebrows. Those of an artist are of a distinct type. One hair, in the hands of an expert, under a powerful microscope, may prove to be a means of identification.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Brushing and Shampooing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is good to brush the hair thoroughly every night and in every direction; that exercises the muscles that hold it in position and stirs the sebaceous glands to pour out more nourishment for the hair. Massage is good; it exercises the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">same muscles; makes them strong, so they can hang on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When it is considered that the hair is, in effect, a plant, set down in a little pot filled with fats and oils, from which it receives its nutriment, it will be apparent why a reasonable amount of shampoos is all right and an unreasonable amount is all wrong. If one took a good shampoo every day in the week it is doubtful if he would have any hair in six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The experts seem to think a shampoo once in two to three weeks is about right. They recommend hot oil before the shampoo, and rinsing after the shampoo, with one teaspoon of salts of tartar and two teaspoons of strained lemon juice in three pints of water, to keep the hair light in color. For the shampoo itself pure castile soap, or olive oil, or castor oil, or egg yolk, or dry starch (this last for a dry shampoo), is recommended. One writer says, to shave up a bar of soap, add a pint of cold water, let it simmer until the soap has dissolved, then strain it through a double thickness of cheesecloth, and you have your shampoo made up into its best form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The statement of the wise man (Proverbs 16: 31) being most certainly true, and it being without question that a beautiful head of gray hair is one of the most beautiful things in the world, why be ashamed of it? A woman old enough to have gray hair who tries to make her hair look like that of a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl only gets herself laughed at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hydrogen peroxide, always used to produce blond hair, may catch fire and injure the patient for life. Copper, used to produce reddish tints, may cause skin eruptions or ulcers. Lead, mercury and silver nitrate, used to turn gray hair black, are all extremely irritating to the skin and highly poisonous. In Colonial days it was the custom for people to wear white wigs, which gave faces a youthful appearance and enhanced their beauty. Too much exposure to the sun is said to yellow gray hair. Instances are on record of fright’s causing an entire head of hair to turn white in a single night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To offset the fact that “gentlemen prefer blondes”, somebody has gone to the trouble of pointing out that 76 percent of persons convicted of crime are blonds. Don’t know what that proves, but there it is, anyway. Contrary to general belief, it is claimed that red-haired persons are mostly mild-tempered. Where any of them spunk up it is because they have been teased into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hair dyes are very popular among the natives of the north of Africa. Black hair is turned brown by a paste made from ashes. Hairstraightener is much in demand in the section of New York city (Harlem) where the bulk of the Negro population resides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one insists on dyeing the hair, it is claimed that camomile tea harmlessly brightens both blond and light-brown hair, that henna adds a reddish tint, and that bluing takes the glint out of either of the other rinses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People who are afraid of getting gray hair too young are advised to get easy shoes, with wide, low heels, and to do considerable walking, to eat foods that contain plenty of fruits and vegetables and few starches and confections. When rats were fed almost exclusively on the wheat germ their black and white hair changed to silver gray; when whole wheat was added the normal color returned.</span></p>

Hairbrushes are cleaned by the use of soda dissolved in cold water; hot water ruins brushes.

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Women and Bobbed Hair</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In 1928 the French government redesigned all its gold and silver coins. The best artists in the country were in the competition, with the result that not one of the sixty-four new coins bears the design of a woman with short hair. This is not saying that women should not bob their hair, though it is true that some barbers refuse to cut a woman’s tresses, believing it wrong to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Queen Mary of England dislikes bobbed hair; her influence has held back her daughter and her daughter-in-law from having their hair bobbed. Maids at Buckingham Palace may not have their hair bobbed. In Warsaw, Poland, a 64-year-old woman swallow’ed poison because her daughter sacrificed her beautiful tresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Germany a factory proprietor ordered all women employees to bob their hair or look for other jobs. It is unsafe for women with long hair to be about machinery. Accidents too dreadful to mention have occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cutting the hair too short is causing many women to become bald, or partly so. Many women have been forced to resume wearing long hair to cover bald spots, and some have tried to regain their lost tresses and been unable to do so. Chinese women took readily to having their hair bobbed. For some unknown reason the women all over the earth are eager each to look exactly like every other woman. In British workhouses the women inmates made such an outcry that it was necessary for the government to make contracts to provide them with the shinglings they desired. At Eatontown, N. J., the oldest woman in the town had her hair bobbed so as to make the town 100 percent. The only way a man in that town can see a woman with hair the natural length is to go to some other town for a look.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Zerbau, Germany, the city fathers voted a tax of 50 cents a month on each married woman who bobs her hair, and 25 cents a month for each woman over 14 years of age, unmarried, who commits the same offense. In the kingdom of Hedjaz, any barber found guilty of cutting a woman’s locks is sent to jail or fined. The men are wasting their breath. When a woman will, she will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is estimated that in Britain 20,000,000 women have had their hair bobbed or shingled. In the Mayfair district hairdressing is done by contract. Each client pays a certain sum annually, in quarterly installments, and for that sum is kept looking as nearly as possible like every other woman. American women are said to spend $1,000,000,000 a year keeping themselves beautiful. A single chain of barber shops in New York city, in a single year, had an income from women of $916,000, as disclosed by a lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few courageous women retain their hair full length. A Detroit girl has a braid that reaches to her shoe tops. In athletics or in a factory her hair would be a liability; but she seems to like it, and who would say she has no right to it? A significant fact is that women who have their locks severed always keep the shorn tresses. That shows that they are just the least bit uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A German girl of 24, the mother of two children, rightly suspecting that in these days the men fall for the long hair, pursued a successful confidence game in Berlin. She worked in a place until entrusted to take considerable sums to the bank, when she disappeared with the money, braids and all. In one place she got away with 2,400 marks, but the police got her in the end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Men and Bald Heads</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">You cannot have hair unless the roots are nourished by an abundance of blood; hence, a good, strong heart is necessary if one is to have a nice head of hair and keep it. Unless right food is put into the stomach the right kind of blood will not circulate throughout the system. If you wear a tight hatband, you may expect to discourage the growth of your hair. The frequent close cropping of men’s hair tends to cause baldness. The true preventives of baldness are in the food that comes to the roots of the hair through the food brought by the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is generally observed and conceded that a measure of baldness is likely in the case of all who perform constant intellectual work. There is a measure of truth in the aphorisms “Grass doesn’t grow on a busy street” and “A baldheaded man is seldom found in an insane asylum”. The bald-headed man can point with pride to the bald-headed eagle and also to the bald truth as standing at the head of the class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. B. Norman Bengston, Maywood, Hl., experimenting for two years on a man of 58, developed a complete head of gray hair on a bald head, and after several months’ more treatment this hair turned black. If that isn’t the truth, somebody will have to answer for it some time; but it won’t be we.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a New York wig store the proprietor employs three bald-headed clerks to exhibit wigs and toupees to the visitors. In one of the largest and most flourishing barber shops of New York city, where sale of hair tonics is an important feature, two of the salesmen are bald as billiard balls. Doesn’t that show that bald-headed men have their uses? Who was that savage who said, “No man is expected to develop both hair and brains”? He deserves a funeral. A tendency toward baldness may be inherited.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Permanent Waves for Men (!)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As women gradually take on the vices and follies of men, the men (some of them) take on the weaknesses and frailties of the women. A man cannot help it if he has naturally wavy hair, and it may even be admired, but what man who is a man wants to go to a beauty shop and have himself fixed up like a sissy? In Paris there is one barber shop exclusively devoted to male marcels. A special machine for permanent waves for men has been invented, and there are said to be numbers of them in use in America. Men have had to take a lot of advice as to how to shape and trim their mustaches, and, judging by the results, most of the advice has been bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A London business man interested in astronomy alleges that the hair should be cut just before a new moon, and not when the moon is full. At full moon the hair has the most sap. This statement is probably based on the gravitational pull of the lunar orb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some women are honest enough to say that they prefer men who do not keep their hair slicked to those that do. Seems as if a man ought to have something more serious on his mind than slicking his hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the bearded General Balbo was in America somebody said that beards were coming back into style. Well, they come back into style all right at about 6: 20 every morning, and require a good ten minutes to get them into the place where they belong. Napoleon said that great men shave themselves. He had that straight, anyway; hadn’t he, boys?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Oh! Just one more item. Here is one about a certain professor who sewed some hundreds of hairs into the head of a Miss Peggie Tudor, to cover a bald spot about the size of a quarter. Each pair of hairs was fixed into a gold ring so small it could hardly be seen with the naked eye. Then the ring was buried down in the tube where the hair used to grow. The professor says the hairs he sewed in will be there when Peggie is 2,000 years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do We Have Too Much Food?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">S</span><span class="font4">AYS George A. Nelson, of Wisconsin, in a booklet put out by the Socialist party:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The AAA has proceeded on the grounds that since production and consumption are out of balance, balance must be restored by stopping production and reducing the living standards for all. At the same time another branch of the government, making a study of PWA funds, has been finding out how much food the 125,000,000 residents of the U. S. would consume if they ate as much as the Department of Agriculture says they should in order to keep in good health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study shows that with the good crops of 1929 we had plenty of grain, potatoes, bacon and lard in that year, but we have been short over three billion gallons of milk, and short over a billion dozen of eggs. We have only a little over half enough green vegetables, only half enough butter, and would have had a shortage of nearly two billion pounds of meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If every man had been able to buy one suit of clothes every two years, we would have had to import cotton and wool. Since in 1929 there were forty-six million people who had incomes of less than $426, they could not be expected to maintain a decent standard of living and have an egg for breakfast, half a pound of meat and a pint and a half of milk every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the face of these facts, the AAA program called for reductions during 1934 of 20 percent in com, 25 percent in hogs, 40 percent in cotton, and 15 percent in wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such a program will work only when and if the American people are willing to live on a much lower standard than they have ever known before. Subsistence farming and living on relief is a program for a defeated nation, without hope for the future. Already our conservatives are talking of depriving the millions of unemployed workers and destitute ex-farmers of their right to vote. This is the way Rome created a slave class from its own people. There are better ways out of our present problems than this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the height of absurdity to talk of there being too much in this country, even in so-called “prosperous” times. There are millions of people who have never seen an orange or had milk to drink since they were babies. Share-croppers in the south get fresh meat two or three times a year, in good years. Lettuce, tomatoes, celery, and other fresh vegetables are absolutely unheard of in thousands of mill towns and in some farm regions. Sow belly and beans is a lot nearer the American idea of a good meal than most people like to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Brain Trusters seem to think that everybody starts out the day with grapefruit, bacon and eggs, toast and coffee, just because they do. What this country needs is a farm program that will enable workers to buy everything the farmers now produce and holler for more, a program based on plenty and not scarcity. This is America, not China, and President Roosevelt needs to do some more traveling before announcing again that there is enough for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not these things prove conclusively- that the politicians in power do not know anything about the farmers’ problems? If they don’t know, how can they help us?</span></p>

We are not running a rattery, neither are we running a piggery. We are teaching humans how to live to get the most out of life, and how to conserve their health through wholesome living. In other words, teaching humans how to retain health, or how to regain health. Thousands of persons have written me, telling of their recovery from all manner of unhealth, simply by throwing all aluminum-ware out of the house. Clinical findings we must go by. Practically all laboratories can be hired to give findings to suit the case. The more capital there is back of any product, the better the ‘laboratory findings’ usually are. Some animals can eat strychnine and not become poisoned by it. Some can eat tobacco and not die from its poisonous effect. Some can eat food cooked in aluminum and not get rheumatism, or ulcers, or cancer from it. Why take chances?”</span></p>

He admitted, to start with, that there is such a thing as aluminum poisoning, and then said, “Careful research has shown that ordinary foods cooked in aluminum dishes cannot and do not dissolve enough aluminum to cause poisoning”; and this in face of the fact that sometimes as many as three hundred to a thousand persons have keeled over at one time because of that very thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Business of Not Raising Bogs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">T SEEMS that one of the best-paying businesses in the country is that of not raising hogs. At Poplar Bluff, Mo., in June, a farmer received 18c for 670 pounds of hogs; the rest went for yardage, insurance, commission and drayage. In Kansas City, Mo., in August, 44 pigs were sold at $1.75 per dozen, and two days later, in Harper, Kans., two 80-pound pigs would have brought their owner 96 cents, but inspection charges, yardage and selling cost him 81 cents, and when he took his 15c check to the bank that businesslike and humane institution charged him 10c for cashing it; so the total he got for two pigs was 5e. On the other side of the story is the money that is paid out by the government for not raising hogs. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Financial Chronicle,</span><span class="font4"> of New York city, has the following: </span><span class="font3">“A friend of mine in New England has a neighbor who has received a government cheek for $1,000 this year for not raising hogs. So my friend now wants to go into the business himself, he not being very prosperous just now; he says, in fact, that the idea of not raising hogs appeals to him very strongly. Of course, he will need a hired man, and that is where I come in. I write to you as to your opinion of the best kind of a farm not to raise hogs on, the best strain of hogs not to raise, and how best to keep an inventory of hogs you are not raising. Also, do you think capital could be raised by issuance of a non-hog raising gold bond? The friend who got the $1,000 got it for not raising 500 hogs. Now we figure we might easily not raise 1,500 to 2,000 hogs, so you see the possible profits are only limited by the number of hogs we do not raise. The other fellow had been raising hogs for 40 years and never made more than $400 in any one year. Kind of pathetic, isn’t it, to think how he wasted his life raising hogs when he could have made so much more not raising them! I thank you for any advice you may offer.”</span></p>

Should the farmer skin a beef he can sell the hide at an average of $1.09. One woman pleaded with the men shooting down good milk cows to please give her one, as her children had not had a drop of milk all summer; they replied that she would raise a calf or two if they did, and increase production, and that is what the Government wants to stop. They pulled the trigger, shot down a nice cow and said to her, ‘You go home and get you a knife, skin her and take home as much meat as you like, and if you won’t wish to do that, why let it rot.’ ”</span></p>

They do not have to take into consideration the money expended to hire lawyers that they do not need—invariably the sons, relatives, or law partners of men in responsible offices, and in ‘ rare instances ’ the officials themselves. Their services are very valuable and often very expensive. Then there is a swarm of power lobbyists in and around Washington, as well as around every state legislature.

To prevent other young people from getting similarly stung by the Paul Rader outfit she describes in detail how this gang that boasted that it raised over $100,000 a year set her on a platform in Chicago and used her as bait to wring money out of the audience, but, thereafter, after hustling her off to Africa, far from civilization, from September of one year to October of the next, let her stay in the heart of Africa with only $10 for her support. This faithful and trusting young woman lived on white ants and locusts while Rader and his religious frauds disposed of the $100,000. Miss Reinhart reports that many missionaries thus inveigled into the work die or become insane; she had a good constitution and pluck and made her way across Africa, where, at length, she got word to her mother. That faithful soul mortgaged her home and sent her $500 for her return passage. The letters that Miss Reinhart received from these missionary frauds while she was in Africa would be a disgrace to the Devil. They were strong on telling her they were praying for her, but she had to depend on the Africans to keep her from starving. She declares that the female savages of Africa have more of real Christianity in their make-up than the persons who got her into the mission field; and, without a doubt, she is correct. Rader and his gang almost drove this woman out of the United States, in seeming haste to get her into the mission field. They would not allow her time to go home to see her folks. On this point Miss Reinhart says: “Only now do I realize that all this rush and hurry were just part of the racket. We were rushed off our feet for two reasons: to keep us from changing our minds, and to serve as sacrificial lambs in a calculated scheme of money raising.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">On this basis Yaxley says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Am enclosing another gem of sparkling light emanating from one of the bright minds of our modern liberal age. This pearl of “wisdom” proceeded from a Dr. Craig, teacher of theology at Oberlin College. He charges that Jesus was interested in religion to the exclusion of other important matters. After reading the 23d chapter of Matthew I think the religionists of His day would have been glad if Jesus had not been interested in religion at all. But because He was chiefly interested in the honor of His Father’s holy name, and the Devil’s religionists in dishonoring that name, He did interest himself sufficiently in the matter to show those religionists where they got off. (John 8:44) Note the further accusation, that Jesus was an unbalanced personality. Why, then, does this ‘ ‘ doctor ’ who doubtless would call himself a Christian, follow (or profess to follow) the teachings of one whom he considers his mental inferior? ‘He who honors not the Son dishonors God, who sent Him.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">S</span><span class="font4">AYS L. H. Strege, of North Dakota: “The Lutheran churches out here started a new deal; they leave small banks at each home, and each one in the family, before each meal, must drop one cent into the bank to keep up the church. Someone told me that even that was getting hard to do.” Of course it was getting hard to do. Roughly, it is $50 a year for an average family, and the real good that the family would get would be 50c, at the outside.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font4"> says that three children were discussing the incomes of their fathers. One said: “My father writes a song in the evening and sells it for $25.” The next countered: “My father writes a story in an evening and takes it down town the next morning and sells it for $50.” “That’s nothing,” declared the third, “my father gets up in a pulpit on Sunday and talks for half an hour and it takes twelve men to carry the money up to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SEVENTEENTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Herewith we present the seventeenth in the series of eighteen short Bible talks by Judge Rutherford. These talks are intended to clarify important Biblical questions, and have been greatly appreciated by earnest seekers for the Truth. In his straightforward presentation of the facts Judge Rutherford not only points out the right view, but also clearly shows why certain views are wrong. In this way the reader gets a clear conception of the point at issue and is in a position to fortify himself against misconceptions that tend to confuse the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sanctification</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">O BE wholly devoted to God and His kingdom means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sanctification.</span><span class="font4"> When a person believes on the Lord Jesus Christ as the redeemer whom God has provided for man, and agrees to follow in the footsteps of Jesus by doing the will of God, he thereby makes a consecration. If the person who makes a consecration to do the will of God then faithfully carries out that agreement he must become sanctified. How can he become sanctified?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Church organizations teach that one, to be sanctified, must have some kind of ceremony performed for him by a clergyman or preacher in the meeting house or church building. That is not the way the Scriptures say that sanctification is accomplished. The faithful apostles of Jesus had consecrated themselves to do the will of God and had followed Jesus for more than three years. Jesus had said to them: “Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God.” At the time He spoke to them the mystery was not revealed to them. He told them that after He had ascended into heaven unto His Father they would receive the holy spirit and then understand. Just before His departure He prayed to Jehovah concerning these faithful disciples, using these words (John 17:17, 18): “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” Clearly these words mean that the disciples must know the truth and devote themselves wholly to the truth in order to be sanctified. That same rule applies to all who believe on Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To participate in some formal ceremony performed by men could have nothing to do towards sanctifying you. According to the announced rule you must learn the truth as contained in the Bible and then devote yourself to telling others about the truth. That means that you have taken your stand on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom, that you believe in and recognize Christ Jesus as the Savior of the world, and God’s appointed King, and that His kingdom is the only hope for the people. If you truly believe this you cannot fail to tell others about it. Your proclaiming this message to others will offend all who are teachers of error, such as the clergy, but you must not be disturbed by reason of that. You cannot be a man-pleaser and at the same time please God. All men who love and serve Jehovah God will be pleased because you tell the truth, but those who are under the control of Satan, the god of this wicked world, will be offended and will say all manner of evil things against you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the one who has made a consecration these words of instruction are given in the Scriptures: ‘Study to show yourselves approved unto God, and sanctify yourselves, and make yourselves meet for the Master’s use.’ (2 Timothy 2:15) The work of the great Master, Christ Jesus, is to vindicate Jehovah’s name; and to be meet for His use you must be a witness in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. You must shun vain babbling or doctrines of men and learn and obey the truth of God’s Word. No one can gain the truth for you, but you must acquire it for yourself by carefully studying the truth as set forth in the Bible. By the grace of God books are provided in these days of great need to enable the people to find in the Bible these truths and to learn how to understand them. That is the reason for many books’ now going into the hands of the people. Every question that today arises concerning the sickness, suffering, oppression, woe and distress upon the earth is completely answered in the Scriptures. The only means of relief for the people, their uplifting and blessing, is also stated in the Scriptures. At once it becomes apparent that a knowledge and under-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">standing of God’s Word not only is necessary but is the only means of sanctification. Learn His truth, obey His commandments, and you will rejoice. The man who finds understanding and wisdom is he who learns and obeys the Word of God. To such Jehovah graciously says (Proverbs 3:13-18): “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding: for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her.”</span></p>

When you part with your collateral you can specify that you desire either a speedy entrance into heaven, or a happy death, or blessings on your home, or business, or farm, or cattle. The album is put under the altar, to tip the Lord off to the fact that “Reverend” Cain has got your $25 and that it is up to Him to carry out His end of the bribery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">B</span><span class="font4">Y SENDING 25c a name you can get your name and your friends’ names written in a book at the Office of the Provincial, 2222 West Market Street, Louisville, Kentucky, and as soon as the book is full it will be presented “at the crib of the Divine Infant on Christmas Eve”. We understand that the Provincial, “Fr.” Aloys, O.M.C., keeps the money. Unless they have the loose-leaf system, about the most names anybody could write in the book in a day would be 1,000, which at 25c apiece would be only $250 for a full day’s ■work, but with the loose-leaf system this could be multiplied indefinitely. But even if the loose-leaf system is not used, it is probable that the ‘Divine Infant in the crib’ would not put up any special uproar if more than one book of names were placed near the crib. Considering these hard times, this looks like quite a good enterprise.</span></p>

Historians tell us that John XI was the son of Marozia to Pope Sergius III (904-911). When John XI became pope, Marpzia then poisoned her husband and became the mistress of her own son. Shortly after, Alberic, another son, imprisoned his brother the pope, and became the paramour of his mother. From this criminal intercourse sprang a child who afterwards became Pope John XII, in 955. Pope John XII was not only the son of Alberic but also his brother. Marozia was not only his mother but also his grandmother. Can you beat that?”</span></p>

However, if you are thinking of digging up for one of these cords, you can get a prayer to the cord free of charge. The prayer contains 66 words and for saying it once a day and adding to it seven times Gloria Patri you get 100 days indulgence; and if that isn’t something, what is? Moreover, by a decree of Pius IX there is a plenary indulgence for those who die while wearing one of these cords.

Not sure if they were men or women, but as they had apparently backed into their stiff white collars, they were probably wearing the nice, pretty lace only because they liked the feel of it, and were probably masculine persons in disguise. Another thing that suggests it is that their bonnets were not as stylish and cute as they might have been, their faces would stop a clock, and in a few instances, where bonnets were missing, there was some indication that the domes above the collars were poorly thatched. A bird without feathers makes a mighty poor-looking bird.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N TALKING it over at Vatican City with the bishop of Springfield, Ill., Ambrose said, “A more equitable distribution of the world’s wealth is the Catholic idea.” What he means was illustrated in St. Louis recently, where a wealthy woman left something like $2,000,000 to the ‘church’ and about $10,000 to her needy relatives. Had she made “a more equitable distribution” of her wealth she would have forked the whole estate over to the ‘church’, as thousands have done, and been coaxed to do, and the relatives could have been put on relief and fed by the taxes wrung from the poor suckers who do not understand how to distribute wealth when they get it</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Remonstrance to Keokuk Chief of Police</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Dubuque </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leader</span><span class="font4"> contains the letter of F. W. Mahlke, of that city, addressed to the chief of police, Keokuk, Iowa, respecting the arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses which occurred in that city last summer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir : Your letter received and contents noted. In reply will state that I have no intentions to enter any controversies with you whatever, but I believe you were led to make last Sunday’s blunder through a lack of knowledge of facts relative to what Jehovah’s witnesses were endeavoring to accomplish in your fine city. Permit me to say that this witness work is universal and this preaching of the gospel of Christ’s kingdom is printed in more than fifty different languages and does not involve the slightest commercialism or the getting of a few pennies by street-hawking or peddling which your city ordinance on peddling covers. It is the same gospel that Jesus Christ preached, that the kingdom of God is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you had given the matter careful thought you would have realized that when more than one hundred fifty people come several hundred miles, at their own expense for gas and food, the small contribution any resident of Keokuk might voluntarily offer for such priceless books or booklets would be microscopie compared with the valuable vital information and knowledge contained in this literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through the action of your department you permitted the impression to be spread throughout the United States, by a biased press, that more than one hundred and fifty criminals infested your city and that every householder was in danger of having something pilfered. Now you know the truth of the matter was that kind, meek, gentle-hearted men and women with the love of Christ in their hearts were endeavoring to enlighten the minds of your citizens that have been kept in darkness through superstition and fear in the nominal systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You state, “The clergy had nothing to do with the arrest of these people.’’ In the next paragraph you state you “assisted in the arrests that were made after we received numerous complaints from our citizens’’. I grant you the benefit of a doubt, but in doing what you thought your duty you placed yourself “between the Devil and the deep blue sea”. The very fact that numerous complaints came pouring in over the phones from all parts of the city and almost simultaneously is proof positive that someone or several people incited your citizens to call your headquarters. It certainly has all the earmarks of the usual methods employed by the clergy. If one or two isolated calls had been made it would have been a passing incident, but you let the cat out of the bag by emphasizing the fact that “numerous calls were made”, which very clearly indicated that a premeditated concerted action had been carefully launched to ridicule and persecute honest and earnest respectable men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, Mr. McPherson, I want you to observe the whole matter without prejudice or bias of any kind. Is it not strange that, with thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses working from coast to coast, going from door to door, preaching the gospel of good news that Christ’s kingdom is in the process of being established, they go unmolested except in a few places like Keokuk, where the clergy still seem to have the upper hand? These visitations by Jehovah’s witnesses have been made time and time again to such towns as Rockford, Ill., LaCrosse, Wis., Waterloo, Iowa, Davenport, Iowa, Burlington, Muscatine and Fort Madison, Iowa, just to mention a few good-sized cities, and no one was molested. On the contrary, all were given a hand of welcome, because everyone knows that what this sick world needs more than anything else is more of the holy Bible, Jehovah. God’s inspired Book. Other cities offer police protection rather than to incarcerate big-hearted, loving Christians. Police chiefs have said, “The city is yours”; “May every success attend your efforts”; “God bless you in your work”; and other friendly remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You have no excuse for the outrageous treatment offered last Sunday. Before any of the workers went to a single home a paper explaining what was being done and a list of the names of the workers were left at your office on your desk by your assistant to whom everything had been fully explained as to what kind of a mission these people were on. You should have known that these people do this work without any recompense or profit. You should have known that a small contribution of five cents could not cover the cost of printing or production and distribution, saying nothing of the expense of coming to your city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, you permitted your department to become an agency of suppression of Bible truth, using the weak excuse of violating a city ordinance which can in no sense of the word cover the preaching of the gospel according to the Constitution of the United States. Several hundred of the booklets were given gratis where no contribution was offered. Does this look like peddling? This door-to-door visitation is not selling, but an educational work, purely philanthropic and altruistic in every sense of the word, and is so recognized by all right-minded people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the crowds at the jail many Masons and other fraternally minded Keokuk citizens voiced their disapproval of the high-handed methods employed, and voluntarily offered money and influence to right the injustice. One Keokuk citizen, Dr. Wedel, made the offer in your office to sign bonds for the release of all arrested. Another Keokuk citizen offered to advance $1,000.00 to be used to liberate Jehovah God’s faithful ones. These sympathetic Keokuk citizens were all strangers to Jehovah’s witnesses and were ashamed of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">what had occurred. But Jehovah’s witnesses rely on no men, but stand on their constitutional rights, with faith in the Supreme One above. Are they contumacious? Not a bit. Being law-abiding and determined to do their duty by preaching the gospel by the printed page, thereby sacrificing time, energy and money because they love their fellow man, they cannot be stopped by threats of future arrests. They have no fear of what man might do to them, but they must obey what Jehovah God wants them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In your sixth paragraph you complain of the methods used by Jehovah’s witnesses. You state “all were sorry for these people”. You do not specify nor clearly state how these methods are unlawful or remiss in any way. You deal in generalities. Honestly, now, you cannot truthfully state that any of these people looked like convicts or jail birds, can you? If the methods employed were criminal, why were these good people released? You state in the same paragraph that if the same methods are employed again, these people will probably again be arrested “and will not get off so easily”. I do not wish to think you mean to insinuate a threat, but none of Jehovah’s witnesses desire to violate any laws, but are polite, kind-hearted, God-fearing people, and when imposed upon and insulted offer no resistance but sing songs to Jehovah’s praise, considering it a privilege to go to jail rather than to be cowardly and deny their Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You state in the last paragraph of your letter that you do not belong to or attend any church. I congratulate you on your good sense in this respect. But do not make the mistake by thinking that Jehovah’s witnesses’ work is just another silly creed or new religion. It is merely Bible education explaining what is in store for all of mankind in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You also state how fair you have been to all creeds. You may not know it, but all the creeds are being relegated to the ash can and people all over the world refuse to be any longer flimflammed by man-made dogma and doctrines, but want the Bible truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I thank you for your kind welcome asking our return to Keokuk. However, you qualify the invitation to your city by saying we are welcome if we obey your laws. You know now that we have not disobeyed any of your laws; and so far as peddling licenses are concerned, your city ordinance in this respect does no more apply to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses than it would to preachers or priests who take contributions on Sundays in collection plates and not even give the contributor a book or booklet to take home for further instruction and information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you will permit me to suggest it, I think you should procure the entire set of our Bible helps and study them. You will learn what it is all about, and surely will be well repaid for your time spent. Then when narrow-minded bigots and religious fanatics come to you demanding you to exercise your authority to jail mothers and fathers of good, respectable families and even take innocent children, like last Sunday, you can do your duty by showing them that they lack tolerance and a Christlike spirit. With, a knowledge of what these books contain you will be well qualified to show the hypocrites and bigots the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(standing near car).</span><span class="font4"> That’s true; every word of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Here’s a booklet, stranger. Can you contribute a nickel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. Sure!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. There’s Scottdale over there, Joe. Looks like a pretty nice spot, over on that hill, to set up after we leave here. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(To stranger)</span><span class="font4"> How do we get to that hill over yonder ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. Pull up to center of town and turn left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Boy! what a swell site! We’ll turn two horns over this way and swing the other two over that section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. O.K. Let them have it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(In a few minutes)</span><span class="font4"> Well, they are getting it Look at them come out! They ought to, we are only half a mile away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Next day, by party who witnessed in Scottdale.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(after knocking at door).</span><span class="font4"> Will you kindly read this card, Madam?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. Sure.... Why, I heard Judge Rutherford yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(not knowing sound car was in the vicinity the day previous).</span><span class="font4"> Is that so? Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. I don’t know. I just heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(at next house).</span><span class="font4"> “I have here an important message. Will you kindly read it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. Certainly.... Why, I heard the judge yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K. Where was it coming from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K. That’s funny. He was not on the air, that I know of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">K </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(meeting partner).</span><span class="font4"> Say, they all seem to have heard Judge Rutherford yesterday. How come? I wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Partner. They had the sound car out here. One person said she saw them ’way up on that hill. She said she heard every word of it. Boy! that’s something, isn’t it? It shows how few the Lord could get along with, if necessary. Think of it! all these people hearing the message, and only two with the car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Back to the car.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Where to now, Tom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. To Vanderbilt. It’s about seven miles from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(At Vanderbilt.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Well, here we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. It lies in a nice valley, doesn’t it? It should resound here. Let’s pull up here. Appears that the road ends abruptly.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Five Days with the Sound Car</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">om. Joe, how about going out with the sound car all next week?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. How about starting Wednesday?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Fine! We shall ask Lester to arrange an itinerary for us. Where to, Lester ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lester. Here is a map. Take this highway, beginning here, and cover it to this point, then west to this point; circle around these few towns and come back north to this point, and then make a wide circle and cover what you can in </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font4">s direction. You have an outline of what you should cover, and can work it to suit circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. O.K. Will meet you at ten o’clock Wednesday morning, Joe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wednesday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Good morning, Joe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Hello, Tom. Sure a fine morning, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Certainly is. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Car proceeds to assigned territory.)</span><span class="font4"> Look there, Joe! But no; Lester said that town had it. Let’s start at the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Well, there she is in the distance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(After a few minutes’ drive.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Here we are; Star Junction. Looks like a town of about 500. There is a pretty good spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. I think we’ll pull up to the other side.... Here we are. Looks pretty good from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. O.K. We can turn all four horns in a semicircle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Music, &quot;Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life.’’)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Look at them come out, Joe! What are you going to give them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. “Kingdom Blessings for the People.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(through the microphone when music has ended).</span><span class="font4">“To the people of Star Junction: What you are about to hear is not man’s idea, nor does the speaker, Judge Rutherford, claim it as his message. He is merely doing his part as one of Jehovah’s witnesses in bringing this message to you ...” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Then the lecture. Many people stand in their tracks, listening to the end, and many come out and sit on their porches, listening to the message.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Now, Joe, on to Everson. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Uponarrival) </span><span class="font4">Here we are. Let’s turn here. Looks like a hill up there. Wonder in what direction the wind is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. There doesn’t appear to be much wind. I think I’ll pull up here. This takes us to the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Go slow, Joe. Looks as if they’re fixing the road. Go slow over these sharp stones. That’s fine.... Well, here we are, all set up; let them have it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The lecture proceeds.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Lady, may we go to the top of this hill through this gate and put on a program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. Surely. Go right up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(At top of hill.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Horns O.K., Tom. Let them have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Lecture proceeds.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. Boy! He knows how to tell them, doesn’t he? I believe every word of it. See that fellow with the white trousers. Notice how closely he is examining your outfit. He is an electrical expert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Electrician. You boys have some sweet job here. I have never seen anything just like it before, and I have seen many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(At Leisenring, a mining town.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. One can see it’s a priest-ridden town. Nothing but poverty. Let’s pull up here. This looks pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Look, Tom! There’s a Catholic church. Let’s put two horns over there and two on the town. They are all there in a group. O.K., Tom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. O.K.... Look, Joe! Look at the priest scurrying up the steps. He just came out from among those trees. Look; he runs up two steps and then looks, and then two more, and looks. Reminds me of how we used to jump rabbits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. He might just as well stay where he is; he can’t get away from this. He can’t shut this off as he can the radio. Say, look at the crowd coming! My! They are coming in swarms. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Fifteen minutes later.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Say, Joe, did you ever see a crowd sitting around in such a uniform manner? Nothing but a clay bank, but it looks more like a stadium, the way they are sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Yes, but some of those younger kids look mischievous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Well, there’s the end.... Everything O.K., Joe, hop in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Joe looks back and sees boy putting something under the wheel. Jumps out, with threatening look in his eye, and warns boy. As we reached the bottom of the hill some rocks came perilously near.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Only the Lord helped us to get out of that jam. Well, I guess we’d better go back to Brother J’s and get our supper, so as to be in Connellsville in time to put on a couple of programs before it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(After supper.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. I can show you boys a place where you can get both this end of town and a suburb with one blast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Fine, let’s have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Eight o’clock, in another location.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. Now here is a good setup for this end of town. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Horns are directed as suggested, when)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. All set, Tom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Yep, let her go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(With first sound the people of both sections come out like flies.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(after listening a while).</span><span class="font4"> Whom do you represent? Do the clergy support this work? It must cost a lot of money to build a car like that ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The work is explained to him and a few other professional-looking men standing near. Meanwhile</span><span class="font4"> R </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">comes running up.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">R. Say, the minute I got off the train I heard the judge’s voice. You can hear it all over the place down there. I didn’t know you were in town. I traced the voice, and here I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. There is something wrong with the mike, Tom. Your announcement did not go over well. Shake the mike a little. I think there must be a loose connection. Well, we have only one more town, and if it does not work we’ll fix it this evening when we get home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(At J’s home that evening.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Do you know of a good radio man in town, Brother J? We should like to get the mike looked after, but we don’t want anyone to hold us up. If we were nearer home we could get one of our boys to look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. Come to think of it, Brother A works for the Bell Telephone Company in town. He is an expert. I will call him up. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Phones.)</span><span class="font4"> He said you can call at the office at eight o’clock tomorrow morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thursday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom and Joe. Good morning!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A. Good morning, boys; what can I do for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. We should like you to test our mike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Half an hour later.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font4">Here you are; try it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(at car, parked on Main street, after connecting microphone).</span><span class="font4"> One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four; keep in line, you rookies; hip, hip, hip, hip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. That’s enough, Tom. It must be working. Look at the men running up here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(A Jewish cobbler runs out of his shop and up to the car, all aghast.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cobbler. I thought the whole army was coming down the street. Say, that’s a swell outfit you’ve got! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Reading sign on car)</span><span class="font4"> “Jehovah’s witnesses, Pittsburgh Division.” It must be an army, after all, since you designate yourselves a “division”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(On way to territory, after driving an hour.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. There’s Somerset. Quite a big town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Yes, it will take a couple of blasts here. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Just as the lecture ends a man pulls up in a car and shows his badge.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Offices. You are disturbing the court down there and will have to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Are you an officer of the law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Officer. No, a court attache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Well, we will stop. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Officer’s chest swells up as he draws away thinking that he has gotten rid of these “locusts”.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Joe, I thought we would let him think he bluffed us. I want to see that chest go down. We don’t want to be so close as to disturb the court; so let’s find a place where we can get it over here in a way that the people can get it, and not disturb the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. It seems that the judge outside is interfering with the judge inside. Well, the Lord didn’t say we should go out with this sound car and, if court is in session, go back home. So we will get out of town and find a place to send it over. There’s a good spot over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(At another point.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Well, here we are. Boy! what a site! All ready, Tom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Tom walks about half a mile toivard the toicn while the lecture is in progress, and returns.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Joe, it is hitting over there like a machine gun. Can you imagine that officer’s chest go down when he heard the first strain of “Sweet Mystery of Life”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Lecture nears completion. A woman approaches all out of breath, after half running almost a mile. Either her husband is after her or she is heading for us.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Woman. “Where the carcass is, there are the eagles gathered together!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Then you are one of us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Woman. Yes, I am Sister W; and is it coming in down there! I was near the school, just a block from the courthouse, when the judge’s voice came over. A man was passing me at the time, and we both stopped. “What is that?” he said. ‘It sounds like Moses’ voice”; and with that I started, and here I am. Come over, and I will prepare dinner for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Since you have not started dinner yet, </span><span class="font4">we will go over to the other side and give them </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">blast, and then we will come in for lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Later, at Somerfield.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Well, here is Somerfield, Joe. A nice little town. Let’s stop here before we go into it. Won’t it smack against that ridge over there, though! Let them have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Lecture almost through when young lady approaches on the run.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady. I am Brother M’s niece, Sister S. Every word is coming in clear down there in the valley; clearer than it is up here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(After supper. At Connellsville. First lecture in progress.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. That sure is a nifty outfit you have there. What are you advertising?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. We need it. What kind of mike is that, a “G.E.”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Oh, no. It’s a “J.w.”, and that beats a “G.E.” any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Onto final lecture for the second day out. Wind up at 9:45, tired, and, to bed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Friday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A beautiful spot overlooking downtown Connellsville ; and a more beautiful sight, overlooking a nice big building with a cross on it and a beautiful parish house beside it. Music begins. Two nuns bring the children out and line them up facing the hill on which the sound car is located. The lecture comes on and a priest comes out and turns his ear into the wind. The nuns go over to confer with him but do not seem to arrive at a decision, so the children stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another setup at Villa, then on to Dunbar. At a beautiful spot just half a mile from the edge of town a man gives permission to locate on a knoll near his house. Tom starts program and walks almost into the town. The nearer to the town, the clearer the judge’s voice becomes. People on mountainside a mile away are out on the porches, looking and listening. As the lecture nears completion a car approaches from Dunbar and stops. The occupants jump out and almost stumble over themselves to get to us. It is a carload of Jehovah’s witnesses from Brownsville. We didn’t know they were there, and they didn’t know we were around, until the lecture began. They locate the sound car, and everybody is happy. On their way back they make arrangements for us to have our supper at Uniontown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the next town, Mt. Braddock, we pass through town and up a hill into a yard where a lady graciously permits us to set up. At the first blast everybody on Main street halts and looks up. Men come out of doors and sit with pipe in mouth. Women come out wiping hands upon their aprons and sit down to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next town is Lemont Furnace. Here Tom stays in town to listen while the car proceeds up a slope to a point near the schoolhouse. It is recess time. The music begins and teachers and pupils surround the car. Tom, from the hill opposite the town, can hardly see the car for school children. The dresses of the school girls add color and make the scene a beautiful one. The judge’s voice comes over, but the wind is strong, blowing it away at a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tom descends the hill to the town nestling in the valley. No wind down there. He winds in and out through the streets and alleys, but just can’t get away from that voice. It is clear and distinct wherever he goes. People on their porches, business men at their doors, stand and listen. “It is marvelous in our eyes.” On to Oliver, and then to the Government camp for unemployed men. These say, “It is simply great. Come back again. We are sick of those preachers they send out here every Sunday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Saturday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Washington, Pa., we pass through the outskirts, on to Amity, and set up on the main road leading into town. As the music comes on people from both sides of main street run out into the street, and collect in groups to listen. Then to Waynesburg. Sister S prepares dinner while sound car sets up in suburbs. It is a “Holy Roller” town. People roll out. Several climb roof of abandoned factory and sit and listen till lecture is finished. After lunch, on to Sycamore, a sleepy little town which suddenly becomes very much alive. It hasn’t been aroused so much since Morgan’s Raiders were headed its way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then to Nineveh, Graysville, Wind Ridge. Wind Ridge is a beautiful little town situated on top of a 1500-foot hill, the very knoll of the hill where we set up being slightly higher than the town itself. They must have thought it was the angel Gabriel, so many swarmed out into the street. Then to Rogersville, and to Waynesburg again for one setup and an early supper, so as to get an early start for Morgantown that evening. We arrive at Sr. S’s, who suggests that we see the burgess and get permission to set up at the band concert which is held every Saturday night in that town in front of the courthouse. We interviewed the burgess, who is a fine man. Although a strict Catholic, he said he had heard every word of the lectures, “Jehovah,” “Rebellion,” “Armageddon,” an hour previously, but hesitated because he did not know how the people would take to such a program. We were finally able to gain his consent, and were taken to the station house and introduced to the policemen, so they would know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then to Morrisville to put one on there before the one at the band concert. Covered Morrisville with two horns, swinging the other two over Waynesburg, which was a few miles to the west. Needed only two horns where we were, so thought we would get what we could of this side of Waynesburg. After the lecture in the very center of Waynesburg, for the benefit of the concert crowd, a lady living a block away said she heard the lecture just as plainly from Morrisville. Our setup in Waynesburg for this occasion was in a park two blocks from the courthouse. Had we set up at that point, traffic would have been blocked. We could see the people as they came to the main intersection and look our way. It came in there well, for Tom had gone there to get the correct amount of power on, so as not to have it too loud. The people had to keep moving, however, as the streets were crowded, but they all got some of it. Couldn’t get away from it. That name “Jehovah” struck that old intersection and the crowd at the concert more than in all the years that preceded this occasion. Only the Lord himself knows the results. Then, home and to bed, tired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sunday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rose 'bright and early. A beautiful Sunday morning. Ate a hearty breakfast and headed south. First stop, Mt. Morris.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. There’s a nice spot, Joe, across the creek and upon that knoll. It overlooks a beautiful little stream, clear and pure, and also the town, as quiet as a little town nestled in the hills could be. How does this look, Joe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Fine. Swing those two horns around a bit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(&quot;Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life” hits the town and the distant hills and echoes back. The echo is nearly as plain as the original. People come out and stand listening to the music, but with beginning of the lecture some sit down and make themselves comfortable.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(On to Morgantown, where, up a road overlooking the river and the town from Westover, the entire business section and the university lie before us. One blast and everyone stops. A crowd collects on the bridge on the other side and there are a half dozen men sitting on a porch roof. Some are standing on the campus, a mile to the northeast. The program continues.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. Say, I can take you fellows to a place where you can get the whole business without moving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom and Joe. O.K. That’s fine. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Lecture ends. Stranger squeezes into car with us, and up, up, up, over another road, and up, up, up, until Reservoir HUI, the pinnacle of the mountain, is reached, and there before us is a panorama to behold.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stranger. There is Morgantown; you can see practically every house in it. There is another town over there to the south, and over there to the north still another. In fact, you are looking at the entire county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Joe, it looks like a long way over there. I wonder if it will reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. I don’t know. All we can do is give it to them, and how!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(In a home four miles from Reservoir Hill.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. T. “Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life!” Isn’t that beautiful! An organ solo. Clara, tune in and see where that is coming from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Clara </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(turns dial of radio).</span><span class="font4"> That’s funny; I can’t get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. T. Isn’t that sweet! Seems to be coming right up from out of the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Then the judge’s voice; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. T </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stated she did not know from what source it was coming until the announcement after the lecture, and then had no realization that she was listening in to something that had its source four miles from her home. She claims to have heard every word of the lecture.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(On Reservoir Hill)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Joe, let’s have those field glasses. There should be more people out down there if there weren’t a sound car around. Such a beautiful morning! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Adjusts glasses and looks.)</span><span class="font4"> See that house up there, Joe? that one on the very top; the one farthest from here? I can see them standing on the porch and looking. They must be getting it there. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Looks at watch.)</span><span class="font4"> I’ve got it! It’s church time! That’s where they are, and boy! is it hitting in there, Joe! It’s not hitting hard enough to disturb them, but, can you iriiagine? it’s going through the open windows of those churches down there- just enough to tickle the ears of the “prisoners” and to the discomfiture of the ‘prison keeper’. And they can’t turn it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Well, good-bye, Morgantown and vicinity. It is almost beyond comprehension, isn’t it, Tom? that within one hour the Lord’s message was carried over this entire country. And into the “prison houses” also; a place where it could go in no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. That’s true, Joe, and no doubt it will cause many people to give more heed to the message when we go from door to door. Well, we must hurry, as we want to give the works to —let’s look at the map. There are four more towns yet to do, and that will complete our five days of blessedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(After completion of towns)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Let’s look at your logbook, Joe. Well! It shows that we worked thirty-six towns, some of them necessitating as many as four setups. Your estimate of hearers is conservative, approximating 57,000. And we put in an average of almost eleven hours per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joe. Didn’t the time go fast! Small wonder the Bible says that with the Lord “a thousand years” is “as one day”. When one is busy the time passes so quickly. Well, here’s your home, Tom. Good-bye! I’ll see you later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tom. Good-bye, Joe. We will plan another trip soon. _________________</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wipe Out Tyranny</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">T THE recent San Francisco Convention of the American Federation of Labor, President Wm. Green said: “The A. F. of L. has no creed, no race, no nationality. It is our hope to unite the entire world into an international brotherhood. We must continue this boycott [of German goods] until the tyrannical governments of Germany and Italy are wiped out. So far as it is within my power I shall do everything possible to make the boycott effective until the liberty and freedom are restored to the workers of Germany and they are allowed to work and live in peace.” There was only one dissenting vote to the resolution to continue the boycott. Evidently the delegates to the convention were not convinced that the present conditions in Germany really express the will of the German people. The only power, however, that can wipe out tyrannical governments is the supreme power of Jehovah God; and He will accomplish that very thing in the great battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Feast of the Sun and “the Mass of Christ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">T IS over once again, the time of “the mass of Christ”, formerly observed as the “feast of the sun” and identified with the birthday of Nimrod, the wicked founder of Babylon. It is a time when there is supposed to be much graciousness abroad, when otherwise surly and cussed people blossom forth into benevolence and sweetness. It is a time when there is singing of carols, and jazz. It is a time when stomachs are stuffed beyond the limits designed for that much-used organ. It is a time when the poor, or some of them, forgotten throughout the year, receive baskets of food and other supplies. It is the time when in great cathedrals and temples and smaller places of worship “mass is sung” and the people look at little babies in cribs, and perhaps kiss an old board, which is claimed to have been part of the original “cradle” in which Christ supposedly slept in His Nazareth home. (Cradles were unknown until A.D. 1140.) It is a time when “gifts” are “exchanged”, as an evidence of love, sentiment and unselfishness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Christmas” is a sweeping and all-inclusive holiday. Gentile and Jew, sinner and saint, believer and infidel, Christian and anti-Christian, have all to some degree and in some fashion bowed, whether sincerely or obsequiously, ignorantly or with understanding, at this shrine of hoary antiquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be apparent to everyone who does any thinking at all that merely attaching the name of Christ to anything does not make it either holy or desirable. Nor does such a practice honor either the Father or the Son, but is more likely to show deference to some crafty scheme of Satan.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Jesus Not Born in December</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">That Jesus was not born on December 25 is now an admitted fact. The circumstances surrounding His birth show that date to be wrong. It was at a time of the year when the shepherds and their flocks were in the field by night, while the stables were empty. It was not in midwinter, which even in Palestine would be too cold to keep the flocks in the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is proof that Jesus was born about the time of the autumnal equinox, approximately October 1. How, then, did the birthday of Christ happen to be associated with December 25? It is a long story, and the details are more or less obscure, but it is not hard to see the machinations of the Devil back of it all. Going back to the days of Nimrod we find some interesting clues. These are set forth at length in a book named </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons,</span><span class="font4"> by Alexander Hislop. Incidentally, this book shows up so thoroughly the pagan sources back of the practices of the Catholic church that it is not obtainable in the United States, but can be had only by addressing the publishers, Partridge, London.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Nimrod and Semiramis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Briefly the story unfolds itself as follows: Not long after the Flood the peoples of earth began to turn away from Jehovah God and to exalt instead the names of men. Foremost among the “great” men in the earth was Nimrod, who performed deeds of daring and prowess and who made a great impression. His mother, Semiramis, was an imperious woman, unscrupulous, cunning and ambitious. She idolized her son and carved for him a position of glory and power. Though the wanton shedding of the blood of animals was forbidden by the covenant which God made with Noah and all flesh, Nimrod became a mighty hunter “before the Lord”. Evidently he was not such with Jehovah’s approval, but in spite of Jehovah’s disapproval. Nimrod preferred to follow his own will rather than to obey God. The people, self-willed and apostate, preferred their visible and glamorous “hero” before Jehovah, the invisible and holy One, whose ways are righteousness and truth.—Genesis 10:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having captivated the imagination of the people, Nimrod, encouraged by his mother Semiramis, who also became his wife, furthered his ambitious designs by making himself king and undertaking the building of the tower of Babel, from which as a center he extended his kingdom to the surrounding territory in every direction. Legend and myth bring the story to us in dim outline. Only the Word of God gives us some definite and clear indications of the extent of Nimrod’s ambitions and conquests. Finally, in some manner, he was slain, whether by the beasts which he harried and hunted or by some enemy cannot be definitely determined. Hislop, in his analysis of the numerous myths about the occurrence, attempts to prove that Nimrod was judicially executed at the behest of the patriarch Shem. The Scriptures, however, are silent on this as well as other points in the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whatever the means may have been, Nimrod was slain. Semiramis, his wife and mother, determined to perpetuate the glory of her son, and incidentally her own. Urged on by Satan, she claimed that Nimrod had become a god, who, though invisible, would still be the deliverer of the people. She identified herself with the woman who was to be the mother of the seed that should bruise the serpent’s head, according to the divine promise given in Eden, and stated that Nimrod was the seed foretold. She called attention to an evergreen tree growing out of the stump of a dead tree, and asserted that the new tree sprang up in one night as a symbol of her son’s rise to new life as a god. Nimrod became “father of the gods” and Semiramis was, of course, “mother of the gods” and “queen of heaven”. By secret and magic rites the worship of Nimrod spread far and wide.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>Madonna and Child</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of time the original story regarding Semiramis and Nimrod took on varying forms. The worship of “mother and son” is found in practically all heathen religions, under one hame or another, and in many forms. In Assyria these two appear as Rhea and Ninus; in Egypt, as Isis and Osiris; in Greece, as Ceres and Dionysus, or Bacchus; in India, as Isi and Iswara; in Asia, as Cybele and Deoius; and in Pagan Rome, as Fortuna and the boy Jupiter. Even in far-away China a counterpart of the “mother and son” idea is found in Shing Moo with a child in her arms. Nimrod also appears under the names of Belus in some countries; in others, as Zoroaster, Adonis or Ninus. The Scandinavian countries, too, present in the stories of their pre-Christian gods similarities to Semiramis and Nimrod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In connection with feasts held in honor of the “queen of heaven” and “father of the gods” there were weird symbols and ceremonies, orgies, debaucheries. The chief feast of all occurred in the latter part of December or early in January, varying in different countries, but centering around the fact that the sun, having reached its lowest point, was again increasing in strength. The sun was worshiped, frequently, as the embodiment of the great “father of the gods”. The old Roman feast of the birth of Sol was observed on the 25th of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Christianity spread among the peoples of Europe, in name rather than in spirit, the feast which was originally celebrated in honor of the sun, or of Nimrod under some other name, became a bone of contention. True believers would not celebrate it at all, others compromised, and finally the name of Christ was attached to the sun-feast. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font4"> says, on this subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christmas, derived from the mediaeval </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christes Masse,</span><span class="font3"> the Mass of Christ; the feast commemorating the birth of Jesus, observed by the Christian Church annually on the 25th of December. It was, according to many authorities, not celebrated in the first centuries of the Christian Church, as the Christian usage in general was to celebrate the death of remarkable persons rather than their birth. The death of the martyr Stephen, and the massacre of the innocents at Bethlehem, had been already long celebrated, when ... a feast was established in memory of this event in the 4th century. In the 5th century the Western Church ordered it to be celebrated forever on the day of the old Roman feast of the birth of Sol, as no certain knowledge of the day of Christ’s birth existed. Among the German and Celtic tribes the winter solstice was considered an important point of the year, and they held their chief festival of Yule to commemorate the return of the burningwheel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Merry Yuletide</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia</span><span class="font4"> tells us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yule (from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">huel,</span><span class="font3"> a wheel) was a sunfeast, commemorative of the turn of the sun and the lengthening of the day, and seems to have been a period of pagan festival in Europe from ancient times. At court, among many public bodies, and in distinguished families, an officer, under various titles, was appointed to preside over the revels.... In Scotland he was termed the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Abbot of Unreason;</span><span class="font3"> but the office was suppressed by act of Parliament, A.D. 1555. Stow </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Survey of London,</span><span class="font3"> p. 79) describes the same officer as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lord of Misrule...</span><span class="font3">. Prynne says, in his strong way (in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Histrio-Mastix'j</span><span class="font3">, “Our Christmas lords of misrule, together with dancing, masks, mummeries, stageplayers, and such other Christmas disorders, now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalia and Bacchanalian festivals.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reference here to a “lord of misrule” is unmistakable reference to a representative of the Devil, one who is against the rule of the righteous Jehovah. Satan himself is the chief “lord of misrule”, and Nimrod became his first royal earthly representative, since which time the dominion of earth has been exercised by those who have not known God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the name of Christ was attached to the popular sun-feast by calling it “the mass of Christ”, it was just as heathenish as before, and practically all the heathen ceremonies and observances, together with drunkenness and ribaldry, continued. The Christmas tree, reminiscent of the tree which Semiramis employed as a symbol of her slain son-husband, saying he had become the father-son god, has been traced back to the Romans. It went from Germany to Great Britain, and thence to the United States. It has nothing to do with the worship of Jehovah or with His Son Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Befana and “Saint” Nick</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Christmas, with its numerous customs and practices, is a fusion and confusion of many holidays and ancient observances connected with heathen gods and goddesses. The holly, the mistletoe, the wreaths, the special foods, all have their significance and are hang-overs from the time when the people believed that the burning of a yule log would keep away bad luck, or the display of festoons and wreaths would exclude evil spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the feasts which, in the United States, seems to have been absorbed by the Christmas celebration is that of Befana. This old lady, in Italy, takes the place of “Saint” Nicholas. Befana is supposed to be the spirit of an old lady who, when the “wise men” passed through her little town on their way to Bethlehem, was too busy to go and look at them, intending to see them on their return. They never came back that way, and, somehow, she is still supposed to be waiting for them. At the feast of Epiphany, January 6, commemorating the visit of the &quot;wise men”, bringing their gifts, Befana is supposed to bring gifts to little children who hang up their stockings on the preceding evening. Bad children receive a stockingful of ashes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Patron of the Hock-Shop</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Saint” Nicholas, a legendary character, is supposed to have lived in the fourth century. Nothing certain is known of him, but tradition says that he helped out a poor nobleman by furnishing dowries for his three daughters, a bag of gold for each, which he threw into an open window on three successive nights. Sometimes “Saint” Nick is represented as holding three bags of gold, and at other times as holding three golden balls. He is called the patron saint of Russia, and is considered as the special guardian of virgins, children and sailors, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font4">of pawnbrokers, and sometimes of thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Europe the feast of “Saint” Nick occurs on December 6. He is dressed quite differently from the “jolly old Saint Nicholas” who in the United States is represented as riding in a sled drawn by reindeer. The European “Saint” Nicholas, which in the Netherlands is abbreviated to Sinte Klaas (hence our Santa Claus), is dressed in rich ecclesiastical vestments, wearing the high “fish-caps” of the priests of the god Dagon, and carrying his bishop’s crook. Of course, such a splendidly dressed individual could not slide down the chimney; hence the European or Netherlandish Nicholas is accompanied by a swarthy servant, whose complexion does not suffer from contact with the lining of chimneys. This dusky accomplice of the dignified bringer of gifts also carries the rod and attends to the chastening (and frightening) of bad boys and girls, and some not so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All this fibbing about “Saint” Nick and Befana, and similar stories so common in connection with the Christmas season, would be effectually ended if people believed that the dead are dead, and that neither the old Nicholas nor the unfortunate Befana can go wandering about for good or ill, if either of them ever did exist.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Old Nick or Christ?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The observance of the feast of “Saint” Nick on the same day on which Christmas is celebrated is evidently another attempt on the part of Satan to obscure the important issue before creation, and to detract from the honor that is due the One whom Jehovah has appointed to settle that issue. The effort of the adversary has been, right along, to oppose the work of God, and to bring reproach upon His name. He has exalted unrighteous men to carry forward his schemes, and has multiplied myths and superstitions to obscure the truth. Jehovah alone is God, and Jesus came to bear witness to that truth. He faithfully did bear witness and suffered death because of so doing. It is His death which He commanded His disciples to commemorate, for His death was the seal of His faithfulness and the price of mankind’s redemp tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One more point must be mentioned. It has to do with the magi, who are indirectly honored in the legends about Befana and Nicholas, bearers of gifts. The magi, incorrectly referred to as “wise men”, who came from the east to honor Jesus shortly after His birth, were undoubtedly used of Satan, though they were ignorant of that fact. The “star”, which they followed, did not guide them to the child, but to one who was the enemy of the newborn King. It was as a result of the visit of the magi, or magicians, that the babes of Bethlehem and vicinity were slain, with the object of making sure of the destruction of Christ. Surely Satan himself was back of that scheme. The instruments he used were such as would be thoroughly under his influence, for they practiced magic arts and were readily influenced by visions, omens and apparitions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Not of Jehovah God</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The entire development of the Christmas celebration marks it as not of Jehovah, but as of His enemy, Satan, whose only purpose is to confuse and confound the people, and to dishonor the One to whom all praise and honor are due. Just as at the time of Jesus’ birth Satan sent his tools to “worship” the babe, so he still uses those who are under his influence and who come in an attitude of “worship” and at the same time resist the truth. While in the past Jehovah’s people may have given unwitting support to the Christmas desecration of the truth, they will no more lend countenance thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In recent years Jehovah’s witnesses have, at the time of the autumnal equinox, or about the beginning of October, taken part in a nine-day period of praise and thanksgiving by bearing the message of the truth to the people. While this was not consciously and especially done in commemoration of God’s great gift, it is surely a fitting way to show their appreciation of the goodness of Jehovah and their desire to honor Him and His glorious King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Took Two Scientists to Do This</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">D</span><span class="font4">ISPATCHES from Paris state that it took two scientists to photograph a shroud at Milan “said to be Christ’s” and to send out word that Jesus Christ was 5 feet 10.9 inches tall, that they had found chemical stains to that effect. It is good to know that they put two high-class scientists on this job. One of them probably was given the job of seeing to it that the Jew who made the shroud had not left his price ticket on it.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HERE is a conspiracy well organized and carried forward to hide the truth and to prevent the honest people of the world from gaining a knowledge thereof. This is of such great importance now that every person who desires to do right should know about this conspiracy. Some evidence of the conspiracy is here submitted and should be carefully considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Devout men and women who are diligent in their efforts to advertise the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ arranged for a convention at Washington, D. C., the dates being May 30 to June 3, 1935. One of the outstanding events of that convention was a speech on the subject “Government”. Arrangements were made to broadcast that speech by radio. More than a hundred independent radio stations in the United States were engaged. By the co-operation of the Bell Telephone system and the R.C.A. the speech was transmitted to all parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Iceland, Scandinavian countries, Belgium, France,</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Switzerland, and also to Africa, Australia, China, the Philippines and other islands of the sea. Space was engaged in various newspapers in Great Britain to make announcement of the lecture, but at the last moment those papers refused to take the advertisement under any condition. The British Broadcasting Company refused to take the program. But telephone wires were used, and the speech was transmitted by this means to many halls throughout England and other places where the people were assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The speech was delivered at Washington, D.C., to a visible audience of more than twenty thousand persons and was simultaneously broadcast; and, from reports that immediately followed, millions of others heard. The speech was carried to and heard in almost all parts of the earth. Never before in the history of man had there been the like transmission of the human voice by means of these God-given devices of telephone, telegraph and radio. That fact was real news of great interest to the people, but the newspapers said not one word about it. The newspapers claim to publish the news, but this news of great interest to the people was ignored. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two of the leading papers of Washington, namely, the Washington </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font10"> and the Washington </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font10"> agreed for hire to publish the full text of the speech “Government”. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font10"> charged $887.00, and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font10"> $1,371.51, to publish the same. The full amount was paid to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font10"> and a receipt given for the same. Both papers, after having carefully read the speech, agreed to publish it and proceeded to put the same in type, and it was ready to go to press when suddenly some powerful influence was brought to bear causing both of those newspapers to repudiate their contracts and refuse publication of the speech unless they would be permitted to delete or strike out all that part of the speech referring to A FOREIGN POWER THAT WORKS AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AMERICAN PEOPLE.* The Roman Catholic hierarchy exerted the necessary influence to prevent the publication of the speech, and thus attempted to hide the truth from the people. Why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> magazine, in its issue of June 19, 1935, published an account of this repudiation of contracts, as well as the speech, and the following is quoted from that magazine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Rules America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Are you in favor of America being ruled by her own people? Or shall the nation be ruled by the FOREIGN POWER from Vatican City, Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why the Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font9"> and the &quot;Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font9"> choose the side of ROME.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every American should carefully read Judge Rutherford’s speech “Government” and then say whether or not American newspapers are justified in suppressing any part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Which side will the FCC and Congress support ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JEHOVAH’S witnesses had been in convention at Washington, D. C., for five days; a convention that is of world-wide interest, 20,000 or more of those devoted men and women were present; two of Washington’s leading newspapers, the Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font9"> and the Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font9"> had contracted in writing for a money consideration to print the entire speech of Judge Rutherford, which was broadcast to the ends of the earth on Sunday, June 2; the convention waited for hours to receive a copy of those papers before returning to their homes; at the last moment both of the above newspapers, yielding to some sinister influence, repudiated their contracts to publish the speech; Judge Rutherford immediately went before the convention and delivered an address that will long survive in the memories of those who heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Immediately following that address the editor of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine approached Judge Rutherford and propounded these questions: “Why is the Roman Catholic hierarchy so deeply concerned about keeping the people in ignorance of the Bible, and particularly in ignorance of the hierarchy’s crooked work? In this connection would you care to express an opinion as to the present religio-political situation in America?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He replied: “You will recall, probably, that more than two years ago in a public speech broadcast by radio I submitted proof that there was a movement on to have a dictator in America. Well, everybody can see that now, if they want to see anything. And soon they will see that, it is the Jesuit organization of the Roman Catholic hierarchy that is behind that movement to rob the American people of all their rights. The Catholic hierarchy is stealthily moving</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 411, pages 589, 590. </span><span class="font9">forward to grab control of the United States government, and for that reason is pursuing the policy that all such unrighteous organizations pursue: to keep the people blind to the truth until it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Every Catholic paper in the United States has boasted that the NRA program originated with the pope and that Mr. Roosevelt adopted it at the instance of the pope. Many other newspapers have quoted these boasts of the Catholic organization. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States recently practically annihilated the NRA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The president gave an interview to the public press shortly thereafter and, piqued by the decision of the Court, he was unable to restrain his anger and clearly let it be known that he had repudiated the Jeffersonian principles of the Democratic party that put him in office and now stands for centralization of power, dictatorship and against States’ rights. A movement is now being pushed at Washington to amend the Constitution of the United States, giving the federal government most of the power that the States now have, and thus further throttle the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Many of the official family of the president are Roman Catholics and are agents of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. If the people should now be informed that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is trying to not only control their religious thoughts and convictions but at the same time deprive them of their liberty of speech, and thought, that would greatly hinder the efforts of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to get control of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“From these facts does it not look as if Mr. Roosevelt and the Roman Catholic hierarchy have some definite understanding ? This reminds me of the memorable proverb carved by James G. Blaine, referring to the Democratic party and the Roman Catholic hierarchy, to wit: ‘Rum, Romanism and Rebellion.’ That might be amended now by saying: Rum, Romanism and Dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘' These circumstances appear to be very persuasive evidence that the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its American agents are desperately attempting to grab the job of dictator before the people know what is happening. Mr. Roosevelt seems to be the first candidate for that position. May I suggest that since his recent utterance about the Supreme Court’s decision and the States’ rights, and his close affiliation with the Roman Catholic hierarchy becoming well known, the toboggan slide has been drawn up before the White House. It might be interesting to watch it start down the incline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I am not interested in politics, but I am sure there are millions of loyal American citizens who love the principles of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution and many of them will be asking: ‘Shall America be ruled by the people, or by a few selfish men in the interest of an entrenched and foreign power, which is inimical to the liberties that the American people have long enjoyed?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“How does it happen that practically all the postmasters that are appointed are agents of the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Why is it that members of Congress are so anxious to have the approval of the ‘distinguished’ postmaster general before they act? The more you uncover this thing, the higher the stench arises, and every honest man will cry out: ‘ Shall we be governed by our own people, or shall we be governed by an Italian who lives in Rome?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Press of the Capital City</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The press of Washington, as of all other great cities of the United States and of “Christendom”, is in the hands of Big Business. It is operated not at all in the interest of the people, but wholly for predatory interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fear to displease the Roman Catholic hierarchy has whipped the press into complete subjugation to a handful of priests, and priest and press hide behind the slogan: “We love peace and will print nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It requires the help of Jehovah God to see the two organizations, His own and that of the Devil. Jesus saw them plainly, and took His stand wholly on the side of Jehovah. He could honestly say of Jehovah God, “I do always those things that please him”; and Jesus could also honestly say, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God created man, originally, with a desire to be truthful and to do right, and this desire persists in the hearts of many. Such are astonished when they first discern that ‘the god of this world is a liar, and the father of it’, and that ‘the whole world lieth in the wicked one’ and are ‘taken captive by him at his will’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was a time when the American press was somewhat interested in news. That time has passed. The desire of the press for money has overwhelmed its judgment. “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The press has determined that henceforth Jehovah’s witnesses shall see its face no more; that is, shall be denied a just and fair place in any news report, even when, as at Washington, they occupy the center of the stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two great corporations, created and financed by Big Business, control most of the radio facilities in America. Those two giant corporations have created what they call “the church of the air”, which is made up of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergymen. Those radio corporations refuse the use of their radio facilities to all who teach the truth of the Bible, and permit only clergymen of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish persuasion to say anything about religion, and this with the expressed understanding that no one will mention anything controversial. As an excuse for their action in refusing use of their radio facilities to Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast the truth of the Bible they say, “We broadcast nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Radio station WMCA of New York contracted to broadcast the Washington speech on “Government”. When the speaker reached the point where he mentioned the ‘foreign power that maintains its headquarters at Vatican City, Rome’, that radio station immediately cut off the program and announced to its audience: “Our policy is to broadcast nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspiracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A conspiracy is an agreement or understanding between two or more parties to accomplish some wrongful purpose. An agreement to hide the truth from the people, which truth is important to the people, is a conspiracy to accomplish a wrongful purpose. Circumstantial evidence is the best evidence to prove a conspiracy. Where the parties charged with a conspiracy use identically the same language or language of similar import in giving answer to their reason for taking a specific action, such is very strong and persuasive evidence that all of such parties are in the conspiracy. Note that all of the parties above mentioned use the same words, to wit: “We publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font10"> on June 18, published an editorial which is decidedly controversial :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free.—John 8:32.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Signs multiply that the administration in Washington is at heart no more of a democratic administration than any crude dictatorship hitherto known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In purpose, intention and in act, so far as it is able to translate purpose and intention into act, the administration is a conspiracy against the liberties of America, the law of the land, the authority of the courts and the desires as well as the interests of the great body of our population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If anything were needed to demonstrate this, the character of the hurriedly drawn amendments of the Agricultural Adjustment Act are evidence enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The recent unanimous decision of the Supreme Court was a body blow to the whole scheme of New Deal dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is the answer of the New Deal to this deserved and resounding check from the nation’s highest court?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Obedience? Conformity? Loyal acceptance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not at all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The answer is a rewriting of the AAA to accomplish indirectly what they despair of doing openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The demonstrated illegalities of their program are retained. Their original and illegal purposes confirmed—only the disguises altered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One thing regarding the AAA amendments the president and his secretary of agriculture perceived only too clearly—i. e., that their scheme to license every branch of the food industry of the country wouldn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such a discretion entrusted to a Government official, involving not only a delegation of the power of Congress but also its legislative discretion, would never get by the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">* « •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So, what do they do? Abandon the scheme? Not at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic hierarchy claims the exclusive right to interpret the Scriptures, even forbidding their parishioners to express their own independent views or to read the expression of anyone differing from the hierarchy. The Roman Catholic hierarchy vigorously opposes the speaking or the broadcasting of anything about the Scriptures contrary to its own views, and as an excuse for so doing says: “Speech contrary to our views shocks our religious susceptibilities and causes controversies; therefore nothing controversial should be broadcast.”'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The big radio corporations above mentioned control the NBC and the Columbia System, and they say: “We broadcast nothing that is controversial; hence only Catholics, Protestants and Jewish clergymen can use our radio facilities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The radio station that cut off the Washington program assigned as a reason, “We broadcast nothing that is controversial.” The newspapers, although claiming to publish what is of public interest, say: “We will not even publish a paid advertisement that is controversial, for hire, and hence we will repudiate our contracts.” Says the Washington </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font10"> after having received $1,371.51 and after having set the speech in type and being ready to go to press: “We regret that advertising containing controversial matter is not acceptable, and we are, therefore, returning your check.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of the aforementioned persons and corporations vigorously oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in telling the truth about the Bible, and the excuse of each and every one is that the truth is controversial. This evidence conclusively shows that all such are in a conspiracy to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Controversial</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What is a controversy or controversial matter? The definition universally given by lexicographers and universally accepted is this: “That which relates to debates or disputations; the expression of different views or opinions; a discussion of cpiestions of importance which call forth different expressions of opinions or views.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All lawsuits are controversial. One man claims something, and the other party makes an opposite claim, and each one gives expression to his views by submitting his testimony, and the court hears the evidence in order to ascertain what is the truth or right of the matter. If all controversial matters are to be rejected and that rule is followed, then there could be no way in the courts of ascertaining the truth. It at once appears that the claim of the corporations, radio stations, papers and persons aforementioned about controversial matter is a subterfuge to hide their real purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One political party is in power and is misleading the people and exercising official power and authority against the general welfare of the people. If nothing controversial can be published or broadcast by radio, then those people who are against the wrongdoers and who wish to be informed and to inform others could never be heard to open their mouths or publish a word of protest against the wrongdoers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An organization is formed and operated, the real purpose of which is to get control of the governments of the earth. That organization is operated and carries on under a religious name, claiming to use the Bible as its authority. That organization, in order to keep the people in subjection and blind to its real purpose, misapplies the Scriptures to keep the people in fear and dread while it constantly and stealthily moves forward to get complete control of the governments. If no one is permitted to publish or speak or broadcast the truth as set forth in the Bible, because such is controversial and “shocks the religious susceptibilities” of wrongdoers and exposes their wrong, that would mean that the people w’ould be kept in ignorance and not even permitted to protest against those who are robbing them of their just rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the forefathers who came to this country had been denied the opportunity to speak of matters controversial, the American nation would never have come into existence. The Declaration of Independence is controversial, because it declares against wrong and for the rights of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible is controversial, because it specifically states what matters are wrong and points out to the people the way that is right. The truth is always in controversy with falsehood, and the truth will never be uttered without raising a controversy with lies. Do you wish to support anyone who forbids the speaking or broadcasting of the truth because it is controversial ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A criminal kidnaps a child and informs the parents that unless they pay the ransom money the child will perish. The papers publish the details of the crime. Surely such publication is controversial, because it exposes the criminal and his dastardly deed. For centuries the Roman Catholic hierarchy has practiced upon the people the most gigantic fraud, in this: they teach the parents and the widows that their beloved ones that have died are suffering in “purgatory” and can be relieved only by the prayers of a priest and that they must pay money to the priest for such prayers. In this way they obtain a large amount of money. The priests pray in form only, and the people pay and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font10"> nothing, for the reason that their dead are not in “purgatory”. The Scriptures declare the dead are in their graves and know’ not anything. Witnesses for Jehovah try to tell the Bible truths to the people about “purgatory” and the state of the dead. The Roman Catholic hierarchy says: “You cannot tell or broadcast that stuff, because it is controversial and shocks our religious susceptibilities.” The public press, the big radio chain corporations, the lawmakers and law-enforcers, co-operate with those gigantic, fraudulent obtainers of money, and therefore all such are parties to the crime. Do you see why they want to hide the truth from the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Honest persons never object to their views’ being fully discussed and considered. Those who know that they are doing wrong and attempting to grab what does not belong to them always oppose anything and everything that might enlighten the people and expose the wrongdoers. That slogan, “We will publish nothing that is controversial,” is a subterfuge and a flagrant fraud practiced upon honest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But newspapers do publish controversial matter when Jehovah’s witnesses can be libeled by them. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic News</span><span class="font10"> of June 15, 1935, under an editorial headed “Another Silly Season”, publishes the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Judge Rutherford’s cohorts are in the news once more. We learn from Washington that members of his strange cult, styled by its leaders ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’, made a visitation to the Nation’s Capital over a recent week-end. . . . Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, chief ‘Witness’, delivered an address at the rally which was broadcast by radio. Subsequently, Anton Koerber, who identified himself as director of the convention, revealed that two of Washington’s leading secular newspapers had refused to publish the full text of the Rutherford address, and charged the papers with repudiating contracts. The address contained attacks on the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’ usually make themselves so ridiculous that after one or two publicity splurges by meetings and radio they retire into obscurity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Roman Catholic newspapers in the United States constantly charge that the Mexican government is persecuting Roman Catholics in that land. But the Mexican government replies that it is doing nothing of the kind and that it is only trying to protect its citizens. The Catholic newspapers say nothing about the dastardly deeds committed in Mexico by Catholic priests for the purpose of keeping the truth from the people. In the latter part of May, 1935, Mr. and Mrs. Carlos V. Calderon, two Mexican native citizens, husband and ■wife, were going from house to house in the State of Hidalgo telling the poor and priest-ridden people of God’s gracious provision to bless them under the kingdom of Christ, which is the only hope of suffering humanity. They were doing so in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment as His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They were foully murdered, and a Catholic priest is the one guilty of the shocking crime. Those two harmless persons were shot, and their bodies thrown into the road, because they were carrying the truth to the people. Roman Catholics stopped their work with the use of gunpowder and leaden balls. That is one way of hiding the truth from the people. Further information about this matter may be had by addressing the Mexican Embassy at Washington, D. C. Doubtless the newspapers would refuse to publish the facts about this foul murder of two of Jehovah’s witnesses by a Catholic priest because, as they say: '‘This is controversial, and we publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspirators</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Who are the conspirators that seek to hide the truth from the people? The chief conspirator invisible to man is Satan the Devil. He is the father of lies and prefers always to tell a lie rather than the truth, and likewise do his agents. (John 8:44) The chief visible conspirator on earth that hides the truth from the people is that organization known as the Roman Catholic hierarchy. That organization is now aided, abetted and supported by dishonest Protestant and Jewish clergymen. All of these falsely claim to represent God and Christ. They have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. (2 Timothy 3:5) They hypocritically hide from the people their real purpose and act together to hide the truth from everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are millions of honest Catholics, Protestants and Jews who are not in the conspiracy and who would not approve it if they knew it, but who at the same time are made blind by the wrongful influence exercised by the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its associates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the time of its organization, in the fourth century, till now the policy of the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been and is to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. Centuries ago it promulgated the false teaching of “purgatory”, “inherent immortality,” “eternal torment,” “apostolic succession,” and other doctrines, and punished all persons who would not accept such false teaching. The Roman Catholic hierarchy for years carried on a wicked inquisition in Spain and in Mexico and other countries, torturing millions who refused to bow to their false teachings. They hid the Bible from the people and prevented them from reading it. That wicked organization controlled and ruled from Rome for many years, and literally robbed the illiterate persons of Mexico, took away from that people millions of dollars, and continued its wrongful work until its power, was broken by the Mexican government. That same Roman Catholic hierarchy now misrepresents Mexico to the whole world and likewise slanders and misrepresents other nations and peoples that oppose its wicked work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic hierarchy is the only organization under the sun which operates under a religious name while at the same time it sends its political ambassadors to the official courts of other political nations of the earth. It exercises more political influence than any other organization on earth. It bitterly persecutes everyone who dares to tell the truth about it and its nefarious work. It is the chief organization on earth that hides from the people the truth of and concerning the Word of God and His kingdom under Christ. It bitterly opposes all witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic hierarchy organizes political agitators into parties, such as the communists, and finances and encourages and pushes such organizations forward, and then uses such agitators as an excuse to organize another political party upon the pretext of saving the government, and then the latter party grabs the government away from the people. That is exactly what has been done recently in Germany. Both the communists and the Nazis were organized by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and one played against the other to deceive the people and to furnish an excuse for seizing the power to rule Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, in order to blind the people to their real purpose, they send a nun to prison and cause wide publication of the same to be made in the newspapers. But note that the woman was not sent to prison because she told the truth, but because she carried money out of Germany. At the same time more than 1,200 of Jehovah’s witnesses are imprisoned in Germany because they met together and studied the Bible, and celebrated the Memorial of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic hierarchy is in the saddle in Quebec, and there they imprison men and women on the charge of “sedition” because such men and women distributed books containing the message of God’s Word of truth. This is done to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In northern New Jersey the Roman Catholic hierarchy controls the political offices, and within the past few years more than a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned because they carried the message of truth of God’s Word to the people. Another effort to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The endeavor of the Roman Catholic hierarchy now is to gain control of the United States government, and its purpose is to keep the people in ignorance of what it is trying to do, and hence it uses its power to prevent the speaking or publishing of anything that is “controversial” or might expose that wicked organization. It is diligent to hide the truth from the people of and concerning the righteous government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why does the Roman Catholic hierarchy try to hide the truth from the people? And what is the distinction between the hierarchy and the Catholics? The Roman Catholic hierarchy is composed of a body of men, which body of men constitute a form of government, and exercises authority over others, and particularly over those who are either directly or indirectly connected with the Catholic church. The seat of government of that organization is at Vatican City, Rome. All the common people who are associated with that organization, and generally known as “Catholics”, are not members of the hierarchy or of the Catholic church, but are designated by the hierarchy as “children of the church”, and these children are not supposed to have sufficient sense to attend to their own business or hear what they want to hear. Millions of persons have been induced to believe that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is a divine institution which they must obey. But such claim is entirely erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Scriptures make known that Jehovah God’s organization in heaven is made up of Christ J esus, the Head thereof, and of cherubim, seraphim and angels. The Devil, who is a mimic god, has attempted to imitate or mimic Jehovah by forming an organization, which organization the Scriptures describe, and name the Devil as the chief, and that the organization consists of “principalities, powers, and rulers of darkness of this world’. (Ephesians 6:12) The Devil seeks to rule all peoples of earth and keep them in subjection to himself and to completely turn them away from God. The Devil resorts to fraud, deceit and lies, because he is the father of lies. (John 8:44) He well knows that he must deceive the people in order to rule them, because men do not willingly wish to follow the Devil. The Devil, therefore, causes an organization to be formed amongst men to represent him, and which organization falsely claims to be of divine origin and authority; but the fact is, that organization is fraudulent and is carried on to deceive the people, and millions are deceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Devil’s ambitious purpose is to rule all peoples of the earth. He employs the Roman Catholic hierarchy as his chief means on earth to accomplish that purpose. The Devil injects into the minds of those men who compose the Roman Catholic hierarchy the conclusion that they must rule the nations of the earth; and hence the Roman Catholic hierarchy puts forth its greatest efforts to get control of all the nations. For many centuries that fraudulent organization, operating under the name of Christ, ruled the people of Spain, Mexico and other countries, and, in order to do so, hid the truth from the people and kept most of them in illiteracy. For many years it has diligently attempted to gain complete control of the American government and to bring the people of the nation completely under its subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pope is the nominal head of the Catholic organization, but he is not the real power or head. The controlling earthly power is the hierarchy made up of a limited number of men known as cardinals, bishops and priests, and who maintain their official offices at Rome and direct even the pope what he must say and do, and use him to mislead the people. The power invisible that in fact controls the entire organization is Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan is named in the Scriptures as The prince of the power invisible’; “the prince [ruler] of this world”; “the power of darkness”; The ruler of darkness of this world.’ (Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; John 12:31; Colossians 1:13) Satan’s purpose is to keep everybody in ignorance of the truth of God’s Word and by this means hold them under his dominion and control and keep them away from God and His truth. For this reason Jesus says: &quot;The truth shall make you free.” (John 8: 32) Satan uses every agency that he can employ to hide the truth from the people, and for this reason he causes his agents to say: “We will publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic hierarchy falsely claims to represent God. If that organization did represent God, then, instead of hiding the truth from the people, it would be diligent to teach to the people the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom and would gladly co-operate with anyone else who tells the people about God’s kingdom, which is the hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From its foundation the United States has been known as the place of freedom of speech, but in recent years not only has there been put forth a desperate effort to hide the truth from the people and to prevent the publication thereof, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its allies have persecuted everyone that dares tell the people the truth of God’s Word or publish the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people must now consider whether they wish to exercise freedom of speech or whether they wish to be completely dominated and controlled by that foreign power at Vatican City, Rome. In order to be free the people must have the truth. If the Roman Catholic hierarchy gets control of America, the people will not be permitted to receive and have the truth, much less to speak it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not at all necessary to prevent the Catholic church from teaching its doctrines. Let all be free to speak as they will, and let the people hear both sides and then themselves decide which course they wish to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All true followers of Christ Jesus on earth must tell the truth to their neighbors, because such is the commandment of God and Christ Jesus. (John 18:37; Matthew 24:14) God has selected for himself a people whom He has anointed and appointed and commanded to tell the truth to the peoples of earth. (Acts 15:14; Isaiah 43:10) The Devil and his earthly agents conspire to hide the truth from the people and to cause Jehovah’s witnesses to fail in their covenant to obey God. Those conspirators led by Satan are against all whom God has sent forth to be His anointed witnesses. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has drawn into Satan’s net almost all of the kings and rulers of the nations of the earth, and now makes a last and desperate attempt to control the American government. God foreknew and foretold these very things and caused His prophet to write: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their’ bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (Psalm 2: 2, 3) “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”—Psalm 83: 2, 3, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Into this conspiracy Satan, operating through the Roman Catholic hierarchy, has drawn the owners of big broadcasting stations, the big newspapers and magazines, politicians and officers of the law and many others. All of these are trying to hide the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom and to prevent the people from hearing about it. That is the reason why hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested and imprisoned; that is the reason why the big radio corporations and the newspapers say, “We will publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses are putting forth their best efforts to get to the people the truth of and concerning God’s purpose, in order that the people may see what is the only hope for their peace, prosperity and life. Jehovah’s witnesses are not asking or expecting the people to join some earthly organization. Their sole work is to tell God’s truth as commanded by Him, that the people may make an intelligent choice as to ■whom they wish to serve. It is the will of Jehovah God that there shall be controversies between truth and lies, and, because the nations of the earth have chosen to take the side of the Devil, God says to them, “[Jehovah] hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead [inform and reason with them] with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord.” (Jeremiah 25:31) The people must hear the truth in order to be able to choose to serve God and live or remain with the Devil and suffer destruction. (Jeremiah 25:32,33) Satan seeks to turn all people away from God and bring them into destruction; therefore Satan and all of his deluded agents are desperately trying to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With feigned honesty the desire is expressed by the big newspapers and radio owners to keep the peace by saying: “We will publish nothing controversial.” But such is really and in fact a trick, fathered by Satan the Devil, to deceive the people and hide from them the truth while his agents lead them all into the ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the Devil can succeed in hiding the truth from the American people, then he will accomplish two things, to wit: He will enable the foreign power at Rome, which the Devil created, to get control of and rale America, and, second, to turn the people away from God and ultimately into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Which side are you on? Whom do you wish should rule ? If you want life, peace and happiness and continuous prosperity, learn the truth and stand over on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many persons have sincerely associated themselves with the Catholic church; but when they learn the truth, they find they have been greatly deceived by a small company of selfish men operating an organization for a selfish purpose. Likewise many of you have associated yourselves with the Protestant church organization, which once vigorously protested against the Roman Catholic hierarchy; but now the Protestant leaders have ceased to protest and have joined forces with the hierarchy and entered into the conspiracy against God and against His anointed. The Jews are in a similar condition. That explains why the so-called “church of the air” was created by the two great radio chain corporations in America, and why the hierarchy’s representatives and the Protestant and Jewish clergymen are permitted to use the radio facilities to the exclusion of all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning all of those conspirators God caused this to be written: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Psalm 2:4, 5, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The day of great crisis is here, and the people must choose whom they will serve. God will see to it that they have the opportunity to hear the truth, that they may intelligently choose their own destiny. Do your part. Hear the truth of God’s Word and be diligent to pass that truth on to your neighbors. The kingdom of God under Christ is here, and God points to Christ Jesus, His glorious King, and says to the people : “Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom I take delight: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the nations. The nations also will hope in his name.”—Matthew 12:18, 21, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Minnesota. Sauk Rapids: “I heard the lecture June 2 on ‘Government’. It was superior to all others, and words are inadequate to describe its forcefulness and beauty. Needless to say, I arose and said ‘Aye’ at the resolution.”—Mrs. H. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mississippi. Iuka: “ ’Twas the most astounding speech since the days of our Lord on the earth. I frankly say with a whole heart, there is no refuge of lies that can withstand or successfully resist such hail of truth as your speech contained, and at the battle of the great day of God Almighty every eye will see and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Thanks be to the Almighty God, and more power to you by His grace.”—S. G. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rockport : ‘ ‘ Your world-wide broadcast from Washington, June 2, subject ‘Government’, was greatly appreciated and enjoyed by several in this little village.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Missouri. Collins: “Just could not refrain from telling you how well I enjoyed hearing your voice June 2 over the radio. How thrilled to hear your calm voice coming from so many miles away ... in these dark hours.”—Mrs. R. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Louisiana: “We wish to add our applause to that of those at Washington and of others throughout the world that heard your bold and fearless voice yesterday. . . . Thanks, many thanks for words of encouragement and sympathy, and we now know that the Almighty God, Jehovah, is leading you, for no man could by himself utter words and ‘walk in the valley of the shadow of death’ as you did yesterday, </span><span class="font9">and stand by himself. We are with you and add ‘Aye’ to the resolution.”—E. McD. and A. McD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nebraska. Chappell: “Heard your epochal address from Washington, D. C., entitled ‘Government’. It was most courageous, thrilling and inspiring, and pulled the mask of hypocrisy from the Roman hierarchy and other opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses and, above all, of Jehovah and of His Christ.”—F. W</span><span class="font9"><sup>T</sup>. U.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New Hampshire. Elkins: “Your thrilling message came through perfectly over station WNBX, Springfield, Vt. Such a wonderful proclamation for Jehovah and for His Vindicator.”—E. C.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mills: “Just heard the wonderful message that you so fearlessly delivered to all the world, by His grace.

F., Sr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New York. Auburn: “I have been waiting over forty years to hear just such a message, and to say that I thank you is not enough.”-—H. R. 0.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hempstead: “I want you to know that I enjoy your messages very much and I listen to them as much as I possibly can. Just what was so objectionable about the Washington address that it was discontinued, ‘with due apologies,’ by station WMCA of New York? They evidently hate to hear the truth. They broadcast ‘church’ messages without fear of offending anyone. As near as I can see, Christ has more enemies now than at His last visit to earth, and yet all church members claim to love and honor Him. . . . The churches are the greatest of hypocrites. I have completely severed my connection with them, and, of course, I have made many my enemies; but they are well lost to me; I neither want them nor do I miss them in the least.”—B. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syracuse: “Hurrah for Jehovah for giving us the wonderful privilege of hearing the message over WESG very clearly!”—J. Q.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Winfield: “Your talk on ‘Government’ delivered Sunday afternoon was very much enjoyed. In these times when people are falling away from God and having lust for worldly things, talks of this nature will open people’s eyes. Please send me a copy. I congratulate you for the good courageous truths you are broadcasting.”—J. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">North Carolina. Asheboro: “First may I thank the great Jehovah God for using you in delivering such a wonderful lecture. Even- word came in clear.” —P. V. S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ohio. Alliance: “I thank God for your courage. We need men who tell the truth, and I believe the great Jehovah has sent you to lead the people of good Mill and the work will go on.”—Mrs. J. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Oklahoma. Lindsay: “Party of ten listened to your lecture and enjoyed it immensely. ’ ’-Mrs. H. R. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Washington. Seattle: (1) “I am grateful that one man has the courage to broadcast to the world what is about to befall the powers that are crushing the people on all sides, and am glad to hear that redemption is drawing nigh for the people 11-110 are striving for the right.”—E. H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2) “I am glad you have the courage and can carry on in spite of the fact that ‘that foreign power’ is so strong and trying to keep you off the air, but with the help of God I hope you can continue the fight.”—M. L. H.</span></p>

Let His enemies be put to shame, that men may know Jehovah. Psalm 83:17,18.”—E. C. 0., L. N., Mr. and Mrs. H. N., A. K., W. K., and L. N. K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">West Virginia. Coco: “Your wonderful radio message from Washington, D. C., was received, and . . . we hail the new ‘Kingdom’ with joy and gladness! We humbly ask that God continue to ‘give us our daily bread’ through His witnesses and to prepare us for ‘the Kingdom of Righteousness’, where we will praise Him forever.”—A company of “ Jonadabs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wisconsin. Madison: “You may count on six of my family for support at any time. Your message was the best broadcast ever to be on the air.”-C. E.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Hitler Shows His Catholic Training</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ROTESTANT theological students in Germany must serve their full time both in the Storm Troop and in labor service; Catholic theological students are freed from both. A Protestant book criticizing Rosenberg’s attack on Christianity was suppressed; no effort was made to suppress a Catholic book treating the same subject in a similar manner. Hitler shows his Catholic training.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Government by Alphabet</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font10">O MAN can be wrong in everything, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Herbert Hoover is not wrong when he says that the government of America’s forefathers is in process of destruction at Washington, and a European form of government is being substituted. The oldest government in the world operates by a system of Orders, Companies, Societies, Sons, Servants, Fathers, Congregations, Institutes, Oblates, etc., to each of which is entrusted a specific task. Thus the order OP, Order of Preachers (Patres Saori Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum) (p. 647 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Official Catholic Directory),</span><span class="font10"> but more commonly called Dominican Fathers (p. 739), is entrusted with the Inquisition. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">McClintock £ Strong’s Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> Vol. 2, page 859.) The present pope, at about the time his “holy year” was inaugurated, told the Dominicans to get ready to do their stuff again. Priest No. 67 is an OP, and so are Nos. Ill, 119,162,170,172, and 182; three of these reside at 869 Lexington avenue, New York city. At this rate, out of 30,250 priests in the country, 1,163 are Dominicans. Well, a little handful of 1,163 Dominicans would certainly have their hands full if they started out to torture 140,000,000 Americans into conformity in these days, and would have to have mighty good backing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again, the order CSP, Paulist Fathers (So-cietas Sacerdotum Missionariorum a S. Paulo Apostolo), Congregation of St. Paul the Apostle, legal name “Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle”, p. 643 of directory (also p. 739), is entrusted with suppression of truth over the radio. SJ (Societas Jesu), Jesuit Fathers, is numerically powerful. Priests Nos. 11, 14, 29, 40, 53, 72, 79, 82, 85, 102, 120, 126, are Jesuits. At this rate, there are 2,881 in the country. The Jesuit offices, where plans for taking over the government of the United States are worked out in detail, are located at Woolworth Building, 233 Broadway, New York. (Page 107 of directory) The alphabetical method is the method that is being used, and to make the matter more clear there is given below the alphabetical lineup of the Roman Government and of the American Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Jesuits seem to have done a good job, but it is not clear at the moment why the American Government has 82 alphabetical combinations as against the Roman Government’s 79, though it is interesting that while the Roman has duplicate CR and SM combinations, the United States also has duplicates in its CCC and FAC. No doubt there is a reason for all this. In the United States, for the present, the Roman names are set aside and here the departments go by the names of boards, corporations, administrations, commissions, councils, authorities, committees, banks, divisions, co-operatives, foundations, advisers, projects, agreements, corps, works, co-ordinators, offices, and acts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font10">NCE there was a man who said he was going to cut the cost of government by 25 percent when he became president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That man has been president three years now, and this is what a check-up on his promise shows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are now 989 men drawing regular salaries of $10,000 a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 7,223 men and women drawing regular salaries of between $5,000 and $10,000 a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">President Roosevelt’s promise to cut government costs apparently has been about as good as his promise to bring about a redistribution of wealth in this country. In both cases he has gone exactly the opposite way from what he promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Key Men” Feather Nests</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The lists of the $10,000-or-more-a-year men includes practically all the “key men” of the New Deal, who have been uncannily skillful at feathering their own nests while blocking every proposal for the relief of the 22,000,000 people who have been pauperized by the Roosevelt depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The $5,000-$10,000 class includes dozens of former newspaper men hired in defiance of the law as “publicity men” to feed the newspapers, radio, and motion pictures with propaganda designed to fasten the claws of the Blue Eagle into the nation for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Harry L. Hopkins gets $10,000 a year for sitting on the lid in Washington, telling states that they must pass sales tax laws if they want any Federal relief money, and building up a political machine which tells starving people: “Kiss the foot of our beloved president, or you get no soup meat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jim Farley Draws $15,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">James A. Farley draws down $15,000 a year for remembering his friends with little $100,000 gifts of rare stamps and for directing the activities of the greatest gang of political cutthroats and crooks ever assembled by any government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Robert Feehner gets $12,000 a year for telling CCC boys where to plant saplings so that they will have to be rooted up next year and planted again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Henry A. Wallace is rewarded with $15,000 yearly for thinking up such ideas as slaughtering all young pigs and throwing milk into the rivers. To help him think up these ideas he has a whole staff of assistants, including Rexford G. Tugwell and Chester C. Davis at $10,000 apiece, and Alfred D. Stedman at $9,800 to write newspaper stories telling how brilliant Mr. Wallace is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other $10,000-a-year men include the Standard Oil magnate, James A. Moffett, who worked out the plan by which home-owners could borrow money from the banks at 10 percent interest for repairs; Francis Biddle, whose job consists of persuading striking workers that they should be mighty glad to go back to work at whatever their employer wants to pay, and John H. Fahey, chief of the Home Owners Loan Corporation, which has been operated as one of the greatest swindling rackets this country has ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bernard Baruch’s handy man, Geo. N. Peek, cashes in for $12,000 as “special adviser to the president on foreign trade”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The president’s cousin, Henry L. Roosevelt, manages to pick up cigarette money of $9,000 as assistant secretary of the navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And that is only the beginning. There are about 980 others drawing upwards of $10,000 a year. The Roosevelt machine is mighty well oiled—-for taking the taxpayers for a ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Four Statements by the Clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio Farmer</span><span class="font10"> recites the following as four statements made by the clergy eighteen years ago this summer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1) “It is'neither a travesty nor an exaggeration to call this war on the part of the United States a holy war.” (2) “It is God who has summoned us to this war. It is His war we are fighting. This conflict is indeed a crusade. Think it through and at bottom, war is religious.” (3) “It is simply to say that we are in the war because we believe that thereby we are somehow serving God. The war for righteousness will be won. Let the church do her part.” (4) “We will fight pacifism, not only because it is contrary to the teachings of Christ, but because it marks a yellow streak where you want a man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of these statements it is very apparent that if war breaks out again the best interests of mankind require that the clergymen of all denominations be sent to the front-line trenches with the very first detachment of troops.</span></p>

He told them the story of the truth; quietness reigned; everybody went back to work the next morning. While not as busy as he could wish to be, Oathout found opportunity to improve somewhat on the poetic license issued at one time to Alfred Tennyson. He is hoping that Tennyson has no surviving relatives. Anyway, here goes the “poem”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THE CHARGE OF THE TEN MILLION (unemployed)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">L. Arnold, pastor of the Johnson Memorial Baptist church of Raleigh, was to offer prayer. He read a manuscript to the Almighty, intended to be full of information and instruction on the liquor question. When the dissertation was ended he was rebuked publicly by Senator Hill, a life-long dry. The minister then replied to Senator Hill, and was rebuked again for violating legal procedure in addressing the chair, as that right is for senators only. With that the minister got up and went out, which seems to be the only sensible thing that he did on that auspicious occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE Washington state legislature was considering a memorial urging Congress </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">make the Pacific coast more secure against attack. Michael B. Smith, former Seattle prize fighter, stood by the Prince of Peace. He protested against the memorial, saying: “Like Germany, we are looking to armament supremacy as our god. Preparing for war does not mean peace. Greater armaments bring war.” And then rose in his might the Reverend David E. Gifford, Seattle minister, with his religion and perhaps his collar on backwards and said: ‘We must be prepared to resist invasion. It is true we have international law, but only force makes law enforceable.” And then the Olympia house, by a vote of 87 to 10, went on record as opposed to the prize fighter, who stood by the Prince of Peace, and aligned themselves up with the apostle of war who professes to be a son of God. How the angels strolling up and down with gas masks on their noses and machine guns ready for action must have laughed at it all when they reported to the one whom the apostle styles “the god of this world”.</span></p>

By a vote of 101,702 to 10,030 they favored government control of munitions, and by a vote of 91,088 to 19,521 favored universal conscription in case of war. Besides taking over the munition plants, the government should send the international murderers themselves to the trenches; but as those men control the governments, and hamstring their effort to live in peace with each other, it does not just appear how this is all to be brought about.</span></p>

The remaining $2,000,000,000 is now being rapidly absorbed by shyster lawyers on and off the bench through misnamed ‘bondholders’ protective committees’.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">H</span><span class="font10">YPOCRISY means to practice dishonesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It means to pretend to be one thing and in fact to be the very opposite thereof. If a man holds himself out before the people as a minister of God and Christ Jesus and then denies the inspiration of the Bible and the value of the sacrifice of Christ Jesus, that man is a hypocrite. Says the scripture (Isaiah 32:6): ‘A vile person will practice hypocrisy, and utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry.’ Satan the Devil induces men to be hypocrites and then uses such men to turn others away from God and Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary Digest</span><span class="font10"> submitted a questionnaire to the pastors of the churches of the United States, and in answer thereto a majority of them stated that they do not believe that the sacrifice of the man Christ Jesus provided redemption for mankind. Such men are clearly hypocrites within the Scriptural meaning of that word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Religion is the Devil’s best means to cause men to practice hypocrisy. For instance, all church denominations teach that the wicked must spend eternity suffering conscious torment in hell-fire. When these men are asked privately concerning their belief they answer that they do not believe that God has provided a place of eternal torment, yet they have induced the people to believe that great falsehood. They know that there is no scripture that supports the doctrine of eternal torture. If they were honest they would tell the people the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Israelites were God’s favored people, and to them He gave the law and the prophets. He appointed priests to minister unto them concerning God and His truth. Those priests were the clergymen of that day, and were called Pharisees and Sadducees, and they claimed to represent God. They yielded to improper and selfish influence and became hypocrites. They violently opposed Christ Jesus and His teaching concerning God’s Word. He said to them: ‘Why do you not understand me? I tell you the truth and you believe me not, but seek to kill me.’ Jesus then told those clergymen that they were hypocrites and servants of the Devil. (John 8:40-44) The pastors of the present time claim to represent Christ and yet they violently oppose those who would tell the people about His kingdom. The Scriptures declare that the sole hope of the nations of the earth is the kingdom of God under Christ. When Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people with books which enable them to find the truth concerning the Kingdom these pastors or clergymen advise the people to destroy such books. They refuse to preach the Kingdom, and try to prevent others from finding out about it. To such Jesus says (Matthew 23:13): “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Public officials and selfish commercial men employ many schemes to defraud the people, and clergymen claiming to serve God publicly support such unrighteous men and tell the people that they are ruling by divine right. It was so in the days of Jesus, and concerning men of that type Jesus said (Matthew 23:14): “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Word of God plainly states that those who honestly represent Him and His kingdom must keep themselves separate and unspotted from the world and lead a clean and pure life. The pastors or clergymen outwardly advocate a clean and proper life and yet at the same time support fraudulent schemes and impure and wicked men and aid them in carrying out unrighteous schemes against the people. To such Jesus says (Matthew 23:25,28): “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why do men practice hypocrisy? Because they have fallen victims to the subtle influence of the Devil. They have become blind to God’s Word, and Satan uses them to keep the people in blindness. Attention is called to the practice of hypocrisy of such men, not for the purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of holding them up to ridicule, but that the people may see that such men are not safe guides in matters pertaining to the Scriptures. The only true guide is the Word of God. At 1 Thessalonians it is written: Trove all things, and hold fast that which is good.’</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>A Shining Example</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">TT IS to be expected that in the Roman Catholic province of Quebec most judges are Roman Catholics, and we apprehend this to be true of Mr. Justice Walsh, in the opinion which follows. Mr. Walsh denies the appeal of George H. Brodie from a sentence of 60 days’ imprisonment and a fine of $300 for having given away some copies of a booklet by Judge Rutherford entitled </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span><span class="font10"> The books were given away in the city of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Millions who have read Judge Rutherford's books, including </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font10"> find nothing blameworthy in them, but everything praiseworthy. They do indeed point out that God’s kingdom is the only possible hope of the world, and they make clear that the Devil's kingdom, of which the Scriptures have so much to say, will utterly perish at Armageddon. What is wrong with that? Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Justice Walsh pleads for Mr. Brodie to go to prison, not because Brodie has done any wrong to anybody, but, apparently, because Mr. Walsh is a Roman Catholic, and as a Roman Catholic he stands for everything the Roman Catholic clergy stand for, and is against everything they are against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his pleadings he admits that “no particular words constitute the offense”. Then why be so anxious to see a fellow man behind bars? He says, “There appears to be no statutory definition of the term ‘seditious libel’.” That should have made him very careful about trying to define it himself, but he made a most determined attempt, strung over many pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To believe Mr. Justice Walsh, it is seditious to “induce discontent”, to “stir up opposition to the Government”, to “disturb the tranquillity of the State”, to “subvert the Government”, to “impute improper motives”, and yet one may “exhibit the imbecility of the Government”, as is here and now done, and one may “impute error and suggest improvement”, as is always done in all of Judge Rutherford’s writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh admits what cannot be denied, that “there is no sedition in just censure or criticism” and that “comparisons of forms of government are permissible”. Well, then, Judge Rutherford levels against all the governments of this earth the just censure and criticism that they are governments of the Devil, and compares their forms with that of the Son of God which is to take their place. To deny that one may proclaim the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray is to follow the example of Germany and seat the Devil openly upon his throne, there to remain throughout all time, secure from all reproach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh says: “The test is: ‘Is the language calculated to promote disorder or force or violence?’—‘to incite the people to take the power into their own hands’?” and then makes the fatal admission that “the people are told to be patient, and to await Armageddon, when the hosts of the Lord will fight for them”, and the further fatal admission that “the conclusions of these pamphlets are left in mid-air; the policy suggested is one of prayerful watching and waiting”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Despite these admissions, Mr. Walsh tries to make it appear that he finds “in these pamphlets a sapping of all authority, to be replaced only by anarchy and mob-rule”. Is the placing of Christ Jesus upon His throne a sapping of all authority? Is that anarchy? Is that mob-rule?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh pleads as to what unbelievers might do if convinced that Judge Rutherford’s interpretations of the Bible are correct. He says: “Many unbelievers would revolt at once, did they believe that justice could not be earlier served.” That is so preposterous that it is hard to be patient. They are unbelievers to start with; they read Judge Rutherford's books and become believers; the judge urges them to be patient and wait on the Lord, wait till Armageddon, and off they go in revolt, entirely contrary to what they learned. Surely nobody but a Roman Catholic could reason like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then, says Mr. Walsh: “Others would doubt the authority and the ability of these teachers to interpret the Bible,” and that would be Mr. Walsh himself, for he takes pains to say that “the citations may be correct, but they have been misinterpreted and misapplied”. Very well! For the sake of the argument, allow that Judge Rutherford is teaching something that is not taught by any of the something like 400 sects of Christians now to be found in •‘Christendom”: would Mr. Walsh undertake to decide which of these teachers have the authority and the ability to correctly interpret and apply the Scriptures ? Would he set 399 of these teachers aside and say, when he came to the Roman Catholic church, “Here alone is truth”? The answer is that that is just what he would do if he were under the thumb of some priest while he was writing his opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Going back to his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">pleadings,</span><span class="font10"> Mr. Walsh says: “Liability depends, not on the truth of the words used, nor in the motives of the publisher, but on the question whether the words used, having regard to the audience addressed, were calculated to promote public disorder, physical force or violence.” Mr. Walsh well knows that the circulation in Quebec of literature uncomplimentary to the Roman Catholic church would be dangerous only to the one who circulated it. The disorder, if any, would be on the part of those determined to learn nothing and encouraged in that wrong course by the religious parasites that have made Quebec one of the most benighted regions on the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh makes some startling admissions regarding the conditions which exist in Quebec and elsewhere. He speaks of “our present distress”; so does Judge Rutherford. He says, “Two or three years ago, we all believed that our civilization and culture, that our economic system, were the greatest that man could evolve.” The time limit seems to suggest that a great light is slowly dawning even in the mind of Mr. Justice Walsh. He goes on to say that “the great majority of thinkers, until very recent years, would believe nothing to the contrary. Any other prophet then would have been stoned”. That is just too bad, for the “thinkers”. It is hard to think with blinders on. And, anyway, thinkers should not be in such a hurry to throw stones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He says “we have discovered flaws in our structure” and “it is even recognized that the troubles of the people mean eventually the ruin of their leaders, unless efforts be made to rectify conditions”. According to that, Judge Rutherford is one of Mr. Walsh’s best and truest friends, for he is trying to show him how, only, he can keep his job. The psalmist was engaged in the same thankless undertaking when he wrote, “Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh says that “Government and Business are aware of the difficulties of a situation which requires careful attention”. That is well. Nobody on earth has done more to help them see what is wrong than Judge Rutherford. About every one of these biggest toads in the puddle was personally called upon and handed a little book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World. </span><span class="font10">Perhaps Mr. Walsh also had one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh says that “efforts are being applied to correct abuses”. That is the very thing Judge Rutherford everywhere encourages. He says, “A complex system has to be overhauled.” So it must; it must be either overhauled or hauled over to the dump. He says: “We may be floundering, but an honest effort is made.” The first half of that sentence is true, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh plays both ends against the middle. In one paragraph he starts off by saying that “when nerves are racked, demagogues and saviors play on emotions”, and winds up by saying, “Born overnight, with a pseudo-divine mission, they disappeared in the mists created by themselves.” Why worry about one more so-called “false savior”, with the Roman Catholic church, and 399 others only a little less culpable and untrustworthy, already on the job?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He pleads for “co-operation and universal brotherly love”. Then why not show some of it? Why throw innocent men into prison to satisfy a corrupt and bloodthirsty priesthood? He says that “all were wedded to the system”. So much the worse for the system. Somebody, sometime, had to have the faith in God to tell them about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He asks, “If w<sup>T</sup>e are to await Armageddon, why stir passions, and expose personages to execration ?” The question answers itself. Why get stirred with passion because the voice of Jehovah God thunders that Armageddon is at the door ? Why worry about important personages when earth’s greatest cataclysm impends? God is no respecter of persons, not even of Mr. Justice Walsh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Walsh states that ‘‘both church and state everywhere want the kingdom of God on earth”. Mr. Walsh never made a more gross misstatement in all his life. That is just what church and state do not want, and what they are determined not to have, even if they have to imprison or kill every one of Jehovah’s witnesses on the face of the earth. He says, “Inspiration must be properly directed”; and if you ask, How? his only answer consistent with his “opinion” and decision must be, “You must get your instructions from Rome, the same as I do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In reading the opinion, which follows, lovers of truth and of liberty can hardly fail to see that about the only sensible or fair thing in Mr. Walsh’s pleadings on behalf of the Roman Catholic church (which church he is careful not to mention) are the extracts from Judge Rutherford’s writings which the opinion contains. Mr. Walsh merely makes out a case against himself. He should omit the word “Justice” from before his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Sir James Stephen (Digest p. 70, 6 ed.) asks whether “seditious conspiracy” is “sedition”, and he declares that it is not easy to attribute any other meaning to the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every one commits the common law misdemeanor of “seditious conspiracy” who agrees to do any act for the furtherance of a “common seditious intention.” (Halsbury No. 901)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ Where words are the essence of an offence, they must be set out verbatim”; (Halsbury Indictments, p. 339 No. 66'2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This does not apply to our case, because no particular words, but an ensemble, constitutes the offence. It was not sufficient to provide herein only extracts. It was necessary to produce all the pamphlets. When particulars were asked, the Crown submitted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ The whole of the writing need not be set forth in the indictment; if any part of it varied or controlled the sense of the matter alleged to be seditious, the onus is upon the defendant to show it.” (R. vs. Crowe, 3 Cox 193)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Conspiracy for seditious purposes is indictable, sedition itself being a criminal offence,” (Russell, p. 152).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> ‘ Though it is usual first to state the conspiracy, and then to aver that, in pursuance of it, certain overt acts were done, it is sufficient to state the conspiring alone. Where the conspiracy is to commit a criminal offence, it is not necessary to state the means by which the object was to be effected, as the conspiracy may be complete before the means to be used are taken into consideration.” (Russell, p. 181)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Where the alleged conspiracy is to effect objects made unlawful by statute, it is sufficient to follow the terms of the statute. As a general rule, where the conspiracy is not to commit an offence, but to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means, the indictment must allege the doing of the unlawful act, or it will be insufficient.” (Russell, p. 181)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lord Mansfiel, C. J., ‘ ‘ The conspiracy is stated and its object; it is not necessary that any means should be stated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The indictment contained a complete description of a common law misdemeanor. (Tinsdale, C. J. t Russell, p. 183)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ The gist of the indictment was the conspiracy, and there might be so much uncertainty in the transaction that tho allegation could not be made with greater certainty ...” (Russell, p. 185).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is not necessary to prove any direct concert or even any meeting of the conspirators, as the actual fact of conspiracy may be collected from the collateral circumstances of the case; it is to be inferred from the conduct of the parties”; (Russell, p. 191).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is clearly established that every conspiracy to commit an offence punishable by law is an indictable offence. Where the conspiracy is executed, it appears to merge in the completed offence. Conspiracies of this kind are merely auxiliary to the law which creates the principal crime. . . . This form of conspiracy included combination to violate the provisions of a statute ... if the violation of the statute is a misdemeanor at common law or visited by a specific criminal penalty; it also extends to include combination to commit a breach of the peace”; (Russell, 7 ed. p. 150).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ A seditious libel is one expressive of a seditious intention. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> ‘ A seditious conspiracy is an agreement to carry into execution a seditious intention”; (132 Cr. C.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The appellant was charged in the words of the Criminal Code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To understand the latter, it is necessary to go to the common law, which is in effect, if not abrogated, in the matter of sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There appears to be no statutory definition of the term “seditious libel” other than that which is contained in the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The intention is to be collected from the paper itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The objects of sedition generally are to induce discontent ... to stir up opposition to the Government and to bring the administration of justice into contempt ; the tendency is to incite the people to insurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sedition embraces everything calculated to disturb the tranquillity of the State, and lead ignorant persons to subvert the Government and laws of the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A woodcut or engraving may be a seditious libel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The jurors are the sole judges of the guilt or innocence of the accused. A man who criticizes Government should not impute improper motives; his language should be temperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whether the expedient be by ridicule or obloquy, it is a crime to cause the alienation of the people’s affections; though it is the right of a British subject to exhibit the imbecility of the Government; this must be done without violating feelings. (Starkie, Slander &amp;&nbsp;Libel, 3 ed. eh. 33, p. 637)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The common law, as formulated by the authors and by jurisprudence, declares:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seditious words are those that tend to bring into hatred and contempt His Majesty, the Government, or to excite subjects to attempt to alter matters of church or state ... by force; the test is: “Is the language calculated to promote disorder or force or violence?” There is no sedition in just censure or criticism or in seeking to redress grievances or in fair discussion. The jury should consider the state of the country and of the public mind . . . passages may be pernicious in times of stress; the jury will gather the general effect on the public, to discover an intent to promote discontent and disorder. Theoretical political discussions, comparisons of forms of government are permissible. It is a misdemeanor to defame courts and the administration of law in order to diminish authority, though fair criticism in a liberal spirit is allowed; Odgers, Libel &amp;&nbsp;Slander, 5 Edit, ch. 19, p. 513.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A person does not offend, unless he intends to work mischief, evidenced by a licentious and insulting manner. The constitution and ordinances should be secure from contempt, lest men effect a haughty and ill-judged demolition of the political fabric, which others would be provoked to defend by violence what they hold in reverence. Written attacks tending to defame or calumniate economy, order and administration of the government are seditious and dangerous because they appeal to the passions and not to reason of the multitude; they unsettle the people, relax authority and impair reverence of law. Every Englishman may write within limits, but he must not endanger fundamentals of the constitution ■ he may impute error and suggest improvement; he cannot provoke passion ; he is controlled when he trespasses beyond necessity ; Starkie, Slander &amp;&nbsp;Libel, 5 ed. ch. 33, p. 637.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The freest public discussion, comment and censure, in relation to all political or party questions, of all public acts is permitted; no narrow construction is to be put upon the expressions used ■ but the criticism and censure must be without malignity, and must not impute corrupt or malicious motives. (Halsbury, No. 902)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Something must be allowed for feelings in men’s minds and for some warmth of expression, but an intention to incite the people to take the power into their own hands and to provoke them to tumult and disorder is a seditious intention.” (R. vs. Collins (1839) 9 C. &amp;&nbsp;P. 456)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The character of the words may form irresistible evidence of the nature of the intention.” (Halsbury 902)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A seditious intention is one that tends to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty’s subjects ; to promote ill-will amongst the different classes of such subjects. A person is deemed to intend the consequences following his conduct, at the time, and in the circumstances, in which words were used. (Halsbury, No. 909)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sir James Stephen (Digest, 6 Ed., p. 79) says the same; but an intention to show His Majesty has been misled or mistaken; to point errors for reformation, by lawful means; to point out (for removal) matters tending to feelings of hatred and ill-will is not a seditious intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ Sedition embraces all those practices, whether by word, deed or writing, which fall short of high treason, but directly tend to have for their object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction; to excite ill-will betw-een different classes of King’s subjects; to create public disturbance, or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred or contempt the Sovereign or the Government, the laws or constitution, and generally all endeavors to promote public disorders. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Criticism and censure are permissible, but they must be without malignity, must not impute corrupt or malicious motives, and must avoid defamation. The law only interferes when the limits are passed of frank and candid and honest discussion; (Archbold, p. 1139).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A man may discuss measures, provided he does so fairly, temperately, with decency and respect, and without imputing corrupt or improper motives. Nothing can be worse to any government than to encourage ill opinion of it, and to procure animosities as to the management of it; this has always been looked on as a crime, and no government can be safe unless it be punished. Whether the publisher intended his writings to have that effect is not material; if the publication is calculated to do so, it is seditious libel. Liability depends, not on the truth of the words used, nor in the motives of the publisher, but on the question whether the words used, having regard to the audience addressed, were calculated to promote public disorder, physical force or violence; (Archbold, p. 1140).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The seditious intent may be inferred from the libel without any extrinsic evidence of it’’; (Archbold, p. 1142, 28 Ed.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In many cases the innuendo appears so clear from the context that further proof is unnecessary, and it is left to the jury. (P. 1144)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may be tedious, but it is necessary to review the contents of the pamphlets distributed by the appellant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font9"> declares:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is impossible to elect men and expect them to enact just laws (p. 5); can the nation exist long, while such unjust conditions exist? (P. 6) Big business owns every visible thing; real estate, and the banks, to which the Government was compelled to advance $100,000,000 (pp. 7,8); the same interests control the professional clergymen, who make merchandise of the Word of God, to keep people subject to the ruling powers (9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The predatory class uses a propaganda press and its hypocritical clergymen to sound false slogans. Big Business and its strong-arm squad are reprehensible in the sight of God; but the clergymen are worse (13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan is the author and organizer of the Big Business system. He has used commerce, polities and religion, to get control of the human race (14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan and his great commercial organization, acting with false and hypocritical religious leaders, abetted by the political power, charge God with responsibility for human suffering. The clergy, claiming to represent God, represent the Devil ,(17).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan placed power in Big Business and its allies; the army, the navy and the “strong-arm squad” will do its bidding (19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">America and Britain are the leading nations of “Christendom”; yet there has been more hypocrisy practiced and more blood unrighteously shed in these than in any others under the sun (23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Both the United States and Great Britain are the cliief part of the realm of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, but Satan is their invisible ruler and god (4). Every branch of the government is contaminated and improperly influenced by Big Business (P- 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why is there great fear amongst the rulers and distress amongst the people! (P. 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American government . . . cannot endure; together with all other nations it soon shall fall, in spite of Big Business, politicians and clergymen, the military and the strongarm squad (28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Refrain from violence; wait for salvation; trust in Jehovah, whose kingdom is solely your hope (28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I charge that the clergymen, bath Catholic and Protestant, hinder the people from receiving the truth as to the real cause of the distress that is now upon the world (40).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Catholics, Protestants and Jews form a confederacy with the announced purpose to bring peace, prosperity and relief. The time to accomplish this they call <sup>1</sup> ‘ holy year ’ ’. The real purpose is to keep the people quiet for a while. The Catholics have no confidence in the Protestants, and vice versa; the Jews have no confidence in either. Big Business knows that the whole crowd is insincere. There will be greater distress (30, 33).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There will be no peace and prosperity as long as the unholy alliance of commercial and political oppressive power with hypocritical religion continues to exist (33). Prosperity and peace will not come, for it is not God’s time; their prayer God will not hear (35).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Big Business, political rulers and big churchmen have joined hands. That combine has gained control of the gold and property of the world; as instruments of Satan they have brought about oppression of the people (36).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Farmers have tilled; financial giants have grown rich by manipulation of prices; they loaned money on mortgages; then they stripped the farmers of their lands, after taking their money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The crash is certain to come, and then what? (55)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The time of crisis has now arrived, and Jehovah’s witnesses are proclaiming His name (p. 16). Rulers are now evolving great schemes, but no such schemes can pull the nation out of the present dilemma (18).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Veterans march to Washington to beg the government to feed them and their stalling children; they beg for bread and receive a stone (18).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Would revolution relieve the people! No! No man in America can lead a revolution. It would be folly. Satan, sees that Big Business retains power through the army and the navy and the “strong-arm squad”; they will do the bidding of Big Business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The millions of people who once produced the wealth that others now have, and who are without money, are crying for help. They are not crying to God; Satan has kept them blind; they are crying because they have been robbed and defrauded, and their burdens are unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The invisible and visible armies of Satan and Jehovah are assembled at Armageddon. Satan’s marshal is Gog and commands the host of invisible devils and the visible organization that is on earth under Satan (p. 20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God has recorded illustration of this great battle now approaching (22); that battle will be the worst trouble ever afflicted the world (23). Why do I state that relief will follow the downfall of “Christendom”! Because Jehovah says so (25).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American government with all other nations will fall soon, in spite of Big Business, politicians, clergymen, military and strong-arm squad, in spite of the Devil holding together oppressive rule (28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the work of the witnesses shall have been accomplished, there shall follow the worst trouble the world has ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We will obey God and not man (46), We will preach in the manner and by the means that Jehovah has provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He who opposes will do so at his peril. Let all such take warning. If officers will be tricked by hypocritical clergymen •—they must take the responsibility. Jehovah will destroy all who oppose the onward march (47).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is a cartoon in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span><span class="font9"> It depicts an angel, with buckler and sword, crashing into a company of three: a bloated capitalist (with a silk hat, a fat cigar) is impressing a crowned ruler, in a modern check-suit, with a weighty argument in the shape of a bag of dollars. On the back of the politician’s chair is the legend “In God we trust”; there is a glass on the table in front of him; a clergyman in cassock and beretta is pouring a liquid from a bottle into the glass, while the worldly gentleman blows smoke-rings skyward. The clergyman is depicted with a paunch, and a fat cigar. On the floor is a wastepaper basket, containing a dilapidated book, entitled “Holy Bible”; beside it is an uncorked bottle. The clergyman carries an umbrella, with the device “For the Economic Storm” (p. 52).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In another book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Le Roi/aume)</span><span class="font9"> (p. 8) there is another cartoon, showing the erection of ramparts, constructed of helmets, airplanes, cannon, cruisers, etc. These are being cemented with plaster, the water for which is in a watering can, bearing the inscription “Holy Water”. A Protestant clergyman (presumably) is passing a trowelful of plaster to a Catholic clergyman, standing on a ladder, and gowned in surplice and stole—both bespectacled. Army, navy, and civil representatives stand by, witnessing operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A vignette depicts the pope, during “Holy Year”, knocking on a cobwebbed door with a mallet. He carries the keys of St. Peter, and he wears his tiara ; young pages carry a long, long train. The only concourse consists of three mice. Perhaps the vermin are meant, with the cobwebs, to denote the state of decay, neglect and dilapidation into which the church has fallen. Ridicule in any event is heaped into one square inch of picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the passages noted were addressed to the American public, but they were distributed in Quebec ; these paragraphs were meant for consumption here. The utterances, distributed by the appellant and his comrades (fellow-missionaries, and self-styled witnesses of Jehovah) acting with a common design, must have been calculated to cause offence and to bring grief to large numbers of the population of Quebec. The convictions and feelings of others were entirely disregarded. The language, repeated and again repeated, is grossly insulting. Fair comment and criticism of political measures, of economic doctrines, and of religious tenets are permissible. As the authors declare, censure must be within the limits of ordinary decency. The insults offered were gross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have not stopped to see what effect the author’s teachings would have on religion. I have studied the pamphlets in the light of the law, with the sole purpose of discovering whether they are apt to sow dissension, foster hatred and animosity, and provoke unreasoned and unseasoned judgment, in our present distress, when passion should find no place. The arguments advanced by the author are clearly specious • he argues from particular cases, and claims to have established a sweeping, general conclusion that corruption, cupidity and malevolence exist in those spheres of life, on which society has always counted to maintain its structure. It does not necessarily follow, because a person has attained distinction, that he is necessarily bad. The author has clearly divided the world into two categories. He seeks to set one against the other; there may be good priests and clergymen ; there may be honest bankers; all businessmen are not miscreants. On the other hand, we are prone to suspect those who advertise their title to goodness; their assumption is their sole title.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two or three years ago, we all believed that our civilization and culture, that our economic system, were the greatest that man could evolve. The great majority of thinkers, until very recent years, would believe nothing to the contrary. Any other prophet then would have been stoned. As adversity touched us, we have discovered flaws in our structure. It is not only the author, -who discovered them; it is not Jie who discovered and disclosed cupidity and extortion. He probably would have noticed nothing had government agents and business experts themselves not made known to us the evils that beset us; the people could have known only that they lacked, not the cause of their lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Governments have been alive to the troubles of the people; it is even recognized that the troubles of the people mean eventually the ruin of their leaders, unless efforts be made to rectify conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Government and Business are aware of the difficulties of a situation, which requires careful attention. A fabric cannot be destroyed in a world of millions, unless we have something to replace it. Even the advanced thinkers and outspoken socialists of England do not advise immediate and entire change of a system ; in the meantime, no provision could be made to absorb the masses who would be displaced; these would be greater than those now out of employment; the latter are being assisted, if not generously, at least as helpfully as our financial assets will allow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the leaders in church and state and business are as corrupt as the pamphlets would have us believe, how would the author find substitutes for our institutions and our managers? Would he have us accept him and his fellow missionaries, because they tell us that they alone have absorbed the real spirit of the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Man lives in society, and a condition of his existence in society is toleration. Common sense requires it; the law sanctions it; all religions teach it. Sin is reprehensible; but the state is still interested in the sinner, who may be curbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If man has sinned believing in his system, we have all sinned, for we thought alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The logical thing to do is to find where we committed error and to correct it. Some, even many, may have taken advantage of the weakness of man’s creations; but efforts are being applied to correct abuses. They will be corrected. Necessity will hurry correction along. Can it be said that the leaders in the principal countries of the world are not alive to their difficulties, that the best minds are not grappling with solution? They need encouragement. Why preach a gospel of despair? Why assign corrupt and malign motives to acts, which many of us know are directed by a sense of duty, a feeling of brotherhood and at the personal expense of the actor. A complex system has to be overhauled; we are not dealing with primitive principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The interests of society come before every consideration. Assuming that the author’s matter was appropriate, his methods should also have been appropriate. I find them harmful. Sentiment must be disciplined ; good sense must be applied ■ a little courtesy has its place; modesty in the assumption of the title of a preacher of the Word might await a more marked indication from a higher quarter than the author’s ipse dixit, though supported by letters-patent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All parties in the State today are offering panaceas to cure ills; there are various policies; the trouble is to select, because conditions are new. We have a corrective in the ballot; our newly acquired knowledge of economics will be suggestive and beneficial. We may be floundering, but an honest effort is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The accused advance in support of their intervention in mundane, as well as spiritual affairs, the authority of the Bible; but we must take our authority from the Code, which no one can say runs counter to proper teaching. I am not now considering, I repeat, the moral or religious aspect of the matter, though the clergymen of all religions have been pilloried and placed in the stocks. I merely have to declare that I find in these pamphlets a sapping of all authority, to be replaced only by anarchy and mobrule, unless some despot should present himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To accept the teaching of the author would also encompass the unification of all churches in his. We are told to await the second coming of the Messiah. This might be satisfactory, if all were good Christians, of which fact the pamphlets express doubt. All might not have sufficient patience to maintain the woeful depicted condition until this second coming. And we are taught that good works are necessary here and now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many of these missionaries themselves, if imbued with the spirit of the writings, and with their urge of hatred, would be tempted to scourge the despoiler —and they might not discriminate. Many unbelievers would revolt at once, did they believe that justice could not be earlier served. Others would doubt the authority and the ability of these teachers to interpret the Bible; and especially would some deem that these jumbled texts have been perhaps misapplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is dangerous to incite the multitude. If proper ends are desired, the psychology of the human race is to be considered; it is not as stable as some insist; people are variously excitable; the unexpected may happen; care is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nor can it be urged that these writings are not harmful, but beneficial, because the people are told to be patient, and to await Armageddon, when the hosts of the Lord will fight for them. The Devil, we are told, may cite Scripture for his ends. The appearance of virtues may be assumed for varying purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptures inform us that the poor we shall always have. This does not indicate the futility of human endeavor. The text implies that we should not render these poorer and more numerous; that, though misfortune may overtake some, concerted action by states and individuals should bring alleviation. Texts are explanatory of others. They are addresses to people of common sense; the other kind is not responsible. The understanding of texts means discriminating selection for, and application to, a given situation. Virtues may conflict; pity and duty are not always compatible; the occasion must be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When nerves are racked, demagogues and saviors play on emotions; they let loose forces that they cannot control. The law frowns on injudicious harangues, pious or profane. It was for jurors to decide; they saw danger; their verdict so declared. The slogans and cheap witticisms (that usually provide us with a philosophy of life, and a solution for all problems) were in this case wrapped in texts; their pious exterior did not improve the contents; 1’habit ne fait pas le moine. All kind of sects, which have become outmoded, were founded on misapplied texts, perhaps by people in good faith. Born overnight, with a pseudo-divine mission, they disappeared in the mists created by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The author now blames all Christians in high places, on the authority of texts. He declares that Protestants see heresy in Catholic teachings, and vice versa, with the Hebrews sneering at both, while Big Business smiles in smug satisfaction. Christ gave a mission to His apostles to teach—not to insult and destroy, as these appellants do now, while assuming the roles of judges, theologians and statesmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is to be noted that men today do not necessarily desire change; they do want improvement; they want it now. But sudden and drastic changes would leave us nothing to distribute; we would not have organized our production. The appellant must have suspected that men would not wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To attack the eminent and distinguished today is for mediocrities a hallmark of distinction; their efforts arc in inverse ratio to their abilities. We tend to the lawlessness rampant in other realms; we may come under the rule of a self-inspired zealot, strong, because of our cynicism—capricious and tyrannical because of our weakness. This is not fantastic; others have so evolved. Crusading missionaries cultivate this cynicism, and exploit this weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No greater security is obtained by snatching power from leaders (willing to alter plans), and by vesting it in zealots, who reject all human authority (that of the people, in the end). History teaches that populations return to leadership established by the nation (in committee of the whole), and not to that of demagogues, hating one another, as they once hated the common imaginary enemy. The law wants to maintain a nation, and not a rabble; it desires no clashes of classes. Change is not to be sought for purposes of retaliation, but for improvement’s sake, which can only be attained by co-operation and universal brotherly love (a text omitted in the pamphlets). Actually the only differences existing are in the scope and method of suggested improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the appellant sought only to bring about the spiritual betterment of his fellows, why did he and his author lay most stress on the temporal activities of today, that he repeatedly execrated in vehement language; why did he especially castigate all persons in authority ? The appellant knows that all were wedded to the system. Why did he select scapegoat to be blamed for sins committed by a few, sins that were lately discovered, sins that could only have been committed because we, like appellant, did not even suspect the methods adopted and their successful operation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It appears to me that the Biblical addition to the invectives of these pamphlets is only for a cloak for the sensational and the novel. The writer knew well that he could not inveigh against order and good government; he sought to cover himself with texts. His method was an insidious attack; it was of a nature to provoke discontent and disorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The citations may be correct, but they have been misinterpreted and misapplied; the end intended would not be attained, because no one will wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The indictment of these pamphlets against all men who sought to distinguish themselves is for the worst crime that could be committed against God and humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The attack is one against &quot;Christendom”, the presently accused missionaries now seek to offer themselves as an improvement on the apostles, whose work has been a dismal failure, to be corrected by appellant and his companions. Why embellish the Bible? Was something omitted or improperly expressed? If we are to await Armageddon, why stir passions, and expose personages to execration? Was not present, direct action intended, or at least suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This sect appears to have social, political and economic ends. In the spiritual and religious sphere, it omitted charity, moderation and toleration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Passions were unbridled in other countries, under a cloak of patriotism and religion, as history tells, and results were always disastrous, until sanity assumed sway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The conclusions of these pamphlets are left in midair, the policy suggested is one of prayerful watching and waiting; passions were unnecessarily aroused, if nothing was intended, or at least suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These missionaries clamor against the persecutions of all sects of all nations; yet they do not hesitate to deliver leaders to the only martyrdom in their power: ridicule and obloquy; these they pour on those who, they think, deserve their venom. It is they, themselves, who tell us that they have been persecuted in the United States, Canada and even in England, that never refused a rostrum to any perfervid orator who presented himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I stated that they clamor against persecution, yet they declare that they seek it. They affirm that they will preach in the manner and by the means that Jehovah has provided; he who opposes will do so at his peril. This is a sample of their intentions not to submit to law and order; this is an encouragement to others to do as their judgment or an inspired mission may direct them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pamphlets tell us that the worst troubles will overtake the world, when the witnesses shall have finished their work; they and others like them are to have their assumed task blessed in the midst of the universal destruction that will follow their teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must be remarked that the churches—all the churches—rose, long before this author, to decry greed and cupidity. This is common knowledge. All governments have taken measures to restrain, but the churches and the states of the world have not decreed destruction, as a corrective. And more, both church and state everywhere want the kingdom of God on earth, and not only in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The exhortations of the author are pious vituperation and sanctimonious recrimination. He was the more dangerous because there is no cry that incites more to fury than the cry of inspired sanctity. Inspiration must be properly directed. I cannot conclude that these teachings are as altruistic as claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The accused was entitled to review the fact of the case in appeal, because he alleged that there was no evidence to justify conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The accused complained of the conviction because his arrest was illegal, having been made without a warrant. Article 648 Or. C. enacts that a peace officer may arrest without warrant any one whom he finds committing any criminal offence. This is what happened herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The jurors were entitled to judge the accused, according to their conviction, after a reading of the pamphlets; no witnesses were required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The rejection of proof of similar acts by other parties, not molested, was proper and legal; that proof would have had no bearing on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I find that no substantial wrong was done the appellant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The insulting cartoons were in themselves sufficient to convict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is the unanimous judgment of the Court. I was instructed by the Crown chief justice to render this judgment.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Another Example of Quebec “Justice” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Gerald Barry, Pioneer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE following are copies of two open letters which were recently sent to the Hon. L. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Taschereau, premier of Quebec, concerning the arrest and imprisonment of two young sisters at Ville St. Pierre, Quebec. One was sent to Taschereau by myself, and copies of it were also sent to the judge and the mayor of Ville St. Pierre. The other letter was sent to Taschereau by the mayor of Ville St. Pierre. As it was written in French, you are provided with the French original and an English translation. The letters speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An open letter to the Honorable L. A. Taschereau, Premier of the Legislative Assembly, and Attorney General of the Province of Quebec. Honorable Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You are aware of the fact that, however it may be explained, the courts of justice of the province of Quebec have in recent years been made an instrument of religious persecution. Men and women have been convicted and fined, or sentenced to a term in prison, not for any crime or wrongdoing on their part, but because they believed in the teachings of Christ, and were active in disseminating their teachings among the people. During the past week, two young Christian girls, one of whom was under eighteen years of age, who were working in Ville St. Pierre, calling at the homes of the people with literature explaining the Bible, were arrested, and were finally, in the afternoon of the same day, taken to the home of Judge Lacoix, 275 Bloomfield Ave., Outremont, and were questioned by the judge and were sentenced to ten dollars fine and costs or eight days in jail. The trial taking place at the judge’s home, the girls were not aware that they were really undergoing their trial, and for that reason attempted no defense. Their request to get in touch with their director was refused by the judge, and they are now serving their sentence of eight days in jail. There is no question but that this case is a blot upon the administration of justice in the province of Quebec. The girls will be out in a few days, but there is a principle at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To illustrate this point, I am going to quote briefly from Mr. Harai who spoke in Chicago at the Parliament of Religions in A.D. 1893. He says: “Is it the principle of civilized law that the rights and profits of so-called ‘uncivilized’ or the weaker should be sacrificed? As I understand it, the spirit and the necessity of law is to protect the rights and welfare of the weaker against the aggression of the stronger; but I have never learned in my shallow studies of law that the weaker should be sacrificed for the stronger. ... Is it Christian morality to trample upon the rights and advantages of a non-Christian nation, coloring all their natural happiness with the dark stain of injustice?” Is it not the duty of a judge to protect and deliver the innocent, as well as to condemn the guilty? If he fails to do so, is he not then failing in the performance of his duty? It is written, “He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.”—Proverbs 17:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The apostle Paul recognizes the fact that when a person believes on the Lord Jesus, he must confess Him with his mouth. His words are: “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” (Romans 10: 9) The man whom Jesus healed wished to accompany Him, but Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, “Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee. ’ ’—Mark 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But today, when two young girls who have just started to walk in the Master’s footsteps proceed to do this that Jesus said, they are thrown into jail. I recall the case of the hermit of Livry, near Paris, in the sixteenth century. Through the teachings of the Reformers, he came to know Christ as his personal Savior; filled with joy, he spoke forth the Word to all whom he met with gladness of heart. Within a short time he was arrested by the authorities, tried, and burnt at the stake for his faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If those who have constituted themselves rulers or authorities have dealt truly and justly by the followers of Christ in thus subjecting them to persecution, and if they have done right by Christ himself, who died for us all, then let them rejoice in the position which they have taken, and let the people rejoice-in them. But if not, then let God’s Word which He has spoken be fulfilled, which God spake in Deuteronomy 32:40-43: “For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. . . . Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In A.D. 1914 God placed His beloved Son Jesus upon His throne in heaven, and Satan and his angels were then east out of heaven, and down to this earth. —Revelation 11:17,18; Daniel 12:1; Psalm 2:6; Revelation 12:7-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In A.D. 1918, when the war had ended, the people were given an opportunity of accepting and welcoming God’s appointed King, and walking in His ways, or not. This, since 1918, is the true fulfillment of Palm Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The rulers of this world, and many of the people, have not welcomed God’s appointed King, and God has caused notice and warning to be served upon them by His witnesses, even as notice and warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">was served upon Pharaoh at God’s command, by Moses and Aaron. The day of God’s vengeance is now being proclaimed by God’s command throughout the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses, and shortly the manifestation of God’s wrath shall be visited upon the wicked. Then “the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power”.—2 Thessalonians 1:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. ’ ’—Psalm 2:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">April 16, 1935. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Barry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Open Letter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">[Translated from the French]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ville St. Pierre</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">24th April 1935 Monsieur, The Honorable L. A. Taschereau, Prime Minister of the Province of Quebec, Government Buildings, Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Honorable Minister:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I beg leave to address you, and to send you this answer to the letter which was sent you the 17th inst., concerning the disciples of Jehovah; the municipality of Ville St. Pierre being there specially mentioned, I believe it to be my duty to give you the other side of the question. I am in possession of a copy of the letter which was sent to you the 17th inst., by Mr. Gerald Barry, one of the disciples of Jehovah, who consider themselves sent of God to save the world. I see that the basis of his letter rests more on some extracts taken from a discourse of a certain Mr. Harai, rather than on the protestations regarding the arrest of the two young girls who were arrested here for having spread and sold harmful and destructive literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I do not wish to open here a controversy with this gentleman, because that would be taking him too seriously, and would be giving a free advertisement for the subversive ideas that his sect wishes to inculcate in our spirit in spite of us. Why does this gentleman who possesses such an evangelical zeal not go, with his brothers and sisters (as they call themselves), to the barbarous peoples of Africa and Asia? They would certainly find there a ground better prepared than ours for their radical ideas. Do they fear that their petty business would not be as flourishing as amongst us? I am astonished that the God whom they claim to follow has not sent them there, thus imitating our Catholic missionaries who fear not the real persecutions. But no, they like better to parade in automobiles, and run the risk of passing a day or two in prison in order to pass as martyrs for their cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I protest, Monsieur the Minister, against the accusation made by Mr. Barry to the effect that our courts are being used as instruments of persecution against their religion. If they have incurred the severity of our courts, it is because they have wished it, because they have sought it, and because they consider it a glory to be condemned, refusing all chances to go home in peace. Why do they have to come even to our doors to try to sell us their booklets, in order (according to their claim) to be allowed to carry on their work of salvation? And what doctrine do they wish to establish? They are not pussyfoots, for the two young girls in question, arrested in Ville St. Pierre by my orders, have naively told me that all the churches ought to be burned, and that they will certainly be some day, because that there we worship the Devil; and that the ministers and priests are frauds and hypocrites. This savors of communism, does it not, Monsieur the Minister? The two young girls in question were given full opportunity to leave Ville St. Pierre at liberty, but they would not budge, refusing to take orders from men, and declaring themselves ready to submit to martyrdom, adding that they would come back again. Sure enough, as soon as their term in prison was finished, they came back, nine or ten in all, both men and women, but this time they were not rebellious, and were sent home in quietness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Would that these enlightened ones would leave us in peace, that they would go elsewhere to spread the results of their nocturnal studies, and there get hanged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I also ask where they will place all their elect, for according to them, there are only 144,000 disciples of the elect in their heaven; ours then being much more hospitable, it is preferable that we stay as we are. Why do they go to so much trouble? Let them stay where they are, and all will be well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have the honor to be,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Monsieur, the Prime Minister,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J. A. Lachance, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mayor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">DISPATCH from Boston says: “For the third time in little more than ten years Massachusetts yesterday rejected ratification of the child labor amendment to the United States Constitution. There was not a single dissenting vote. Last week the House voted 218 to 5 against the amendment. Twice before the measure has been rejected at the behest of Roman Catholic and other clerical forces and in the face of support by organized labor.” The outstanding advocate of child labor, opposing legislation in behalf of the little folks, is Cardinal O’Connell, of Boston.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Should De the Penalty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">fTVHE Minneapolis </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font10"> June 24, 1935, has nearly three columns telling of the conspiracy between the police and the criminals of St. Paul, unearthed by the St. Paul </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News. </span><span class="font10">The headlines read: '‘Four Officers Told to Quit or Face Ax; Five Suspended; Sensational Link with Criminal Lawyers and Gambling Syndicate Bared; Police Ownership of Slot Machines Uncovered ; Five Men Suspended for Thirty Days, Including Chief M. J. Culligan; Most Drastic Department Shake-Up Follows Month of WireTapping; James Crumley, Inspector, Told to Turn in His Badge or Be Fired; 3,000 Pages of Evidence Secured Through Telephone Conversations Recorded by Dictographs and New Invention.” Readers are invited to note the names and the probable &quot;church” connections of those suspended or ordered to resign. They are, James Crumley, Fred Raash, Michael McGinnis, Ray Flanagan, M. J. Culligan, Thomas Dahill, Charles Tierney, John McGowan, Patrick Ridge. Dahill and Tierney were expected to be demoted, but allowed to return to the force. The gang cleared in the neighborhood of $2,000 a day. There was a well organized tip-off system, so that their pals in the criminal world would not get caught; eighty percent of the telephone conversations with police headquarters were between the criminals and their pals at headquarters; police and gamblers communicated with each other by a code system; lawyers were in on the conspiracy, and the cases of persons arrested were sold to the highest bidder; there were police deals with houses of prostitution. It is a safe bet that every pimp of the outfit was a member of some so-called “Holy Name” gang, members of the greatest criminal conspiracy that ever existed on earth. The worst that is proposed for these miscreants is that they should lose their jobs permanently or, more probably, temporarily. Here are men that have betrayed the interests of the taxpayers, and connived against them, and bargained with gamblers, crooked lawyers and prostitutes, and have done it in the name of law and order, and probably have done it in the name of religion, too. In view of the fact that in ancient Israel it was the law to stone or burn whores to death, one naturally wonders what penalty is properly due to pimps. It is men like this, and with names like these, and with church connections like these, that have done the will of their “religious” overlords and made the name of America to stink throughout the whole of heathendom. And the worst of it is that this gang is planning to take over the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archbishop Messmer Lays Down the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">fJIHE Italian Catholics of Kenosha, Wis., got it into their heads that they should have something to say about how their money is spent. It was therefore necessary for their archbishop, S. G. Messmer, to explain to them just what there is to the repeated claims that the Catholic church is the friend and champion of liberty. A part of what he wrote to them is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“American Catholics should understand clearly the teaching of their faith, namely, that the church is not a republic or a democracy, but a monarchy; that all her authority is from above and rests in her hierarchy ; that while the faithful of the laity have divinely given rights to receive all the blessed ministrations of the church, they have absolutely no right whatever to rule and govern. The bishop has the right and duty to govern the diocese in spiritual and temporal matters with legislative, judiciary, and coercive power, according to the rules of the Sacred Canons. It belongs to the pastor, not the trustees, to determine how and for what purposes the premises of the parish, church, or school, or hall, may be used. Hence the pastor is not the servant or hired man or employee of the congregation, but he is its boss and master or let me rather say, its father who rules the parish as a father rules his family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the same letter the poor Italians who thought they should have some liberties were given to understand that it was their job to pay and pay and pay, and that a good time for the priest to put this privilege up to them is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“when such people come to receive the sacraments, or in the ease of marriage or a funeral, or when they bring their children for baptism or first communion or holy confirmation. In such a ease the priest has a perfect right not only to expect a little gift for himself, but also to demand of these parties to pay some contribution to the parish, to pay some contribution when in compliance with their duties. When the priest does this he is not doing anything wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">FTER centuries in which the education of the people was entirely in the hands of the priests Portugal is now 65-percent illiterate.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE following letter appeared in the correspondence column of an English newspaper: </span><span class="font9">“Canon Blackburne, Dean of Bristol. Dear Dean:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—In noticing that men laughed at religion but never at Christ you have got near the reason why the churches have fallen into disfavour. Education has brought people to understand Christ’s teachings, and they are revolting, not against Him, but against the mummeries and bigotries which so many religionists preach in His name.—John Bull.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Senator Bailey's Tribute to “Father” Coughlin</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font10">N April 25 it was surprisingly warm in Washington—in the United States Senate. A Democratic administration had up for consideration an anti-lynching bill. Apparently the Democratic and Roman Catholic “Father” Coughlin had said something about it on the radio. Senator Bailey, of North Carolina, Democratic, but not Roman Catholic, was talking on the bill and happened to think of the radio priest, and this is what he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is time to have a notice, too. Some of us here in the Senate find our voices too feeble to stretch across the continent and our humble words drowned in a universal din of hysteria and confusion and the clear, patient words of national life all obliterated and obscured in the raucous noise that comes from Coughlin over the radio. Perhaps, when we cease to be heard, a bill like this will notify the nation. If I do not miss my calculations, the reverberation, if it shall, will drown the voice of Coughlin, and then we may thank God for the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I did not mean on this occasion to speak about Coughlin. I left off his title, and I did so deliberately. In his church—and I shall always speak respectfully of all churches—he can be called “Father” or “Reverend Father”; but he cannot be called “Father” or “Reverend Father” in American polities. In his church he may have his priestly robes and his power of absolution, but when he undertakes to promise a harp and a halo to the American people by political action I challenge his priestly power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is nothing more sinister in our life right now than that Coughlin from the radio of the Shrine of the Little Flower , . . that voice stirs the depths of hate throughout the land of liberty, matches class against class, foments the fires of revolution, to crucify the American people upon his damnable ambition. Coughlin! Not “Father Coughlin”. . . . When . . . a minister of a church comes down into the political arena and goes out with his radio incendiarism to stir up the fountains of hate in a distressed land amongst a suffering people, I take it nothing amiss, and I make no apologies, but I will snatch the halo from his brow and throw it into the nearest spittoon, and then throw the spittoon into the gutter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judas to Get His Thirty Pieces</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ATHOLIC Action is now well launched in New Jersey. The opening gun -was at a so-called “Holy Name Communion Breakfast”, held at Passaic, N. J., April 7,1935. The two-column report in the Passaic </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-News</span><span class="font10"> is confusing. One boast is that 860 took communion; the other is that there were 300 at the breakfast to hear the pleas for what was designated as “New Catholic Action”. What that action will be is well known to Jehovah God and to His witnesses. Mr. Moriarty was one of the speakers. Listed as “superintendent of the Wallington public schools”, he must have made a thrilling address, as the pope has repeatedly, over and over again, denounced the public schools. Probably he has a job with the hierarchy looking after one or more parochial schools, but big titles are essential, to put anything across. He said, “The keystone of modern society is the church.” The pope has made it clear that as soon as the Catholic “church” gets strong enough it intends to put Protestants to death; so Moriarty, of course, meant only the “church” that engineered the massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day. Deputy Mayor Kelly is the title given to somebody; the title sounds fishy. But, anyway, Mr. Kelly said, “This is truly an age of Catholic action,” and, “Ours is a religion of authority and not one of private convictions.” Protestants may take note of this, or have it rammed down their throats a little later. As to the liberties of members of the flock of the “church” with which he is connected, Mr. Kelly explained his condition by saying, “We cannot read certain publications, because the church wishes to safeguard our faith and our morals.” Now if that were in Mexico, and back of 1910, Mr. Kelly could have proudly said, “Only 15 percent of us Mexicans can read at all. The reason is that the Roman Catholic church has had undisputed sway here for four hundred years, and it does not dare to let the common people see how they have been lied to and deceived.” In conclusion it may be added that while that is not their conscious objective, yet the Roman hierarchy aims at exactly the same situation as it attained by four hundred years’ unrestricted use of tyrannical and unprincipled domination of everything in Mexican life. Thanks were extended to Protestants for helping to make the meeting a success. Judas will get his thirty pieces of silver, all right, but he won’t be able to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pope’s Soldiers Had on Their Shakos</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE pope is strong for peace; he says so himself. That is why he has three kinds of soldiers. “Onward, Christian soldiers.” “In time of peace prepare for war.” How will anybody know a ruler is for peace unless he has soldiers? Readers of the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> had a chance to read over a column about what went on in the pope’s little kingdom on Easter Sunday. One of the items said: “Noble and Swiss guards and papal gendarmes, armed with sabers and rifles, and wearing the plumes, shakos and patent boots of a bygone military era, were posted at portals and aisles from dawn.” The shako, it should be explained, is a stiff hat, on the order of a plug, but bigger at the top, and stiffened with a brass or other metal plate. The intent is to keep the wearer’s head intact and free from all danger of bullets or ideas or other dangerous things that might be flying through the air. However, it is really not needed in Vatican City; certainly not by the kind of men that wore them; and absolutely not on one of the three days in which the pope himself said everybody should pray for peace. By the way, at those three days of prayers for peace at the Lourdes grotto, it speaks of the lights which gleamed from the silver helmets of the Vatican officers, and cannon that roared in salute to the legate of Pius XI, all of which seems very appropriate to the occasion, especially when considering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">zcho</span><span class="font10"> were praying for peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Clear About Reverend Murphy</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">J. O’Neill, architect, of Whitehall, Bally-• castle, Ireland, sued for £1,105 due for services in connection with the erection of a convent. The Reverend Bernard Canon Murphy was to have answered that Mr. O’Neill had agreed to take his pay in prayers, and then Mr. Murphy had the bad luck to die before the case came to trial, and nobody could locate him, on account of the dust and smoke, and it is not known whether his prayers are of any good in the place where he is. It seems, according to the best Roman Catholic theologians, that Mr. Murphy is due to cook for at least 1,000 years, and it is hard to pray for others while one is cooking. Under the circumstances it looks as if O’Neill would get no prayers for 1,000 years, and by that time he won’t need them. Everybody will have forgotten about the whole ridiculous arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eucharistic Red-Light Annex</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">rp HE ORE TIC ALLY, the Holy Name Society -*• has as one of its objectives the suppression of immorality, but it seems that when the big Eucharistic show of the little piece of bread was made at Melbourne, and it was necessary for the Roman hierarchy to make a big show in a Protestant land, desperate measures were necessary to get everybody in line for the big parade. George Bennett, Jr., of New Zealand, states the facts in the following communication:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Reading recently an article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font9">touching on illiteracy in Catholic countries, makes me wonder what the immorality rate is in these same countries. During my travels I could not help noticing the large numbers of street women in places like Spain, Italy, South America and other Catholic strongholds. It is perfectly obvious that the confessional is to blame for this. Ambrose and his racketeers have very cunningly made all these sins the washable variety, providing the women have the long green that goes with it. Here is an instance: During the Eucharistic Congress at Melbourne a number of visitors went around to the red-light district to call on their favorites. Imagine their surprise when the girls told them to come back later, as they were ordered to attend the procession and no one was excused. Some religion!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ambrose and His Go-Cart</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE real hero of history is not Little Boy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Blue with his tin horn, blowing about the sheep in the meadow and the cows in the corn. That is all a take-off. The real figure is Ambrose. When he gets up into his go-cart and the cardinals and bishops and other big guns pick him up and start down the aisle there is something doing every minute. He puts it all over Little Boy Blue and gets away with it, hands down. In place of a tin horn he has six silver trumpets to tell everybody to hunt their holes, for he is on his way. They had. better get out, for he has soldiers, not the little tin ones Little Boy Blue played with, but almost the real thing; some grenadiers, some Swiss guards, some ‘noble’ guards. But the grand sight is the go-cart, the sedia gestatoria. No go-cart that Little Boy Blue was ever trundled in can compare with the grand sight of seeing the pope in his white night-gown climbing up on his portable throne and then being carted all around the place. ‘Oh, ring the bells, and blow the horns, and bring the white flabelli out; shout “Papa!” till the lisping ones give back their cradle shout.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collusion Between Vatican and Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">T IS interesting to see how the world's politicians work together to bamboozle the people. Sir Charles Wingfield was appointed minister to the Vatican. The reason why he was selected was that he was a descendant of Sir Thomas Moore, whom the pope intended to make into a ‘'Class I Saint”. When the announcement was made that Sir Thomas and Cardinal Fisher would be made over into saints, about 2,000 persons were present. They kissed the pope’s foot. The account does not say whether Sir Charles Wingfield was one of the kissers, but he probably was. After the saints had been made the pope blessed the British Empire and reminded them of their ancient faith, a part of which, of course, is kissing the pope’s foot. The pope said that the two new saints would be invited to the Royal Jubilee celebrations in England, but forgot to say that they would be unable to attend on account of being dead and in their graves, quietly asleep, awaiting the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Sure About the English Saints</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THE regular rule is that before anybody is made a “Class I Saint” he must have performed at least two miracles after his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Please do not ask how anybody could know what a man does after he is dead: that would be lack of faith. In the case of the only two English saints canonized since the days of Henry VIII, namely, Sir Thomas Moore and Cardinal Fisher, it was decided to make them saints without waiting for the miracles. This seems like a good idea: first, because it takes so long to make saints out of the British, and, second, because the British are so inquisitive and would have to have good proof that there were any miracles at all before they would believe a word of it. That the raw material was very tough for Italians to work with was proved by the fact that the ceremonies took 5% hours, but in the apostle Paul’s time it did not take that many seconds, as all his epistles bear eloquent testimony. See, for example, Ephesians 1:1, Philippians 1:1, Colossians 1:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SEEKING KNOWLEDGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup> Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil.”—Prov. 3: 5-7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH repeatedly admonishes his sons to seek and gain knowledge. He has caused to be recorded the expression of his will in order that his sons might be supplied with knowledge in time of great need. That time is the present, and it is with comfort the remnant often read: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. ’ ’—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The apostle expressed his keen desire for the welfare of his brethren by praying to God that they might be ‘filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, and that they might increase in the knowledge of God’. (Col. 1: 9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10) </span><span class="font4">Well knowing that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus must suffer great opposition, the apostle in writing to such no doubt had in mind these timely statements of God’s Word, to wit: “Through knowledge shall the just be delivered.” (Prov. 11:9) “The prudent are crowned with knowledge.” (Prov. 14:18) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“A </span><span class="font4">wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge in-creaseth strength.” (Prov. 24:5) Constantly the remnant feel the need of strength in this time of great evil in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Among the messages recorded in ancient days to supply knowledge and strength to the remnant at the present time, is the prophecy uttered by Habak-kuk; and in this and subsequent issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> the prophecy of Habakkuk will be considered. The name “Habakkuk” means “clasper”, that is, clasper of the hands or in embrace; or love’s “embrace”. The same Hebrew word is used and rendered “embrace” in the following texts: “A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.” (Ecel. 3: 5) “His right hand doth embrace me.” (Cant. 2: 6) “His right hand should embrace me.”—Cant. 8:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘Jehovah brings to the knowledge of his remnant, which he has taken out for his name, an understanding of his prophetic word just at the proper time, that their needs might be supplied and that they m’ght grow strong in the Lord. Now the Lord Jesus has returned and gathered his own unto himself at the temple of Jehovah, and therefore the remnant have come into the embrace of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is for their safety and comfort. The advocacy and comfort of the holy spirit is now ceased, because Christ Jesus himself is with his own and he is the comforter. (John 14: 1-3, 16, 17, 26) Now God’s remnant have come to a “unity of the faith, and of the knowledge [of the office and work] of the Son of God”. (Eph. 4:13, 14) Now they see that they must stand together, and all of the faithful do stand firmly as one man, proclaiming the truth in love. In connection with the comforting message that comes to God’s people the apostle admonishes: “Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus; that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Rom. 15:5, 6) This unity in Christ is the blessed condition in which the remnant now find themselves, and in this blessed state the Lord continues to feed them upon spiritual food convenient for them. (Prov. 30:8) As we consider the many wonderful truths which the Lord has given to his people during the past few years we greatly rejoice and give thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. We have come to know and fully appreciate the fact that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are our Teachers; and for that reason there is no more any occasion to be in doubt as to whether or not we are in the right way. (Isa. 30:20) The remnant do not lean to their own understanding, nor to the understanding of any other creature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Our Teachers know what things we have need of, and these needs God through Christ graciously provides. The witnesses of Jehovah are yet in the organism of flesh, and in themselves they know there is no strength and they cannot rely upon themselves. The remnant fear God. “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.” (Ps. 103:13, 14) As it is necessary for the human organism to have a certain amount of material</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">nourishment, so it is necessary for the mind constantly to feed upon the spiritual food of God’s Word. Without feeding upon this the remnant would not be able to continue following after Christ. Certainly that is the reason our heavenly Father continues to feed his children. Now the remnant understand that the great question for determination is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. But they must constantly have in mind the things necessary for the remnant to do in order to maintain their own integrity and have a part in the vindication of God’s holy name. Without such spiritual food they would become weak, faint, and would fall away. The Scriptures were written aforetime for the very purpose of furnishing the man of God with the things that he needs and must have. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Some who claim to be followers of Christ Jesus harshly criticize </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for continuing to publish something about the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, the taking out of the world a people for God’s name, and the witness work, and often say in substance: “We are tired of hearing so much about those things. Why not give us something else?” The answer thereto is that our Father knows the needs of his children and he has recorded in his Word time and again the things that are necessary for his children to keep in mind. He has not merely stated a fact once, but through the various prophecies he has stated the same things many times and from many angles. Our Father does everything right. Since God has put these great truths in his Word, the only proper course for his children is to continue to feed upon them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has no desire or inclination to publish the learning and wisdom of men, but, on the contrary, its pages are devoted exclusively to the publication of what is in the Word of God, placed there for the aid and comfort of his people. If it were unnecessary for God’s people to have an understanding of the prophecies, they would not have been recorded in the Bible. The fact that they were recorded in Holy Writ is conclusive proof that the remnant must now learn of them and be diligent to get an understanding thereof, because there will be no occasion to seek an understanding of these prophecies after Satan’s organization is gone and the kingdom of righteousness is in full control of the world. If it pleases God to continue to show his witnesses that they are pursuing the right course and he docs so by unfolding to them the prophecies which he caused to be written, then the remnant will continue to receive such information with much joy and thanksgiving. If we find one prophet corroborating another, then we may know that such corroborative testimony is essential for the welfare of God’s people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Now clasped in the embrace of the Lord Jesus at the temple, standing united as one man in Christ and armed in the holy cause of righteousness, the remnant turns to the examination of the prophecy uttered by Habakkuk. That prophecy opens with the words: “The burden [the oracle, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font4"> margin; prophecy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser]</span><span class="font4"> which Habakkuk the prophet did see.”— Hab. 1:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> This prophecy is a pronouncement against God's enemies who are this day warring against the remnant. Habakkuk in that prophecy represented the faithful remnant now on the earth; and the remnant now have a vision of the fulfillment of Habakkuk’s prophecy, and, applying the prophecy to the physical facts, which stand out clearly and without contradiction, the remnant know that they have the proper understanding of the prophecy. It was about 1932 that it pleased God to begin to expose the conspiracy of the Devil and his prince Gog and to then give his faithful remnant an understanding thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> About 1922 the organized witness work in the cause of our Lord got under way, and as that work has continued to increase with vigor and intensity the persecution has grown worse against the remnant. Naturally one might reason, and many of God’s people have so reasoned, in this manner: If the chief purpose of Jehovah is the vindication of his name, and the Lord Jesus has come to the temple and has begun judgment and he is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, then why should the Lord permit his faithful representatives in the earth to be pressed hard by the enemy? Suppose there had been nothing written aforetime and recorded in the Scriptures relating to this very matter of persecution, what would have been the result? Doubts would have arisen in the minds of the remnant, and many would have concluded ultimately that they were wrong and following in the wrong way, and would have become discouraged and have fallen easy victims to the assaults of Satan and his allies. Many of those who had consecrated themselves to do the will of God, but who failed to avail themselves of the privilege God has granted to his children, later failed to see and appreciate the truth that the Lord Jesus is at the temple and that the paramount question is the vindication of Jehovah ’s name; and such have fallen away to the enemy and become persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah foreknew that such condition would arise, and therefore he caused to be written aforetime in the Scriptures the very things that apply to the present condition and which the remnant now need for their comfort, that they may with patience continue in longsuffering and grow strong in hope. Here again is the manifestation of the loving-kindness of our God toward those who sincerely serve him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> As the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses continues they propound questions similar to those uttered in the cry of Habakkuk: “0 Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!” (Ilab. 1:2) This cry of Habakkuk shows that there would be violent and lawless opposition to the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom and that Jehovah’s witnesses would suffer violence at the hands of the lawless. The physical facts that have come to pass during the few years just passed, and which persist, show conclusively that the cry of the prophecy had reference to the present time, when Jehovah’s witnesses are diligent in proclaiming the truth of and concerning God's name and his kingdom under Christ. The facts in fulfillment of the prophecy make it now possible to understand it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The cry is for Jehovah to clear his name by establishing righteous conditions on the earth in the place and stead of oppressive, cruel and lawless conditions which now interfere with the free course of the truth. The words of the prophecy show that the crying is apparently in vain and without being heard for a time, which shows that the enemies are for some time permitted to keep up hostilities against the remnant without interference from Jehovah. Is it not true that many have propounded the question during the past few years to this effect: How long shall we have to suffer at the hands of the clergy and others of the enemy, who persecute us for telling the truth ? Will not God hear our cries and lay his restraining hand on the enemy and let us go forward without interruption in his work ? Is it wrong or showing lack of faith for the remnant to have asked such questions or to make such observations? The answer must be, It is not wrong nor even improper, for the reason that God foretold that his faithful ones would utter such cries to him and that he would comfort their hearts by increasing their knowledge. Foreknowing that such conditions would arise God caused to be recorded these words, which apply at the present time, to wit: ‘ ‘ Keep not thou silence, 0 God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, 0 God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font4"> from being a nation: that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.”— Ps. 83:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VIOLENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“For several years after the coming of the Lord to the temple many of the consecrated were under the impression that Satan was bound. Then God revealed to his people that Satan is not bound, but is very active in his endeavor to destroy the remnant; that his chief officer is Gog, who has organized the invisible and visible forces of wickedness and has formed a conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses and now commits overt acts against the anointed of the Lord. During the past few years the enemies have continued their violent assaults upon the Lord’s anointed. Chief amongst the visible wicked ones is the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which has given instructions to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, and as a result violence is inflicted upon the remnant in almost every country of “Christendom”. In Italy, Austria and Germany the anointed are subjected to all manner of assaults. In Germany the faithful are thrown into prison and violently beaten because they have in possession the Word of God or because they attempt to speak of God’s kingdom and inform others about the loving-kindness of our God. The province of Quebec is completely dominated by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, whose agents there violently persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. These are charged with sedition, ill-treated, and imprisoned because they carry the message of God’s kingdom to the people, who really desire to know of the goodness of Jehovah. In New Jersey and other parts of the United States during the past few years hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses have repeatedly been arrested, assaulted and imprisoned and otherwise ill-treated because they tell the truth to the people of and concerning the kingdom of God. In fact, in every nation of “Christendom” Jehovah’s witnesses are hated and are ill-treated. Because of the continued and increasing violence against Jehovah’s witnesses many of the consecrated have been perplexed and have asked, Why should such violence be permitted by the Lord now upon those who are faithfully doing their best to maintain their integrity toward the Lord God? Let us suppose that the Lord had revealed no truth to his people since 1914, or even since 1924; what would have been the result to the consecrated in the light of such continued violence against them? Without a doubt some, if not all, would have become completely discouraged and lost all hope. Jehovah has in substance said to his people: I knew the time would come when much violence would be shown against you, and have caused my prophets to record that which would be of aid and comfort to you in this time of stress, and now I make it known to you and reveal to you the meaning of the prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Instead of permitting his “hidden ones” to remain in perplexity and in doubt as to the reason for the violence heaped upon them, God has made it known to them that the old Dragon, Satan, not only is active but is putting forth his strongest efforts to destroy those who give the testimony of Jesus Christ in obedience to God’s commandments (Rev. 12:17); that the enemies of God’s people are numerous and are made up of a host of wicked angels and the clergy and “the man of sin” and other dupes, who do the bidding of Satan, and that this multitude of enemies will continue to violently assault Jehovah’s witnesses. Seeing, then, that Ilabakkuk represented the anointed remnant, the prophecy of God put the words in the mouth of the remnant, who now say to Jehovah: “I . . . cry out unto thee of violence”; which violence and malicious hatred continue to increase. Such a cry does not constitute a complaint against the Lord, but the condition that induces such cries causes the anointed to inquire as to the reason for such persecution; and diligently inquiring they learn that Jehovah foretold these very things by causing his prophet to put these words in the mouth of the faithful, to wit: ‘'Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font4"> with hatred of violence]. 0 keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.”—Ps. 25:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>w</sup> With propriety then we ask, How would it have been possible for the remnant to maintain their integrity toward the Lord God if Satan had been bound prior to now and there had been no assaults upon God’s people? Job maintained his integrity under great stress, and that foreshadows that the remnant must do the same thing. The remnant must withstand the enemy; therefore says the scripture: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom.”—Acts 14:22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> This part of the prophecy proves that the cries </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the consecrated unto God because of the violence heaped upon them have not been displeasing to him. God caused his prophets aforetime to record the words that apply to the consecrated at the end of the world, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">knowledge and understanding of which now gives to the remnant courage, strength and hope, and among these precious things are the following, to wit: “Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty [violence].” (Ps. 27:12) “False witnesses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font4"> witnesses of wrong] did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not. They rewarded me evil for good, to the spoiling of my soul.” (Ps. 35:11, 12) “Deliver me, 0 Lord, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font4"> man of violences]; which imagine mischiefs </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">their heart: continually are they gathered together for war. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Keep me, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font4">Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.” (Ps. 140:1-4) These and like precious texts were written aforetime for the learning of the anointed remnant, and a knowledge and understanding now enables the anointed to maintain their integrity toward God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INIQUITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The religionists of “Christendom”, particularly the clergy and the “man of sin” class, wholly disregard the law of God by which they profess to be governed, and they are given over to iniquity or lawlessness. Jehovah’s witnesses, beholding such lawlessness, have been greatly perplexed, and as Habakkuk inquired, so the remnant have inquired of the Lord: “Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[Hebrew:</span><span class="font4"> wearing effort; toil; worry] ? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.” (Hab. 1:3) Jehovah hates lawlessness and “all [the] workers of iniquity”. (Ps. 5:5) Why, then, does he permit such to continue their wicked practices ? and why should the remnant continuously come in contact with these workers of iniquity and be worried in mind and body by them? The fact that Habakkuk made such inquiry proves that those of the temple class would make a like inquiry; and such inquiry leads the anointed to ascertain the reason for such iniquity’s being practiced. Without a question of doubt such workers of inquity are without any knowledge and understanding of God’s purpose. “Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.” (Ps. 28: 3) “For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.” (Isa 32: 6) “Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.” (Ps. 14:4) “None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. ’ ’—Isa. 59:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> The present-day workers of iniquity “raise up strife and contention ’ ’, and continue to work violence and bring about the destruction of those who seek to do what is right. “Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. ” (Hab. 1:4) Thus the prophet describes the condition and attitude of these workers of violence. The law here mentioned is not the law that men have made, but the divine law, to which the workers of iniquity profess to be subject but take a course exactly contrary to what the law commands. These workers of iniquity never do justice, and “justice cometh not forth victorious”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser) </span><span class="font4">Justice is perverted, and unrighteous judgments are rendered. Such were the conditions existing in the land of Judah shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem by Jehovah’s executioner. Those conditions then existing exactly correspond with the conditions of the present day, particularly with reference to Jehovah’s witnesses and their work in the land of “Christendom” immediately preceding the overthrow of “Christendom” at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1T</sup> The prophecy of Habakkuk is then addressed to the members of “organized religion” in the nations of “Christendom” and as a warning from Jehovah, which warning “Christendom” will not heed. “Behold ye among the heathen [nations], and regard, and wonder marvellously [behold and be astonished and astounded, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser;</span><span class="font4"> look around, yea, stand stock still, stare, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham]</span><span class="font4">: for I will work a work in your days [I am working a work in your days, .A..R.V’.], which ye will not believe, though it be told you. ’ ’—Hab. 1: 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1S</sup> “Christendom” will not believe this prophecy. Then why is this part of the prophecy directed against “Christendom”, since it is not for the benefit of “Christendom”? Hypocritical “Christendom” claims to be God’s organization. Because sailing under the name “Christian”, they think that God will not bring any calamities upon them. In the “day of his preparation” God does a preparatory work, which work is done before Armageddon and in which the remnant have a part. The remnant must now deliver the message of warning to “Christendom” in order that the hypocritical nations may be put on notice and have no excuse to say they did not have an opportunity to hear, and in order that those people of good will within the borders of “Christendom” may hear and flee to the place of refuge. The ruling factors of “Christendom” will not hear, and hence are not ‘marked in their foreheads’; but those who do hear are thus marked. (Ezek. 9:1-4) Because the ruling factors of “Christendom” fail or refuse to believe or obey God, such don the garments by which they identify themselves with the Devil and his organization and thereby mark themselves for destruction.—2 Ki. 10: 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1 #</sup> This application of the text is made certain and correct by the apostle Paul. Addressing those at Antioch of Pisidia he said: “Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.” (Acts 13:40, 41) The present-day “brain trust” of “Christendom” not only ignore the law of God, but set up their own rule, by which they claim to control the world, and the clergy participate therein and bless it with uplifted unclean hands. Professing to be servants of God, and hence claiming to be Jews or Judeans, they are in fact of the synagogue of Satan. Their brains and united efforts will not stand against the mighty work of God, who says: “Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29: 14) This “marvellous work” will be at the great battle of the day of God Almighty, and no unrighteousness shall stand. “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibcon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.”—Isa. 28:21; Ezek. 3:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> In the time of Habakkuk the people of Judah were the professed people of God. Today “Christendom” occupies the place of God’s professed people. The prophecy then tells how Jehovah will raise up his Executioner against his professed people. “Christendom” has broken her implied covenant with God; hence Jehovah, through his prophet, says: “For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.” (Hab. 1:6) The Chaldeans picture Christ Jesus the Executioner, who acts at the command of Jehovah and who is in command of the army of the Lord. God’s Executioner is “bitter” against the detainers of Jehovah’s name, as Ezekiel was after reading Jehovah’s judgment: he “went bitter, in hot anger of my spirit”. (Ezek. 3: 14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font4"> “That bitter and hasty nation” (impetuous nation, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser)</span><span class="font4"> is God’s holy nation, which shall vindicate his name under the leadership of Christ Jesus. That nation makes haste or speed in executing Jehovah’s judgment, moving with swiftness like unto Jehu. (Mal. 3:5) Addressing antitypieal Israel, to wit, “Christendom,” Jehovah by Moses said: “The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young.”—Deut. 28: 49, 50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah’s Executioner ‘marches through the breadth of the land’, not only through “Christendom”, but through all the nations of the earth, as the Chaldeans did. (Jer. 25:9-11, 26) The “dwellingplaces” of “Christendom” are parts of Satan’s organization which must be destroyed, and Christ Jesus will destroy them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The army of the Lord will be terrible and dreadful to Satan’s host. “They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.” (Hab. 1:7) God’s holy nation is the “worst of the nations”, which he will bring against Satan’s organization. (Ezek. 7: 24, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> “Thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.” (Ps. 45:4) “0 God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.” (Ps. 68:35) “He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 76:12) Such will be the “great and dreadful day of the Lord”.—Mal. 4:5; Joel 2:11, 31; Dan. 9:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The Chaldeans were merely the instruments of Jehovah to execute his judgment; and at Armageddon Christ Jesus will execute Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s forces. (Ps. 149: 9; Ezek. 16: 38-41;23: 22-24) The time having come for the execution of his judgment against Satan’s host, Christ will go forth to the work. In doing his work the Lord asks and receives no dignity. Likewise his followers are in no wise dignified by the enemy. Jehovah’s witnesses, as followers of Christ Jesus, do not apply for permission or a license to be issued by “Christendom’s” officials to do the work with which Jehovah dignifies them. Those who love Jehovah obey him, and not man.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">** To be strong in the Lord one must be strong in faith. One lacking a knowledge and understanding does not possess the basis for strength of faith, because faith comes by receiving an understanding of the Word of God. When faith is weak hope grows dim and doubts crowd in. “Hope deferred maketh the heart sick • but when the desire eometh, it is a tree of life.” (Prov. 13: 12) To some of the consecrated it may seem to be a long time since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple; and since persecution by the enemy continues against them, those of less faith begin to doubt and to make inquiry. The prophecy of Habakkuk 1: 6-11 appears to be the answer of the Lord given to such inquiries, and gives assurance that Jehovah will destroy the wicked by the army of Christ and this he will do in his own due time. The opposing armies are lining up for the war. Horses symbolize war equipment, and the prophecy refers to the Arm of the Lord, Jesus Christ, in these words: “Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.” (Hab. 1: 8) Armageddon may seem to be far away, but we should keep in mind that Jehovah is not slack concerning the business of the execution of his judgment upon the wicked, as some men count slackness. (2 Pet. 3: 9) “Christendom” thinks Armageddon is too remote, if it ever comes at all, to even warrant serious consideration, and this is due to the unsound advice given by the clergy. The “Faithful and True” on his war mount, followed by his armies in heaven, will leap forward to the battle against Satan’s organization, and particularly “Christendom”, and nothing can withstand the onward rush of that army. (Rev. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">19: 11-14) </span><span class="font4">God’s holy nation is a “hasty nation” and moves with the swiftness of the eagle. (Deut. 28: 49) “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. ”—Zeph. 1: 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Jehovah gives expression to his judgment against “Christendom” with great force and violence: “They shall come all [of them] for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.” (Hab. 1: 9) From time to time it is recorded that some of the “wise” ex-elders declare that Armageddon is many years away, and some of them say it will not be fierce. On the contrary, the Scriptures show that the battle of Armageddon will be real destruction, and the most extensive and complete destruction that will ever have come to pass.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The word “wind” appearing in Habakkuk 1:9 is an interpolation. The A.R.V. reads: “The set of their faces is forwards.” (See also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser,</span><span class="font4"> margin.) The correct meaning seems to be in harmony with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">prophecy of Ezekiel’s description of Jehovah’s organization, that the armies of the Lord turn neither to the right nor to the left, but go forward to destroy the city. (Ezek. 1: 12; 43: 3) “The captivity as the sand” refers to the host of Gog, which is a great and “mighty army”. (Ezek. 38: 3, 4, 9, 15) These were also forshadowed by the Midianites, which “lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were . . . as the sand by the sea side for multi-' tude”. (Judg. 7: 12; 6: 5) The captives are not taken to detention camps as war prisoners, but are gathered for destruction. The people in “Christendom” who are of good will, and who are called Jonadabs, do not need to be taken captive. They voluntarily flee to God’s organization in obedience to the admonition given by the Lord Jesus Christ.—Luke 21: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The “kings” and “princes” are the chief rulers of the earth and those closely associated with them. Such now are proud, haughty, and look with scorn upon Christ and those who follow in his footsteps. “And they [the armies of the Lord] shall scoff at the kings [and they will make sport with kings, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser],</span><span class="font4"> and the princes shall be a scorn unto them [princes are a derision, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.;</span><span class="font4"> princes will be a play unto them, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser]</span><span class="font4">; they shall deride every strong hold; fcr they shall heap dust, and take it.”—Hab. 1: 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The clergy of “Christendom” regard the political and commercial rulers as though they were heaven’s favorites. It is these kings and princes, together with the clergy, that have conspired against the Lord and his anointed, and, says Jehovah, he will laugh at them and have them in derision. (Ps. 2: 2-5) The Lord will bring these kings and princes to nothing. (Isa. 40: 23) “He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 76: 12) “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.”—Pss. 110: 5; 68: 12, 14; Isa. 24: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Satan’s visible organization has many apparent strongholds, such as the League of Nations, peace treaties, trusts, monopolies, super-banks, dictators, church unions, Roman Catholic hierarchy, and such like, which strut about and boast of their great power and strength. All of these are a joke, when compared with the ‘ all power in heaven and in earth ’ committed unto the King, Christ Jesus, the mighty warrior. (Matt. 28: 18) No earthly or devilish stronghold will be able to hold out against the assault made by the armies of the Lord. Certainly God’s purpose is that his remnant keep these things in mind at all times, that they may now be strong in faith and bright in hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> “Christendom” now assumes that Christ Jesus supports her; and on the surface this claim appears to be true to many; but remember that Armageddon is near and all of Satan’s stronghold shall fall. “Then shall his [the executioner’s] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend [Hebrew, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ah-sham],</span><span class="font4"> imputing this his power unto his god.” (Hab. 1: 11) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font4"> reads, “Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, even he whose might is his god.” Jehovah by Christ Jesus will make a whirlwind-finish of “Christendom” at Armageddon. “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.” (Rom. 9: 28) (See Jeremiah 4:11-13.) The Lord will be very offensive to unfaithful “Christendom”, and thus will “offend”, or “be guilty” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.).</span><span class="font4"> “In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[ah-sham;</span><span class="font4"> the same word rendered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">offend</span><span class="font4"> in Habakkuk 1:11], and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.”—Ezek. 6: 6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> If an earthly general wins a battle, he claims the credit for it, even though he may be far in the rear. Christ will give glory and credit to his Father, Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> renders this part of the eleventh verse of the prophecy: “This his violence is due to his god.” “This is the strength of my God.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Septu-agint)</span><span class="font4"> The credit for the victory at Armageddon will be given to Jehovah. (Ps. 110: 5) “For the battle is not yours, but God’s.” (2 Chron. 20: 15) It is Jehovah, the almighty God, that is to be vindicated; hence he backs up with his unlimited power his beloved Son, executing his orders to the vindication of his name. David, a type of Christ Jesus, said (and his words now apply to Christ): ‘ ‘ Thine, 0 Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, 0 Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.”—1 Chron. 29: 11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> With increased knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purpose Habakkuk, that is, the modern-day remnant class, is comforted and increased in hope, and with patience continues in well-doing; and now the remnant speaks with complete confidence in adoration for Jehovah: “Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font4">Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font4">mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.” (Hab. 1: 12) Satan’s organization has existed for a long while, but Jehovah is from old, that is, without beginning, and the remnant implicitly trust in the Most High. “For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.” (Ps. 74; 12) For their encouragement it is written: “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” (Deut. 33:27) The vision of the remnant is now bright, and they say, as in this text and in Psalm 118: 17: “I shall not die [at the hands of the wicked], but live, and declare the works of Jehovah. ’ ’—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Habakkuk says that Jehovah has &quot;ordained them for judgment”, that is to say, the Chaldeans, to carry out his judgment; and those words foretell that now the remnant truly say: ‘0 Jehovah, thou hast ordained Christ to carry out the judgment work upon “Christendom” at Armageddon.’ (John5: 22-27) God has also ordained the wicked to be destroyed. (Gen. 3: 15; Ex. 9: 16; 2 Pet. 2:9) The words of Habakkuk are: “Thou hast established them for correction.” “He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct [those of 'Christendom’ w<sup>r</sup>ho hear and obey] ?” (Ps. 94: 10) Jehovah will convince all that he is the only mighty Judge, who is able to save and to destroy. (Jas. 4: 12) The remnant now know this, and they rejoice as they increase in knowledge.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> For centuries Jehovah has beheld evil, but not with approval. “The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.” (Prov. 15: 3) Habakkuk then, and the remnant now, anxious to see the name of Almighty God vindicated and the wicked destroyed, says: “Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity; wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and boldest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?” (Hab. 1: 13) Likewise Jeremiah, who also pictured the remnant of today, asked Jehovah that he might propound some questions. “Righeous art thou, 0 Lord, when I plead with thee; yet let me talk with theeof thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?” (Jer. 12: 1) Concerning “Christendom”, the rulers of which now wickedly persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, the prophet Jeremiah says: “Thou hast planted them; yea, they have taken root: they grow; yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. But thou, 0 Lord, knowest me; thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee; pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.” (Jer. 12:2, 3) “Christendom” has dealt treacherously against Jehovah by becoming a part of Satan’s organization, and thus has begotten strange children. (Hos. 5: 7; 6: 7) “Christendom” now enters into a conspiracy against the Lord and his people, and expects to get away with it; but their treachery is exposed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> Habakkuk, after calling attention to the treachery, tries to get the right view of the matter and asks: ‘And boldest thou thy tongue [peace, R.P.] when the wieked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he?’ Ancient Jerusalem was more wieked than Sodom, and likewise “Christendom” is more wicked than the heathen nations. Habakkuk was striving to keep his integrity toward God, and likewise the remnant now do the same thing; hence the reference is to the remnant as “more righteous”, not “holier than thou”, in justification of self; but, judging each side by their fruits, the remnant know that “Christendom” stands for and holds forth the message of the Devil, while the remnant hold forth the fruits of the kingdom and for that reason they are on the right side. Therefore the remnant prays: “Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. For they speak not peace; but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha! our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">eye</span><span class="font4"> hath seen it. This thou hast seen, 0 Lord; keep not silence: 0 Lord, be not far from me. Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.” (Ps. 35: 19-23) “Hold not thy peace, 0 God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful, are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.” (Ps. 109: 1-3) Such is the proper attitude of the remnant; otherwise God would not have caused these texts to be set forth in his Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Continuing to speak of the wicked who oppress the harmless, the prophecy of Habakkuk says: “And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?” (Hab. 1: 14) Particularly the clergy of “Christendom” assume that they are the favored ones and that God is giving no protection to the remnant; therefore the wicked hook the harmless as fish and enmesh them in the net. The haughty, austere and cruel ones of “Christendom” treat those who serve God as though they were creeping things. Thus they oppose God and defame his name. God will vindicate his name before the enemy and uphold his servant class, and thus he will let the wicked know that Jehovah “ruleth in Jacob [his anointed people] unto the ends of the earth”.—Ps. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">59: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3T</sup> Those who truly serve God now are objects of ill-treatment at the hands of the rulers of “Christendom”. “They take up all of them with the angle, they cateh them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.” (Hab. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1:15) </span><span class="font4">In the past the enemy has employed hook methods to ill-treat individuals, but now they pursue </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">wholesale dragnet method by forming and executing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">wholesale conspiracy against the Lord’s hidden ones. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">striking example of this in the present day is found in Germany, where its leader declares his purpose to have a state religion and is persecuting all who truly serve Jehovah God. These wicked earthly rulers take special delight in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses. The wicked dictator regime worships its own wicked system. By fraud, coercion and seductive propaganda these wicked ones create an ‘emergency’ as an excuse to take away the rights of the common people, and they exercise a cruel and dictatorial power over all. “Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.” (Hab. 1: 16) By assuming and exercising their power the wicked for a time prosper even against those devoted to Jehovah; but let none of the anointed be discouraged. How would it be possible now to maintain one’s integrity toward God if one did not suffer persecution at the hands of the unrighteous ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Habakkuk then, anxious to see righteousness triumph, propounds the question, which question now is in the mouth of the remnant class. The dupes of Satan under Gog’s leadership continue to oppress the righteous; and hence the question is propounded: “Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?” The dictators of the nations have given heed to the conspiracy of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and other religious leaders, because they wanted to believe that they, the leaders, had the privilege of punishing those who declare the righteousness of Jehovah and his kingdom. The truth of God’s Word now being declared by Jehovah’s witnesses is spoiling the pastures of the wicked religionists, and the sounding of this message is very annoying to the clergy. A conspiracy for the destruction of God’s hidden ones is formed, and Satan and his coconspirators proceed to carry out the wicked agreement by continuously committing overt acts against God’s people. Up to this point in the prophecy Habakkuk has propounded some pertinent questions, and seeks the answer from the Lord. Likewise today, in view of the fact that Christ is upon his throne and is at the temple of God, and Jehovah’s name must be vindicated; and in view of the further faet that Jehovah’s witnesses continue to be subjected to cruel persecution at the hands of the wicked ones, the remnant now propound some pertinent and important questions. For the answer to these questions we must now look to the prophecy of Habakkuk that follows, wherein the prophet pictures himself as a watchman waiting for God’s answer.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GOD’S MESSENGER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LIHU, </span><span class="font4">the young man who waited until three older men had completed their foolish speeches to the suffering Job, spoke to the afflicted one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">sound questions and advice uttered by Elihu were not, as he said, the result of his personal knowledge or wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every creature that is pleasing to the Lord God must welcome the knowledge that comes to him of the distinction between God and Satan, and take his stand unequivocally on the side of Jehovah. Elihu put himself on the side of Jehovah and unequivocally stood for Jehovah God. This is important also to keep in mind as a rule that should be followed by all who are pleasing to the Lord. The great sage of Israel, Paul, in his day saw the danger of receiving flattery and giving flattery to men. He said: “Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” —1 Cor. 3:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Addressing Job, Elihu said: “Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy; he putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.”—Job 33: 8-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Job had spoken without understanding. He could understand that his suffering was not because of his willful sin against God. His professed friends had not taught him in the right way, even as the clergy have</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>AND INTERPRETER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">not taught the people in the right way concerning God and why men suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Elihu proceeded with his speech in praise of Jehovah God. The words of Elihu were prophetic and told of the Lord’s purpose to stay the destructiveness of sickness and death, and to redeem or ransom man; and that those who will then be obedient to God, after receiving knowledge, shall return to the days of their youth. His were words of life, showing God’s purpose to give life to man by means of redemption, resurrection and the kingdom blessings. He first shows the human race, pictured by a man sick, afflicted, emaciated and almost dead. He shows man abhorring everything about him, even his bread and meat, because of his great suffering, and then points out that if there be with man a messenger to interpret and make plain the right way, God is gracious to man and delivers him from going down to the grave; and he assigns as the reason therefor the great ransom provision. His words are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth: he shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him; and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. He looketh upon men; and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.”—Job 33:18-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the picture, whom did Elihu represent? Job had expressed his desire that he might be taught in the right way and to understand wherein he had erred. (Job 6: 24) When Elihu began his speech, he made no claim that he was speaking his own words of wisdom, but stated that he spoke as the mouthpiece of Jehovah God and that he would ascribe all honor and glory to God. He said to Job: “Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead; I also am formed out of the clay. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.” (Job 33:6,7) Then Elihu added: “I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. ’ ’—Job 36: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection call to mind that when Jesus was on earth he said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.” “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” “But he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. ... As my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. . . . For I do always those things that please him.” (John 7:16; 6:63; 8:26, 28,29) Jesus Christ was God’s Anointed One, which means that he was commissioned by Jehovah to speak in behalf of Jehovah God. (Isa. 61:1-3) All those who have been brought into the body of Christ and anointed with the holy spirit of God are authorized or commissioned in the name of the Lord to speak his message concerning reconciliation of man to God. (2 Cor. 5: 20) The conclusion is therefore irresistible that Elihu in the picture represented God’s anointed witnesses. Elihu therefore pictured Christ Jesus the Head and also the members of his body. All these constitute God’s Servant, as it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles [nations]. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles [nations] ; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. I am the Lord; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.”— Isa. 42:1, 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, Elihu was a young man, and therefore pictured the “young men” upon whom the Lord has poured out his spirit in these latter days since coming to his temple. Such are the ones who become God’s witnesses. (Joel 2:28) These are the “young men” who have taken their stand wholly on the side of the Lord God and against the Devil and his organization. The Lord’s inspired witness, writing of and concerning such class, said: “I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. . . . Because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. Love not the world.” (1 John 2:13-15) These are the ones who are described by the prophet as ‘ ‘ the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace ’ ’, and who tell of God’s great purpose of salvation and say to the people of the Lord: ‘ ‘ Thy God reigneth! ’ ’ They are the ones that constitute the “watchmen” who joyfully join together in a harmonious testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God.-Isa. 52: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Elihu said to Job: “If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand [God's anointed servant], to shew unto man his uprightness [to show man the right way].” Elihu therefore shows by his language that he pictured the “interpreter”, the “messenger” of God, the servant of the Lord God, who is God’s anointed and who is commissioned to speak the Word of God for the comfort of those of mankind who desire to know the truth. It is God’s anointed class that is commanded to “ prepare . . . the way of the people; . . . cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people”. (Isa. 62:10) This prophecy applies specifically after the Lord takes his power and begins his reign, and after he comes to his temple and assembles Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Elihu therefore pictured the class to whom the Lord God said: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.”—Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We may know that we have the proper understanding of a prophecy when we are able to apply to the words of the prophecy the physical facts which clearly appear and then find that they fit exactly. Seeing that the words of the Lord show that in the picture Elihu must have represented his anointed servant cla^s, what are the facts showing the fulfillment thereof? The indisputable facts show that there is now on earth, and has been within the last few years, a company of men and women who are wholly devoted to God and his government of righteousness. These constitute his anointed servant. The Lord came to his temple in 1918 (A.D.). It was in 1922, or thereabout, when his people began to see and appreciate the distinction between God’s organization and Satan’s organization. Particularly since 1922 the ones faithfully devoted to the Lord have been going forth with gladness in their hearts, explaining or interpreting the Word of God and telling the people who will hear of and concerning God, his mighty power, and his gracious provision to grant eternal life to man; and pointing out to them that God has placed upon his throne his anointed King Christ Jesus, and that during his reign all the peoples and nations of the earth shall have an opportunity to receive everlasting life and live upon earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE REAL PROPITIATION FOR SINS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font4">NCE each year, on the tenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish calendar, the law of Jehovah God required the Jewish nation to hold </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">day of atonement for sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the Christian era, which was foreshadowed by Israel’s atonement day, men and women have consecrated themselves to do God’s will. This they have done because of faith in God and faith in the blood of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, as their redemptive price. Their consecration having been accepted by Jehovah, such have been brought into the condition of peace with God, which is the condition of justification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The justification of such ones resulted in the right </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to live as a </span><span class="font4">human creature, which life Jehovah then </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">there accepts as a sacrifice through Christ Jesus that the consecrated one may be brought into the cove</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nant </span><span class="font4">with God by sacrifice. (Ps. 50:5) Thereupon Jehovah, the heavenly Father, begets such by his spirit as his child and acknowledges him as a son of God with the conditional right to life in heaven as a spirit creature. In due time God sets before him the call or invitation to enter the covenant for the kingdom with Christ Jesus. If he responds to the heavenly call and meets the requirements laid down in the sacred Word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God, then the Lord chooses or elects him and anoints him with his holy spirit as a witness for Jehovah and a joint-heir with Jesus Christ. Thus he becomes an anointed one and a member of the body of Christ of which Jesus is the Head. He is then offered up by Jesus Christ the High Priest as a part </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">His own sacrifice. All true Christians who have taken these steps and who have been dealt with thus by the Lord God are pictured in the Lord’s goat which was sacrificed by the ancient Jewish high priest on the day of atonement and the blood of which was taken into the most holy and applied to the mercy seat. When the sacrifice of the members of the body </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Christ is complete Christ Jesus the great High Priest again presents the value of his sacrifice in heaven itself, as a sin-offering on behalf of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">sacrifice of the Lord’s goat was preceded by the sacrifice of an unblemished bullock, its blood being sprinkled on the mercy seat in the most holy. The first Jewish high priest ordained by Jehovah God was Aaron the brother of Moses, and Aaron’s sons were ordained to be underpriests. The offering of the blood of the bullock was for Aaron and his house. (Lev. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">16:11) </span><span class="font4">In the reality during the Christian era the offering of the blood of Christ Jesus, when he ascended on high, was presented in behalf of those who are begotten by the spirit of God as his sons and who are in the covenant by sacrifice. The offering of the blood of the Lord’s goat was for the people or nation of Israel, the Jews. (Lev. 16:15) Likewise, at the end of the present period of sacrifice foreshadowed by the Jewish atonement day, the blood of Christ will be presented as an offering on behalf of all the people of earth. It is therefore seen that on the atonement day the ransom sacrifice of Jesus was pictured in the court of the tabernacle, and the sin-offering in the “holiest of all” of the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tabernacle was a part of the law covenant arrangement which Jehovah inaugurated at Mount Sinai in Arabia, with Moses acting as mediator in behalf of the Jewish nation, the Israelites. Referring to this the apostle Paul wrote, saying: “Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly [or divinely arranged] sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made; the first [compartment], wherein was the candlestick; and the table, and the shewbread [thereon] ; which is called the sanctuary [or holy]. And after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat: of which we cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.”—Heb. 9:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statement here is that the priest “always”, that is to say, daily, went into the holy to accomplish the service of God. That service consisted of the morning and evening sacrifice, and had nothing to do with the yearly atonement-day sacrifice.—Num. 28:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The holiest of all, or second compartment of the tabernacle, was the place for sprinkling the blood of the animals on the day of atonement. It foreshadowed the great sacrifice of our Lord being presented in heaven itself. Christ Jesus when on earth laid down his life as a perfect sacrifice. Then he ascended on high, and there in heaven itself made a presentation of his sacrifice as an offering for sin, as it is written further by the apostle Paul (Heb. 9:7-11):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But into the second [compartment] went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: the holy [spirit; of God] this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all [namely, heaven itself] was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: which was a [prophetic] figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which [service] stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,” did bring about redemption for the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the apostle says that the blood of the animals offered on the atonement day foreshadowed the offering of the blood of Christ as redemption for man. He says: “Neither by the blood of goats and calves [or bullocks], but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemp-tiop for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sancti-fieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? ’ ’ —Heb. 9:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blood of the animals at Mount Sinai foreshad</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">owed </span><span class="font4">the ransom and sin-offering, and was the basis for the confirmation of the law covenant of God with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Israelites. The blood of Christ Jesus provided the redemptive price and an offering for sin on behalf of mankind, and is the basis for the making and inauguration of the new covenant which the Lord God promised in the prophecies. (Heb. 9:15-21) Then the apostle makes it clear and positive that the blood of Christ Jesus is essential to salvation, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And almost all things are by the law purged with blood [of animals] ; and without shedding of blood </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is no </span><span class="font4">remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these [sacrifices]; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures [pictorial] of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the [Jewish] high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then must he [Jesus] often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. ’ ’—Heb. 9: 22-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing Scriptural argument proves beyond any question of doubt that the blood of Jesus is the great redemptive price for mankind, and that the presentation of that blood in heaven constitutes the sin-offering on behalf of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many will then naturally ask, Why, in the face of this tremendous argument showing the value of the shed blood of Christ Jesus, are there so many men claiming to be preachers of the gospel who deny that the blood of the Lord Jesus has any purchasing value whatsoever? The answer to that question the Lord foretold and caused his inspired witness to write down, saying, “But there were false prophets also among the [Jewish] people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.” (2 Pet. 2:1) “For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ; ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Jude 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Will the people continue to be hoodwinked by these false prophets, who are wise in their own conceits and who pose as preachers of the gospel, or will they be guided by the plain Word of God, which is now due to be understood? Let each hearer answer for himself.</span></p>

For this reason </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> published facts concerning a system of reckoning time, obtaining the important data from the Scriptures, and some from astronomy. Seeing there is a danger of giving importance to this and to the exclusion of weightier matters, this note of warning is here sounded. God’s people should keep in mind the “pyramid” delusion and the speculations that accompanied the study of chronology, and the pitfalls into which these things led many. Do not fall into a similar trap. It is of far more importance to understand our commission and to perform it than to understand at just what time Adam was created. Be reasonable and moderate. Avoid wild speculation as to at what time and in what manner things future will come to pass. Be sure that you always are guided by the counsel of the Lord’s Word. The statements in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> are not dogmatie, but are worthy of due and careful consideration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S LEADING AND HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I know I should not take up your time, yet I cannot restrain the impulse to write you after reading the article on “Questions” in March 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My heart goes up in thanks to Jehovah that I find myself 100 percent in harmony, therefore obedient to the purposes of His organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am from among the lowest of fallen flesh, uneducated, uncouth, cowardly and rough, and I must admit I do not take a brilliant polish now. I was a drunkard from my mother’s womb, marked that way, and have drunk anything from Jamaica ginger to lubbmg alcohol when these periods came on me. I smoked cigarettes nearly thirty years. With the Devil’s help I have dabbled with these at times since I have been in pioneer service; but I thank God for His leadings and help (2 Pet. 2: 9), for every word of that article was injected into my mind, in my fight to cast off these filthy habits. Thank Jehovah, I quit them long before this article was printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One other point that helped me to lay aside cigarettes was (and it is a fact known to all who indulge) that anyone engaged in the Lord’s service who continues tobacco must sooner or later become a hypocrite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am not smart or wise, but I am absolutely sure that the Watch Tower and its publications constitute the Lord’s table, and anyone eating at that table and assimilating the food thereon must learn that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the all-important issue, and that no creature is needed to vindicate that name, but that through “The Birth of The Nation” Jehovah purposed through His Son to give 144,000 imperfect creatuies the privilege of having a part in that great drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I thank God that when the smart elders were advising the companies to put the March 1 1925 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">watchtower</span><span class="font3"> on the shelf to gather cobwebs I was wearing out several copies, tiying to get this great truth into my little dcgiaded mind, and by the grace of God my labors vveie rewaidcd; and I have a copy of that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> before me now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Oh, how I wish that, article “Questions” had been printed years ago! It would have saved me many heaitachcs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford, all the trouble I have ever had with any creature at the temple has been caused because I stand firmly, boldly and uncompromisingly for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and I just cannot remain quiet and listen to some individual, putted up, trying to appear very wise and putting to the foie his own wisdom, in many cases even to the point of plain ridicule of the contents of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> when the very purpose of their being there is to aid (I won’t say their brethren, tor I very much doubt this class) those assembled to a better understanding of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Begging your pardon for encioacliing on your time, and praying to Jehovah daily that your sticngch and zeal may continue to the end, I hope by the grace of God and in his strength to continue to the end with you, shouting “For Jehovah and for Gideon ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With warmest love,</span></p>

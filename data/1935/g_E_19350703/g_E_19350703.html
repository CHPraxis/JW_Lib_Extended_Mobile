<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XVI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Government and Misgovernment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(A full report of the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Washington will appear in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> No. 413.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Uncle Sam took over the government of Puerto Rico, 37 years ago, the island was in great need of a wise and noble administration. The results may now be appraised. Here are two bulletins put out by the Government itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first mentions that Uncle Sam has so ruled on the mainland as to enable one man to have an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">income</span><span class="font7"> of over $5,000,000 a year; one has over $4,000,000; one has over $3,000,000 ; 8 have over $2,000,000 ; 6 have over $1,500,000; 29 have over $1,000,000 ; 28 have over $750,000; 56 have over $500,000; 55 have over $400,000; 84 have over $300,000; 101 have over $250,000; 187 have over $200,000; 405 have over $150,000; 1,085 have over $100,000 ; 5,927 have over $50,000; 18,168 have over $25,000, and 28,189 have incomes of over $15,000 a year. But perhaps these </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">incomes</span><span class="font7"> on the mainland may not, after all, be the best index as to what Uncle Sam has been able to do for the downtrodden workers of Puerto Rico. So here is what the greatest and wisest and best government on earth has been able to do in 37 years, according to the Women’s Bureau of the Department of Labor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Approximately half of the 123 women who were sewing on handkerchiefs were making about 1 cent an hour; 30 percent were earning about 2 cents an hour, and a very few were earning as much as 6 cents. For the group of 323 home workers as a whole, that is, not only those working on handkerchiefs but those on household linens, dresses, cotton nightgowns, silk lingerie, men’s pants and shirts, the earnings are somewhat lower than those of the handkerchief workers. Reduced to an hourly basis, almost one-third of the 323 were earning less than 1 cent an hour, about one-half were earning 1 or 2 cents, and comparatively few—slightly more than one-twentieth—were earning from 4 to 8 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The scale of hourly earnings ran somewhat higher in men’s pants and shirts than in other lines, and was lowest in cotton nightgowns and household linens. None of the 94 home workers in gowns and linens earned as much as 3 cents an hour, and almost three-fourths were earning less than a cent an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In silk lingerie most of the women were earning 1 to 2 or 3 cents an hour ■ in dresses and handkerchiefs few were earning as much as 3 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one little shop, inside workers were embroidering on handkerchiefs the same designs as done by home workers. A very good inside worker was finishing eight pieces a day, paid at the rate of 45 cents a dozen. Speeding all day, almost without interruption, that worker was able to make 30 cents a day, or between 3 and 4 cents an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A fairly simple design of cotton nightgowns for which contractor pays agent 43 cents a dozen and agent pays homer worker 30 cents; the agent’s sister, a particularly fast and good sewer, can finish six gowns a day, working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.; that is 15 cents for at least 10 hours of work, or about 1J cents an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A very ornate embroidery design and scallop trimming around neck and armholes. Design consists of 1| yards of double hemstitching and 120 each of eyelets and embroidered leaves, dots, and stems. The contractor pays $1.43 a dozen gowns for this work, and agent pays home worker $1.25. The agent estimated that a swift worker might do all the embroidery but hemstitching on one gown in a day, working morning, afternoon, and night. She would earn not over 10 cents for such a day’s work, probably averaging about 1 cent an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hand scalloping and ornate embroidery on cotton pillowcases for which the rate is $1 per dozen pieces. A manager stated, “A girl must be very rapid to make two, working steadily all day. ” If a girl could make two a day (and no girl doing this type of work reported such an accomplishment) she would earn 16 or 17 cents, less than 2 cents an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Starvation is rife in Puerto Rico. 'My country, ’tis of thee—land of the noble free—of thee I sing.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lying About Uncle Sam</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font7">IS not true that Uncle Sam, in the first eight J- months of the current fiscal year, expended $2,500,000,000 more than he took in. Actually it was only $2,249,923,235.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Gathering at the Festal Board</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font7"> says, “In the past two years there has been an increase of 105,000 in the number of Government employees in the city of Washington alone/'’ In other words, if you have noticed a great change for the better, this is the reason, and if you have noticed a great change for the worse, this is also it. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font7"> goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can be but one result if these activities on the part of the Government continue. It will mean “one big state” ruled from Washington. And “one big state” governed by one administration, regimenting all classes of industries and agriculture—and to a degree, also labor—all this is exactly what now exists in Italy under the Fascist government and in Germany under Hitler. If that is the kind of government the Administration wants us to have, we are very close to it, and unless we try to stop it—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and now—</span><span class="font6">we are likely to be in it before we know it, since few of us pay much attention to the laws that are being passed except for those which happen to interest us personally. But already the Administration has enacted measures which put us so close to the borderline of fascism that it would not require much more to render American independence and freedom a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government Running on Hot Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font7">EMANDING the immediate repeal of both the NRA and the AAA, Senator Tydings, Democrat, of Maryland, astonished the United States Senate and the world at large when he said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We can’t go on running a government on hot air. &quot;We can’t go on just trying to pull money out of the heavens. The whole philosophy of this administration has been to increase and not to decrease unemployment. Unless we about-face and walk back toward sanity, we’ll rue the day we have reached. We have pursued the mad policies that have brought Europe to the brink of war. Eventually we will just be taxed to death under the present program. We have come to treat a billion dollars as if it were a hundred thousand. We are pursuing a policy that as long as we can borrow we can provide. Let us be men and have courage to abandon all of this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Throwing Things at the NR A</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">ODAY the NRA has no friends, except those politicians who depend upon it for a livelihood. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font7"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The NRA ought to be killed, and the anti-trust laws ought to be revived. The president would merely be living up to his promises if he killed the NRA. It has been definitely damaging to business, definitely obstructive to recovery. It is an utter failure.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>“War Is a Racket”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N HIS informative book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">War Is a Racket, </span><span class="font7">published by the Round Table Press, Inc., of New York, General Smedley D. Butler asks the pertinent question,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Who provides the profits—these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 percent? We all pay them—in taxation. We paid the bankers their profits when we bought Liberty Bonds at $100 and sold them back at $84 or $86 to the bankers. These bankers collected $100 plus. It was a simple manipulation. The bankers control the security marts. It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds. Then all of us, the people, got frightened and sold the bonds at $84 or $86. The bankers bought them. Then these same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par and above. Then the bankers collected their profits. And the soldiers bought about $2,000,000,000 worth of these bonds. In the government hospital at Marion, Ind., 1,000 of these boys are in pens! Five hundred of them are in a barracks with steel bars and wires all around outside the buildings and on the porches. These already have been mentally destroyed. These boys don’t even look like human [creatures]. Most soldiers got no money at all on paydays.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Navy Conspiring Against the Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is a happy land not far away where trusted officials of the Navy conspired with the New York, Bethlehem and Newport News shipbuilding companies to award $30,000,000 of ships away from government yards to these private yards. From 1927 to 1934 the ‘big three’ above named discussed their prices before they submitted bids to the Navy department, agreed which ships each company wanted, and arranged their bids so that each company would get the right ships at the right price, which price was 100 percent advance over previous prices charged the Navy. The Navy men who engineered this deal will never have to work any more; that much is certain.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Grafting in War Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font7">RAFTING in the War Department enabled one contractor to clean up $7,000,000 over and above his legitimate claim. An officer received $2,500 as a ‘loan’ from a lobbyist, which has never been repaid. Government business is carried on in hotel rooms and in private homes; army officers receive the most lavish entertainment at the hands of lobbyists. The Department of Justice may take a hand. It’s a great world.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>At the Shrine of the Golden Calf</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE decision as to whether the United States shall worship a solid gold calf or a filled-gold calf has been duly made, and it is decided by 5 to 4 that a filled calf is as good to worship as a solid one. It created plenty of excitement. Santa Fe stock went up $10 a share, and cotton $1 a bale. In an hour 1,000,000 shares changed hands. The general sympathy of the public was with the filled-gold calf idea, but the solid-golders took their sorrows seriously. Justice McReynolds, speaking for the minority, said: “We are confronted with a condition in which the dollar may be reduced to 50 cents today, 30 cents tomorrow, 10 cents the next day, and 1 cent the day after. The Constitution, as we have known it, is gone. This is Nero at his worst.” “The impending legal and moral chaos is appalling.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Front Trench for Munition Makers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">epresentative O’Malley, Wisconsin Democrat, has introduced a bill to force those who profit most by war to serve in the ranks and answer the military roll call before anyone else may be called. O’Malley would like to see Henry Ford, Andrew Mellon, J. P. Morgan, the Rockefellers and the du Ponts all in the uniform of buck privates, and thinks it might be quite amusing to the du Ponts to be shot with munitions of their own manufacture sold by them to the enemy countries they are now arming.

<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Butler Names the Big Shots</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">eneral Smedley D. Butler claims, in effect, that the American Legion is controlled by the bankers, and lists as persons that should be questioned about the plot to seize the government of the United States: Grayson M. P. Murphy, Wall Street broker; Louis McHenry Howe, secretary to President Roosevelt; Governor Ely, of Massachusetts; General Douglas MacArthur, chief of staff of the United States Army; Alfred E. Smith, and the Legion Commanders Hanford McNider, Frank N. Belgrano and William Doyle. The name of President Roosevelt was also involved.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Patriots of International Murderers, Limited</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">NTERNATIONAL MURDERERS, Limited, would not help Germany to rearm. Of course not. But they sold 'mail planes’ to Germany exactly like the fighting planes they sold to the United States Navy. They also sold Germany, for industrial purposes, powder, bullets and machine guns. And the joke of it is that these selfconfessed patriots, that paid munitions dividends of 39,000 percent and 1,143,275 percent, let the foreigners have lower prices than they charged to Uncle Sam. These are the men that bust up peace conferences, by men used to such work, that are hired for the purpose, like William B. Shearer. In case of war these are the men that supply the United States with advice and really run the country.

<p><span class="font6">All signs point unmistakably to the fact that we are being pushed gradually, surely, closer and eloser to the precipice of war. The patrioteers and publicists, the munition makers and the profit takers, the coupon clippers and the wage slicers, the Hearst scaremongers and the jingo journalists, the subversive propagandists for war in high places, all are whooping it up for another war. The excuse doesn’t matter. Excuses can easily be found, as they have been found before. President Roosevelt, urging a starvation wage on public works, skyrockets the military budget to its highest peacetime peak. The government, impotent to set its house in order and provide subsistence and comfort to the army of the unemployed, strengthens its military bases; stages naval maneuvers in the Pacific, builds more and better warships; proposes to militarize the CCC, and enlarges our standing army.</span></p>

Therefore the Dick-stein committee has proved itself an accomplice to the Fascist plot to undermine the government of the United States. . . .

The committee heard Butler’s testimony behind closed doors; then it released garbled statements of what Butler had said to the press, later issuing parts of his testimony. But the important parts of Butler’s testimony have been suppressed, and no reason has been given for the suppression. Why? Because Wall Street interests such as J. P. Morgan arc involved.”</span></p>

The whole class laughed. I was so afraid, I wanted to cry. And then I used often to be late so that I shouldn *t have to shout 'Heil, Hitler!’ The master used to give me extra work to do as a punishment. He wrote in the class book, ‘For Jewish slovenliness.’</span></p>

The worst thing of all was in the breaks’ in the courtyard. We children of Jewish and Marxists parents had to go into a comer of the courtyard by ourselves. Then there was always trouble.

<p><span class="font6">“Here is one characteristic incident, related to me recently by a young writer of great talent from the West. He became alarmed at the reports of what was happening in Germany, because his mother was still living there, and took a trip to the little town in which she lived. Whilst there, one of her neighbors, who was a widow with two sons, both of whom had served in the German armj<sup>r</sup> in the World War, came to his mother’s home in great agony and explained that a few days previously Nazi soldiers had come to her home and had forcibly taken her sons away, without reason or explanation. She suspected, from their arrogant and insulting conduct, that their visit boded no good, and so, having heard nothing from them after a few days, she began to make inquiries, the result of which was that two sealed coffins, said to contain the bodies of her sons, were delivered at her place with instructions that under no circumstances were they to be opened. A courageous man in that community dared, however, to open the coffins, and was confronted by the gruesome sight of the bodies of the two young men, having been so mangled and emasculated that there was not an unbroken bone left in either body, from the top of their heads to their feet. There was, of course, no remedy. There is never any remedy in Germany for any atrocity committed by German soldiers. The word ‘Sadists’ was invented for such people. They are human [creatures] turned into wild beasts.”</span></p>

In three months last winter, in Germany, 700,000 were added to the army of the workless. German army officers are buying fine horses all over Denmark, Norway and Sweden. A decree has been issued that farms may be condemned anywhere, for garrisons and drill and target practice grounds. Physical training is required of all males.</span></p>

At Merthyr Tydvil they broke through a police cordon, smashed the windows and overturned the furniture in the office of the Unemployment Assistance Board when 1,000 women marched to the office to complain of cuts in their allowances. In Sheffield 30,000 engaged in a fierce fight with the police in which 30 were hurt. Women used umbrellas as weapons. Concerning the Means Test, which was the basis for these complaints, George Lansbury, Labor statesman, said: “The Labor party protested and pleaded in vain against the dreadful regulations and we were defeated every time. With the banks full of idle money, with our streets filled with despairing men and women, and with an increasing daily toll of robberies and suicides, brought on by despair, the Government tells us nothing can be done.” So many thousands of protests went up from all over Great Britain that the government was forced to abandon the cuts in relief compensation.

If your class goes to war you will appeal to the workingmen to help you, and I hope when that day dawns the workers will use their rifles on the ruling classes.” Pretty savage talk for the house of Parliament, is it not?</span></p>

The money to pay for all this is money owing to Uncle Sam, which will never be paid. The money was loaned with the understanding that thereby the world would be made safe for democracy. Concerning this propaganda former premier Baldwin said in the House of Commons: “The greatest mistake made after the World War was the spreading of the belief that the world was safe for democracy. The world never has been unsafer for democracy than it is today.” Even if they are a little late with their admissions, it is nice to have all the great statesmen admit that no greater liars have ever lived than those that were responsible for the murder of 50,000,000 human creatures in 1914-1918.</span></p>

Moreover, we did the job free of charge, and even paid most of the bills. . . . The idea behind it was to line up the “enlightened opinion of the world” against the French appetite for power and glory. This enlightened opinion, of course, was to be supplied by England, with the United States standing by as stooge, bouncer and paymaster. But as Wilson passed out of the picture the United States began to sec a red light, and in the end flatly refused to join. . . .

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Fathers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘— — . — - — - . ■ - - —</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HY are the Roman Catholic priests called “fathers” and the pope called “holy father”? Is such according to the authority of the Bible? You prefer to have the answer of Jesus to this question, because He speaks the truth. At Matthew 23:9, Jesus said: 'Call no man father upon the earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven.’ Jesus did not permit anyone to call Him “father”, nor did any of His apostles take that title. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Father</span><span class="font7"> means life-giver, and only God can and does give life; hence the title applies to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no Scriptural authority whatsoever to call a Catholic priest “father”, and certainly there is no Scriptural authority to call the pope the “holy father”. The title could not apply to any of them as earthly parents, because none of them marry. When Jesus was on earth the clergy of that day were claiming to be servants of God and they loved to be called “Rabbi” and “Master” and to be exalted amongst men. Their conduct in this regard Jesus declared was an abomination in the sight of God. (Luke 16:15) It still must be an abomination in God’s sight for men to assume titles that belong to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why has the Roman Catholic hierarchy taught the people to call men by the name “father”? The answer is that the great enemy of Jehovah God is the Devil. He is also man’s worst enemy. For centuries the Devil has been trying to turn all men away from God, and he employs fraud and deceit to accomplish that wrongful purpose. It is stated, in 2 Corinthians 4, that the Devil blinds men to the truth lest they should know and serve God. About the fourth century Satan blinded the leaders in the Roman Catholic church organization and caused them to exalt themselves and call themselves “fathers” and the head of the organization “papa” or “pope”. The people, being blinded to the truth, follow that custom and have given honor and praise to men, and thus the Devil has caused them to lose sight of their duty toward God, and has turned them away from God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does the exaltation of men by giving them high-sounding titles, honor and praise, work injury to the people? Yes, a very great injury;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">~by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font7"> the reason that it causes them to lose sight of God, from whom all their blessings must proceed. Thus they become the dupes of Satan. The time has come for the people now to learn the truth of God’s W’ord, that they may take their stand wholly on the side of God and live. The book called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> tells of man’s proper relationship to God, the Creator, and this, together with your Bible, will enable you to learn these great truths. The Roman Catholic hierarchy is not God’s creation, but is an organization formed by men; and such organization Satan has overreached and used to turn millions of people away from God and His kingdom. The Catholic hierarchy at all times has discouraged the people from reading the Bible, telling them that only the clergy can understand the Bible. That is another scheme of Satan to keep the people in the dark, because he is the prince of darkness and the enemy of God and attempts to turn all persons away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the will of God that men should learn the truth which is set forth in the Scriptures. Men who compose the Catholic hierarchy, and hence called “clergymen”, have used that religious organization to enrich themselves by inducing the people to give them money to practice their religion. That is bad enough, but they have done the people even a greater injury by preventing them from learning the truth of God’s Word. Soon God will greatly debase those men who have exalted themselves. Only the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus shall be exalted. The name and glory of men shall perish and the name of Jehovah shall endure for ever. Don’t be misled by giving honor and praise to men; but, as the Scriptures declare, give Jehovah God the glory that is due His holy name, and thus put yourself in line for the blessings that He has in store for those that love and serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great commandment God gave to man is, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul and mind.’ To obey that commandment man must devote himself to God and honor God. Did not He command the Israelites, 'Honor thy father and mother’? Yes, but the word “fa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ther” in that scripture means Jehovah God, who is the great Life-giver, and the word “mother” means God’s organization through which He gives life to His creatures. In harmony with this it is written, in Isaiah 54, that those who are given life are born of God’s woman, that is, His organization. Jehovah is the great Teacher, and He teaches all who become His sons. It is therefore an insult to God to address a clergyman by the title “father”, because that is bestowing upon imperfect man the title of honor that belongs to Jehovah God.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>Paper Removal of Intolerance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE widespread paper removal of intolerance continues, with plans to put it across in 500 American cities. Headlines give the paregoric passed out in the public press as follows: “Good Will Trio Gets Biggest Reception in Jacksonville ; Tour Country to Bring About Better Understanding Between Religions and to Promote Peaceful Pursuits in Turbulent Times.” (This was in Jacksonville, Fla., where the backers were the Chamber of Commerce and kindred organizations.) “Blow at Religious Intolerance; Aim of Second Brotherhood Day; All Faiths Unite in Battle Against Prejudices; Programme Planned in 500 or More Communities; Aim to End Discord; Work Against Hatreds; Prejudices Put Aside; Roosevelt Gives Support.” “Creeds Unite for Program Here Sunday; City Churches Join in National Observance of GoodWill Day Sunday.” “Forum Hears Pastors Plead for Toleration.” “Clergymen of Three Creeds Break Bread; Religious History Written when Protestant, Catholic and Jewish Leaders Talk Over Tolerance Issue; Laymen Speak.” “Rabbi, Minister and Priest Bring Plea of Co-operation to Fourth Good Will Meet; Protestant Cites Economic Justice, World Peace and Crime as Problems on Which All Creeds Can Join in Solving.” “Leaders of Three Churches Speak Here for Religious Understanding.” (This was at Nashville, and the Catholic speaker, Reverend Peter M. H. Wynhoven, of Louisiana, is the same that compelled a radio station in his own state'to discontinue broadcasting the addresses of Judge Rutherford.) And so it goes on down the line, a humbug from beginning to end, intended to keep the people from learning the truth about the Devil’s organization and about God’s kingdom as the one and only hope of the world. These clergymen are ready to tear one another limb from limb, but, badly as they hate and fear one another, they hate and fear Judge Rutherford and Jehovah’s witnesses in general much more, and are willing to do anything in reason or out of reason to put an end to the proclamation of the truth and to the proclaimers themselves.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>Anthony Kubitsky of West Hazelton</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">TJurgf.ss Anthony Kubitsky, of West Hazleton, Pa., religious affiliations not known, but guessed, has issued a statement to the effect that any persons desiring to distribute religious literature, for any purpose whatsoever, will hereafter “have to secure the recommendation and identification of West Hazleton clergymen of their own faith, either Protestant, or Catholic, before they will be allowed to start”. That is rich. What Mr. Kubitsky, perhaps recently from Poland, wishes to say is that if Jesus Christ and the twelve apostles came to West Hazleton, Pa., in view of the fact that none of them were members of any of the sects now in West Hazleton, they could not do a thing about publishing the truth in that burg, not a thing, because the West Hazleton clergymen, Protestant and Catholic, having no acquaintance with either Christ or His apostles, would withhold the necessary passport. It is to laugh—at Mr. Kubitsky. He still thinks, no doubt, that he is in Poland.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Laughing at the Chattanooga News</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HEN some editors start to write one wonders how their parents ever contrived to get them into ordinary clothing when it is so manifest that their level is that of the fourfooted equine with the long ears and the reverberating bray of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Equus asinits.</span><span class="font7"> Thus the editor of the Chattanooga </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> writes a column and a half on the subject “The End of the World” and begins it with this statement: “We happened to listen to one Judge Rutherford, who peddles religious books over the radio and who specializes in throwing the fear of eternal damnation in the minds of the superstitious. Judge Rutherford predicts the world will come to an end before very long.” Probably every one of the readers of the Chattanooga </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> knows perfectly well that Judge Rutherford says not one word over the radio or in his books about the damnation that occupies the mind of the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font7"> and which damnation is there only because said editor is so terribly superstitious and uninformed. Judge Rutherford makes no effort to reach those steeped in bigotry and superstition, as the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Neivs</span><span class="font7"> manifestly is steeped, but seeks the intelligent who are willing to use their brains, and who can see, as any sensible man can see, and as the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> cannot see, that the doctrine of eternal torture, which he no doubt professes to believe, has not a leg to stand upon and is worthy only of the contempt it now generally receives from the intelligent. On February 24, 1918, Judge Rutherford gave his famous lecture, “The World </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Has</span><span class="font7"> Ended; Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” The editor of the Chattanooga </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> is either an old man who has lost his grip or a young one who never had it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>“Three Faiths in Brotherhood”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">rpiIE headlines in the papers carefully con-ceal the outrages to Jehovah’s witnesses in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New Jersey and in various other places, including Germany. They make no mention of repeated arrests and imprisonment for no offense except obedience to the Scriptures, which command the preaching of the gospel from house to house. But the papers have much to say of the three faiths that are now in brotherhood, i.e., Protestant, Catholic and Jewish, and tell about the religious liberty, human freedom, deep abiding faith in men and faith in God, alleged to characterize them. This faith, it may be said, has the ears of the Democratic jackass, the nose of the Republican elephant, the eyes of the owl, the teeth of the lion, the flippers of the whale, the wings of the ostrich, the belly of the great fish that swallowed Jonah, and the tail of the Berkshire pig. All four of its feet are different; none of its knees are alike; the legs all point in different directions. None can tell whether it is walking, crawling, swimming or flying. Its voice is a cross between the plaintive moo of the brindle cow, the roar of the lion and the bray of the mule, and it has the heaves. Part of it is covered with hide, part is covered with feathers, and part is covered with scales. Its appetite is enormous. It will swallow anything. Its breath is enough to give anybody the blind staggers. Its eyes are crossed, and, for fear that they would be of any use, they are hidden under the ears. The creature is spavined, sickly, and lousy. Useless now, it will die soon and the odor will drive humanity into the next county. Its horns have been broken off, and in their place is the triple crown so familiar to all cartoonists. It would fain rule all humanity, but cannot get away with it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N A circular letter Reverend George W. Ker-lin, pastor of the Toulminville (Ala.) Methodist Episcopal church, South, says: “The hope of our nation and of the world lies in a united Christendom. Our president has stated positively that America’s recovery waits upon her spiritual recovery. Your strength is needed in the organization founded to establish the kingdom of God on earth.” Well, there is no hope of a united “Christendom”. So-called “Christians” the world over are getting ready to blow one another up and gas one another and shoot one another full of holes in a grander, more glorious, more complete way than ever before. And as for sects, what about that item from Hamburg, Germany, that in that one city, in that wretched and unhappy land, in the last ten years more than 200 sects have sprung into existence that were not known prior thereto. And even in the happy days displaced, there were about 200 even then. There is only one thing on which “Christendom” is united, and that is in hatred of the pure truth and the messengers of that truth, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One Haole in Hawaii Nei </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By ‘Wialno Hurotuole’ (Hawaii)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE greatly anticipated day when Judge Rutherford would arrive in Honolulu came at last. Jehovah's witnesses and those associated with them began to assemble early in the morning, and many anxious inquiries were made at the pilot’s office concerning the delayed arrival of the steamer, which had been caused by headwinds. A large quantity of leis had been specially prepared of fragrant, beautiful flowers. These were sent down the bay on the cutter, to be presented to Judge Rutherford, with the love and greetings of all the publishers of the Kingdom message in Hawaii, and other parts of these seas. Newspaper reporters and photographers interviewed Judge Rutherford, taking many pictures which later appeared in the local papers. While this was his first visit, Judge Rutherford is well known here through his radio lectures, and by the great number of his books which are in the hands of the people in all languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the steamer docked all the friends went aboard to extend their alohas to Judge Rutherford, and to present more leis until there wasn’t room for another one around his neck. Surely it was a great day for Honolulu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was desired that everyone on this island should be reached with a personal invitation, informing them that Judge Rutherford would address a public assembly on April 14 at McKinley High School auditorium, Honolulu, on the topic “Who Shall Rule the World?” Pioneers and other publishers had come in from other islands, and even from Australia, to help in the work. Not alone the city of Honolulu, but all the outlying parts of the island, including sugar and pineapple camps, were covered with printed invitations. Large window display cards were placed in the windows of stores and business places all over the island. Also 100 copies of a full-page newspaper advertisement of the public assembly were pasted on store windows. For the week preceding the lecture, parades of autos on which large banners and signs were displayed were held daily. A trailer equipped with sound equipment and plenty of signs led the parades. A number of tire cover signs telling of the public address were placed on cars and trucks. Daily announcements were made over one of the local radio stations, inviting the people to the assembly. A great deal of interest was aroused. Of course, the Devil tried to get in his licks, but all he could do was stir up the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It had been fine and sunny until Judge Rutherford reached here, and then it immediately turned quite windy and overcast, and remained that way much of the time. Just at the time when people would be starting for the auditorium, on Sunday afternoon, it began to rain a regular downpour which lasted just long enough to keep some from coming. However, the Devil failed in his purpose; for over 1400 people were at the auditorium and heard the lecture, and thousands of others heard it in their homes over station KGMB, which broadcast the address. In that way the residents on the other islands were enabled to hear the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The audience was a noticeably intelligent one representing many nationalities, including Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, as well as some others. A large delegation of &quot;gentlemen of the cloth” were there with collars on backfront and with black and even red shirts. Some of these left rather hurriedly before the address was over, when it got rather hot for them. Great interest was manifest by the audience, and nearly all jumped to their feet and enthusiastically voted “Aye” at the conclusion. As they left the auditorium 591 booklets containing printed copies of the address and of others by Judge Rutherford were placed with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this was only a part of the witness given that day by Judge Rutherford, for that evening he spoke by invitation in the largest and oldest Hawaiian church, Kawaiahao church. The invitation was extended by the pastor and the chairman of religious activities in behalf of the board of deacons and members of the church, as the copy herewith shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The written invitation was followed by urgent verbal ones. Upon his reaching Kawaiahao church, a real Hawaiian aloha and greeting was extended to Judge Rutherford by the officers of the church, and then all joined in the Lord’s prayer. In honor of the occasion the Hawaiian people arranged a special song service; and how they did sing 1 No written music was used, even though many varied and complicated parts were sung. Each group or choir was led by a different leader, who seemed to exercise absolute control by movements of the hands and eyes. The voices were very strong, but indescribably sweet-sounding, even to the deep bass of the Hawaiian men. No musical accompaniment of piano or organ was needed. In fact, it couldn’t</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">have been heard if it had been played. It was singing that was singing, and sung to praise the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford fed them from the Lord’s Word; and when he finished, the chairman gave a resume in Hawaiian for the benefit of those who could not understand English. There were many signs of assent and interest. Those privileged to be present will not soon forget the occasion. The desire of these people to hear Jehovah’s message was opposed by the Board of Missions which controls most of the churches here, but no heed was paid to their protests, and the invitation was made despite the efforts of the Board of Missions to prevent it. The members of the Hawaiian church asked for bread, and for once they received bread and not a stone. Usually they insist that all services in their church be in the Hawaiian tongue. They intended it as a very great compliment to Judge Rutherford in inviting him to speak in their church, and the blessing of the Lord attended the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The observance of the Memorial took place on the following Wednesday, and it was a rich blessing to have Judge Rutherford to conduct the service. It was indeed a joyful and inspiring event for those present, many of whom were participating for the first time. Many other grand meetings were led by Judge Rutherford during his stay. While here Judge Rutherford, in the Lord’s providence, made many extensive provisions for the giving of a far greater witness in this place to the name and honor of Jehovah. All the publishers here are surely convinced that the Lord sent him here, and hope this was but the first of many such visits. The witness accomplished by Judge Rutherford’s visit and public addresses was far more than ordinarily would be by years of witnessing in the usual manner. When the steamer for the mainland was about to leave, many more leis of flowers were given to Judge Rutherford with heartfelt mahala nui for all he had done in behalf of the Lord’s work here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It had been hoped there would be time for Judge Rutherford to enjoy some Hawaiian scenes and food, but his time was so fully occupied in the Lord’s service that this was not possible. All were sorry to see him go, but did their best to give him a happy send-off, looking forward to an early return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking Backward—into the Future</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T SEEMS fair to conclude that our present economic misery is due to our having been “educated” by newspapers that received more revenue from printing advertisements than they did from printing intelligence. When we were in dire need of intelligence they overdosed us with advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks to the use of radio, however, public opinion is now far in advance of editorial opinion, and this lead will keep increasing as long as publications are handicapped with their draganchors of advertising revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An exception can be made in the matter of public opinion of advertising, which is 200 or more years behind the editorial opinion of conscientious journalists. In the early part of the eighteenth century editors and publishers were very proud of their professional honor, and they guarded it with as much zeal as the present-day publisher guards the profits of his corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In those days commercial advertisements were not considered the proper business of papers of intelligence, and so the advertisements were used as rear-end material to be printed after the news items, or segregated entirely from the news by being printed in a supplement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, this editorial opinion prevailed in the earlier days of journalism, long before the days when newspapers became a by-product of advertising, and long before the days of Barnum, Barton, Ballyhoo and Hokum, and long before the Ivy Lee type of clever publicity was used to manufacture public opinion for private profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in September, 1710, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Tattler </span><span class="font7">printed what is probably the outstanding editorial classic of all times regarding advertising. It was both an editorial and the publisher's statement of policy. It is an indication of what public opinion, looking backward into the future, will be when the present generation gets to know its newspapers and its periodicals better. The editorial (quoted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Tattler,</span><span class="font7"> of September 14,1710) follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is my custom, in the dearth of news, to entertain myself with those collections of Advertisements that appear at the end of the public prints. Advertisements are of great value to the vulgar. First of all they are instruments of ambition. A man that is by no means big enough for the Gazette may easily creep into the advertisements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">second use which this sort of writings has been turned to of late years has been the management of controversy. . . . The inventors of Strops for Razors</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By A. B. Walton (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">have been writing against one another in this way for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The third and last use of these writings (advertisements) is to inform the World where they may be furnished with almost anything that is necessary for Life. If a man has Pains in his Head, Cholic in his Bowels, or spots on his clothes, he may here meet with the proper Cures or Remedies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a Man would recover a Wife or a Horse that is stolen or strayed; if he wants new Sermons, electuaries, Asses’ Milk, or anything else, either for his body or for his Alind, this is the place to look for them in. (End of editorial.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, looking backward, into the future, it seems that journalistic history and public opinion will repeat, because we find Dr. Johnson, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Idler</span><span class="font7"> for January 20, 1758, expressing this opinion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Advertisements are now so numerous that they are very negligently perused, and it is therefore become necessary to gain attention by magnificence of promise and by eloquence sometimes sublime and sometimes pathetic. Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement. I remember a washball that had a quality so truly wonderful that it gave ‘an exquisite edge to the razor’. The trade of advertising is now so near to perfection that it is not easy to propose any improvements. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How does advertising in 1934 differ from that of 1758? Has not history repeated itself with a vengeance, and then some?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it any wonder that our big advertisers have to employ “public relations” experts to keep public opinion favorable? and is it any wonder that newspapers and periodicals could increase profits by keeping their readers ignorant and gullible and easy prey for the wiles of the tricky advertisers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will not public opinion, looking back to 1855, accept the soundness of the logic which Emerson recorded in his diary of that year in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ I trust a good deal to common fame, as we all must. If a man has good corn, or wood, or board, or pigs to sell, or can make better chairs or knives or church organs than anyone else, you will find a broad, hard-beaten road to his house, be it in the woods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a difference since 1855! Present-day manufacturers and merchants advertise their own fame. Their products may not be the best, nor their prices bargains, but they can advertise that they are, and the editors will keep their secrets. It was a good game while it lasted. Insull and the rank and file of speculators of all sorts can testify to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, public opinion is no longer so easily opiated by advertising superlatives, and the paid publicists are finding it harder and harder to manufacture public opinion, and the public, becoming informed, will soon say to the editors and publishers, “We are looking backward, gentlemen, into the future, and you will have to mend your ways.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Advertising, which was long considered a necessary fertilizer for the fields of business, has been spread on too thick in an effort to produce larger harvests of profits, and the public is beginning to notice the odor, and insist on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">much needed sanitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Journalism will doubtless return to its virtuous duty: that of distributing intelligence. Newspapers will then be divided into two classes: those that carry advertising and those that do not. In the former, the advertisements will probably be put where they rightfully belong: at the end of the news, or in a supplement, instead of being scattered everywhere in the paper except on page one, with the news items being used as &quot;fillers” for the space not sold to the advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mordants and Alums </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By W. M. Evans, M.P.S. (England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font7">EFERRING to Mr. Barber’s article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> of February 27, I was greatly interested in his remarks concerning &quot;athlete’s foot”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I will endeavor to give an explanation of the causes of this complaint to the best of my knowledge. Today there is an immense quantity of artificial silk in everyday use, which in the majority of cases is dyed in bright colors. What is artificial silk?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the product of cellulose, which is the main constituent of the cell walls of plants which forms the skeleton of vegetable tissues. In a pure state cellulose is best known as cotton, wool, linen, and paper. Cotton and linen differ from each other in the structure of the fibers, which consist in one case of cylindrical tubes, but chemically identical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cotton when nitrated and treated with alcohol and ether produces collodion. When this solvent is evaporated it leaves a transparent film of great tenacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon addition of dilute sulphuric acid to the above and the passing of it through a very fine aperture into water, it at once coagulates and forms a fine transparent thread of great toughness. These threads may be wound on a reel and twisted to produce a silky fiber, which is denitrated by means of ammonia sulphide to render it nonexplosive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A second method is to treat cellulose with a mixture of carbon bisulphide and caustic alkali. The viscid transparent liquid is squeezed through a fine aperture and subsequently rendered insoluble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This product is artificial silk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the dyeing process some dyes require a mordant, that is, something to fix or hold the coloring matter in the fibers of the material, while there are a small number of dyes which do not require the mordant. The most valuable mordants are the salts of aluminum, particularly alum, sodium aluminate, and aluminum hydroxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This hydroxide has the property of uniting with many soluble organic coloring matters, and precipitates them from solution, as lakes. Upon this property depends the use of aluminum salts as mordants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today the compound alum is largely used, on account of its purity, in preference to the ordinary aluminum sulphate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is clear that the material which is being dyed contains a mass of mordant in a very fine state of subdivision in an anhydrous condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alum in this condition has a great affinity for water, and immediately on coming in contact with any moist surface it slowly reacts, gradually absorbing water, and coagulating any albumen, acidic secretions are neutralized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perspiration is a secretion which occurs as free butyric acid (this is a fatty acid which is a component of butter, average about 10 percent); therefore definite action takes place between this acid and the aluminum salt, forming a new type of salt, which in turn acts as a caustic, producing redness, inflammation, and finally a painful blister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As there is a continual attraction between the aluminum salt and the moisture inside the cells, this is very marked in the delicate parts, as there is less resistance than there would be where the cell walls are thickened (as in the case of the finger tips). Trouble may also be caused if the dye enters a broken-down cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Aluminum salts taken internally react in a similar manner, the salts having contaminated any food prepared in aluminum utensils. These salts are slowly absorbed and have an accumulative action; therefore consumers possessing a strong constitution are able to take their daily dose for some considerable time before the limit is reached and the poisonous symptoms begin to show themselves, while, on the other hand, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">consumer with a weak constitution shows signs of poisoning very rapidly. Another interesting fact is that even after the daily dose ceases the pains and ill effects continue for a considerable time, as aluminum salts are very slowly eliminated from the system and with great difficulty. Very rarely is it the case that two persons show the same symptoms while dosing themselves with aluminum salts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many alums in use today, as follows :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. Alum, or potash aluminum sulphate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. Ammonia alum—ammonia and aluminum sulphate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. Potash chromium alum, or potash and chromium sulphate.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">There are a large number of alums of the other metals in existence, but very rarely used. The most common are alum and ammonia alum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The alums are a class of compounds which are the double salts of the sulphates of two bases or metals, the most important being the double sulphate of aluminum and potash known as alum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first two of the above-mentioned alums each contain aluminum as one of its constituents ; but the third one, potash chromium alum, is one which does not contain any aluminum, chromium taking its place; yet, although aluminum is absent, it is a duplicate in many respects, and, in fact, far more dangerous if taken internally. Let me give a word of warning that if </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">any future date chromium is used as a metal for the production of cooking utensils it will, in my opinion, be disastrous to use them, as compounds of chromium are highly poisonous, far more than aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I strongly condemn copper, aluminum, and, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font7">we get them, chromium vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chromium metal until recently was a great curiosity, but is now obtained very easily from its crude oxide by the aid of aluminum and also by means of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two metals are very closely allied to each other.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">New News About Nicotine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Oran Raber</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Beprinted by permission of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific Progress)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here are the true facts about nicotine. The bold, evasive advertising of cigar and cigarette manufacturers is a camouflage for the effects smoking really has upon you. The newest investigations are sure to surprise you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HAT the literary romancers </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">think</span><span class="font7"> about “My Lady Nicotine” is often very different from what the scientific research workers—the physicians and the physiologists, not to mention the sociologists—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">knoiv</span><span class="font7"> about her. Nicotine, like alcohol, is a deceiver; and its real effects upon the human system are not always what they seem to the casual observer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is interesting to note that cigars are much worse than cigarettes because (a) the tobacco of cigars is much purer, and (b) the substances mixed with cigarette tobacco lessen the amount of nicotine in the smoke. Cigar smoke contains more than twice the nicotine content of smoke compared with the same amount of tobacco in cigarettes, and pipe smoking is still worse. Dr. W. W. Henick stated in October, 1929, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">angina pectoris,</span><span class="font7"> i.e., neuralgia of the heart, w’as more common among pipe smokers than among other users of tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just exactly what the nicotine does to the body is still a subject of much research and discussion among physiologists. The human organism is such a complex mechanism that it is extremely difficult to put one’s finger on the exact part of the machinery that is influenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the more general effects were indicated by Hydan, who found that nicotine first stimulates the movement of the intestine and then later depresses it. Mulinos found that when 1.5 to 15 milligrams of nicotine w<sup>r</sup>ere injected into the veins, motion of the intestinal muscles ceased completely. Gasser and Dale also found that the muscles of mammals were paralyzed by nicotine and made insensible to stimuli. The Polish student Dobryanski showed that the epithelial cell's lining the esophagus and trachea which control the cilia that keep the passages to the lungs and stomach free from objectionable germs, dust, etc., are also paralyzed under the influence of nicotine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an experiment on rats, Field proved that every one after breathing the tobacco was more active for a short interval; but later activity decreased. This means that the animals were “more nervous”; and it was found that the excited rats weighed less at the end of the experiment than rats given uncontaminated air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hydan also found that nicotine increased the hlood pressure of subjects experimented upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adrenalin is a very powerful heart stimulant, and Tournade and Chabrol showed that nicotine stimulates the production of this drug, so that many workers thought this was the reason for the increased blood pressure. But Hydan showed that this could not be the entire cause, since the blood pressure is increased by nicotine even when the glands secreting the adrenalin have been removed. Adrenalin tends to annul the feeling of fatigue and to accelerate the recovery of tired muscles, but this action is hindered by nicotine. Thus nicotine not only causes muscles to behave as though they were fatigued, but also prevents the adrenalin from remedying the situation. The action of nicotine on the heart and blood vessels is seen to be a very complex one. Frommel showed that nicotine increased the excitability of the heart; and Hendriksson found that when administered to rabbits, tobacco smoke decreased their pulse, raised their blood pressure, and decidedly increased the work of their hearts. Tournade and his associates performed an interesting operation on two dogs in what is called a cross-circulation experiment. The blood streams of the two animals were united; one of the dogs was then chloroformed and the other was given a small dose of nicotine. The blood pressure of the chloroformed dog rose very abruptly, and then fell to almost zero, owing to the syncope or temporary heart failure of the animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor Henderson at Yale shows that the heart of an athlete must have a slow, steady stroke; and the extra demands made upon it cannot be met by increasing the beat instead of the stroke-volume. Tobacco tends to increase the beat or pulse rate, so that the heart makes a lot of small strokes instead of a few, slow, strong strokes with high volume output which the work of an athlete requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Nicotine Does to Diabetics</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nicotine also causes an increase in blood sugar both in normal subjects and in diabetics, and since this is the very thing diabetics wish to avoid, the folly of their use of tobacco is selfevident. Nicotine also has been found to decrease the alkaline reserve of the blood of dogs, men and women, owing to the production of acid intermediary by-products while the system is reacting to the toxic alkaloid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That nicotine really is toxic to organisms was shown by two investigators. They tested the effect of smoking upon the bacteria in the mouth of the smoker and found that smoking a cigarette reduced the bacteria removable by rinsing the mouth about forty percent. At the end of an hour the effect had disappeared. This means that the sterilizing action of tobacco smoke is genuine but temporary so far as the mouth of the smoker is concerned. Unfortunately, what damages the cells of the bacteria also hurts the cells of the smoker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In small doses nicotine excites respiration, but in larger amounts respiration is hindered. Nicotine is even more powerful than strychnine in producing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">apnoea,</span><span class="font7"> or restricted respiration. Nicotine has long been known to decrease the appetite, but it also hinders digestion. It distinctly hinders the digestion of proteins by the digestive enzymes of the intestinal tract and inhibits the starch-digesting power of pancreatic juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Japanese investigator, Fukuye, reports that nicotine injected under the skin or into the veins of cats caused disturbances in their hearing apparatus. Bruni showed that tobacco smoke caused a decrease in the protective action given the body by the scavengers of the blood; i.e., the white corpuscles. These guardians of the body were less efficient after smoking, due to a direct toxic action of nicotine upon these “policemen” of the blood stream.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Can a Smoking Mother Poison Her Child?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">A question arises as to whether a smoking mother may poison a nursing or unborn child. Hatcher and Crosby found that nicotine does pass into the milk of an animal containing nicotine in its blood; and a trace of nicotine was detected in the milk of a mother who smoked. Furthermore, nicotine was found to suppress milk secretion for several hours in the case of cows and cats, and there is no reason to believe that it has a different effect upon the human species. The baby of a smoking mother may, therefore, be injured in two ways: in the first place, it will not get so much milk, and in the second place, what it does receive will be slightly poisoned with nicotine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The various effects upon the heart and other organs produced by tobacco are probably not all due to nicotine. Tobacco smoke contains several other injurious substances, about ten percent of which are absorbed by the smoker. For instance, arsenic is present in numerous brands of smoking and plug tobacco, varying from six to thirty parts per million. These are many times the amounts permitted in foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The above citations have all referred to the physical effects of tobacco. As to its mental effects, it has been shown rather conclusively that smokers are poorer students than nonsmokers. But these examples are sufficient to indicate the type of work now being done in laboratories all over the civilized world—work which shows that nicotine is a poison in every sense of the word. One may reply that “a little poison is a harmless thing” or that “a little poison now and then is relished by the strongest men”. Very well, if after knowing that a thing is poison, you still persist in taking it, that is an affair for the sociologist and not for the physiologist and pharmacologist. We are merely putting the skull and crossbones on the bottle. Whether you still wish to take it, you must decide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Wine—Its Manufacture and Use Unscriptural?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">INE is a beverage or liquor made from the juice of grapes and allowed to ferment. The alcoholic content thereof produces intoxication when used to excess. There could be no wine without fermentation, and fermentation is the result of a natural law which the great Creator God made. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yah-yin</span><span class="font7"> is the Hebrew word most frequently translated “wine” in the sacred Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi’s prophecy. The word is a derivative of the Hebrew verb meaning “to effervesce”. In 83 cases out of 138 times used the Hebrew word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">yah-yin</span><span class="font7"> certainly means fermented grape juice, and in the remainder of cases it may fairly be presumed to do so. In four cases only is it really doubtful. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ti-rosh</span><span class="font7"> is the Hebrew word next most frequently used, and is translated “new wine” or “sweet wine”. Its derivation from the root meaning “to seize, occupy, possess” was evidently because the new or sweet wine was particularly intoxicating and hence </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">seized</span><span class="font7"> the drinker’s brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Genesis, the ninth chapter, it is recorded that Noah planted a vineyard, gathered the grapes that grew therein, and made wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{yah-yin)</span><span class="font7"> from them and became intoxicated. To say that Noah did that because he was ignorant of the natural law of fermentation would be foolish. The record shows that he planted the vineyard with full knowledge that wine by fermentation would result; otherwise why did he press out the juice from the grapes and wait for it to ferment before he drank it ? Had he desired only the grape juice he would have pressed out the juice and drunk it immediately. The great flood, which had occurred some years before, had nothing to do with the operation of fermentation, as has been improperly claimed. God was not displeased with Noah and did not, like modern prohibitionists, subject him to a fine, imprisonment or other punishment for making and possessing wine; but long thereafter God gave to Noah the very highest commendation, at Ezekiel 14:14. In the eleventh chapter of Paul’s letter to the Hebrews again Noah is specifically commended for his faithfulness and devotion to God, and it is plainly stated that he had God’s full approval. Notwithstanding this, Noah has been repeatedly denounced by the Anti-Saloon League and the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Later Abraham, who had performed a great and good act of faithfulness to God, was met by the king of Salem, Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, and was served with wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{yah-yin)</span><span class="font7"> by God’s priest and received God’s blessing. The record of this is in Genesis 14:18,19. During prohibition enforcement the clergy would incarcerate both Abraham and Melchizedek in prison for so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God anointed Aaron, the brother of Moses, to serve in the office of high priest of Israel and to serve in the tabernacle built for the worship of Jehovah God. In Leviticus 10:9 He commanded Aaron not to drink wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{yah-yin)</span><span class="font7"> or strong drink </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{sheh-hhahr,</span><span class="font7"> an intensely alcoholic “liquor”, an “intoxicant”), when? “When-ye go into the tabernacle.” But when the service in the tabernacle was done he might drink it. The Lord did not prohibit him from manufacturing or having it in possession. Even those who were specially consecrated to God were told that they could drink wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{yah-yin)</span><span class="font7"> at certain times.— See Numbers 6: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In giving instruction to the Israelites concerning their offerings at the tabernacle God used these words, in Numbers 28:7: “In the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[sheh-hhahr]</span><span class="font7"> to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering.” No one would question that the Lord approved this, because He commanded it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Psalm 104 the prophet is praising God for His abundant provisions for His creatures, and among other good and blessed things thus provided by the Lord he names these: “He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[yah-yin]</span><span class="font7"> that mak-eth glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.” (Psalm 104:14,15) Instead of prohibiting the making, possession and use of wine, God himself provided it for His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It cannot be successfully argued that these scriptures, because of being taken from the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, no longer apply. The entire Bible was written for the instruction of men in righteousness, and the Hebrew Scriptures and the later gospel and apostolic writings are in full accord with each other. It is written in 2 Timothy 3:16: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” Jesus and the apostles quoted frequently from the Hebrew Scriptures and showed that such announce God’s rule as applying to all His creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The words and acts of Jesus are recorded in the inspired writings of His apostles and followers. He performed miracles for the purpose of establishing the faith of the people in Him as the Messiah sent from God. Would it be at all reasonable that in the performance of miracles for this purpose Jesus would use anything in connection therewith that God had prohibited or that was at all displeasing to God? Certainly not; because He repeatedly stated that He came to do, not His own will, but the will of His Father who sent Him. (John 5:30; 6:38) Therefore what Jesus did had the full approval of God His Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first miracle that Jesus performed was that of making wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(oi-nos,</span><span class="font7"> the Greek equivalent for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">yah-yin).</span><span class="font7"> The record thereof is found in John 2:1-11. He was present at a marriage feast at which all the guests were drinking wine which the bridegroom had provided. The supply on hand was exhausted. Being called upon to do something for the guests in the way of supplying wine Jesus then and there performed His first great miracle by making wine from water. The divine record shows that it was even better than the other wine. Some of the prohibitionist clergymen, not being able to answer these plain statements of God’s approval upon the making of wine, have had the temerity to tell the people that the wine Jesus there made on that occasion was merely unfermented grape juice. The clergy expect the people to believe their statement because they claim that no one else can teach the Scriptures aside from them. In proof that it was genuine, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fermented</span><span class="font7"> wine, the record plainly reads: “The governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine [oi-mos] until now.” No man would say that about unfermented grape juice. He did not know that Jesus had made this wine, but he did know it was the best wine; and that proves it was not merely plain grape juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pharisees who composed the clergy when Jesus was on earth, and whom Jesus denounced as hypocrites, accused Jesus of being a winebibber </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(oi-no-po-tes).</span><span class="font7"> (Matthew 11:19) Manifestly they did this because Jesus indulged in the moderate use of fermented wine. Had He been drinking plain grape juice they would have said nothing about it. Had God purposed that the making, possession and use of wine should be prohibited, Jesus certainly would not have drunk any of it whatsoever. He kept God’s law in every particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pharisees accused Jesus of wrongdoing because He ate and drank with the poor or common people. They were not drinking unfermented grape juice, but were evidently drinking good wine, which represented good cheer, and this they were doing because Jesus was with them and they were glad. To illustrate the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">happiness</span><span class="font7"> of the occasion, Jesus spoke in response to the Pharisees’ accusation and used these words: “And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is better.” (Luke 5: 37-39) Who ever heard of unfermented grape juice’s causing skin bottles to burst? The clergy will have to find some other arguments; for these scriptures show that God does not prohibit the making, possession or use of intoxicating wine or strong drink, but that, on the contrary, He approves the making, possession and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">moderate </span><span class="font7">use thereof.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>Use—at Memorial</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Just before the death of Jesus He instituted the Memorial of His death by the breaking of bread and by producing wine and inviting His disciples to drink of it. Luke’s account (22: 14-20) reads: “And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.” If fermented wine were displeasing to God, then Jesus would not have used it on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s law concerning the passover and the seven-day feast of unleavened bread which followed specified: We shall eat nothing leavened </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[khaw-mates]</span><span class="font7">; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[mats-tsaw}.”</span><span class="font7"> (Exodus 12: 20) “Unleavened bread </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[mats-tsaw]</span><span class="font7"> shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[khaw-mates}</span><span class="font7"> be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven [se/i-ore] seen with thee in all thy quarters/’ (Exodus 13:7) If this prohibition against leavened bread at Passover had been meant by Jehovah God to apply also to fermented wine, then most certainly Jesus would not have permitted it at the table nor have handed the cup of it around to His disciples while celebrating the passover nor used it immediately thereafter as an emblem of His shed blood. Also all other faithful Jews would have had to dump their stocks of fermented wine or otherwise have gotten rid of it from their premises before passover night, if the command, “Neither shall there be leaven </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[seh-ore}</span><span class="font7"> seen with thee in all thy quarters,” included wine in its application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no mention of wine in connection with the passover in the Pentateuch (the first five books of Moses, or Genesis to Deuteronomy) ; but the Jewish legal code apart from the Bible strictly enjoins that there should never be less than four cups of it provided at the paschal meal even of the poorest Israelite. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Pesach.</span><span class="font7"> X, 1) The wine was usually red, and it was mixed with water as it was drunk. The cups were handed round in succession at specified intervals during the meal. Two of them appear to be distinctly mentioned in Luke’s account of Jesus’ last supper with His disciples before His death. The wine drunk at the meal was not restricted to the four cups, but none could be drunk during the interval between the third and fourth cups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the Jewish canons: “Nothing is prohibited on the Feast of Passover because of leaven except the five kinds of corn, viz., wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Leguminous plants, such as rice, millet, beans, lentils, and the like, in these there is no leaven; and although the meal of rice or the like is kneaded with hot water and covered with cloths till it rises like leavened dough, yet it may be eaten, for this is not leaven, but putrefaction. Even the five kinds of corn, if simply kneaded with the liquor of fruit, without water, are not accounted leaven. Though the dough thus made stands a whole day and rises, yet it may be eaten, because the liquor of fruit does not engender fermentation, but acidity. The fruit-liquor, oil, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wine,</span><span class="font7"> milk, honey, olive-oil, the juice of apples, of pomegranates, and the like, but no water, is to be in it, because any admixture of water, however small, produces fermentation.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maimonides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neither is the service of praise sung at the Passover mentioned in the original passover law given to Moses. It consisted of the series of Psalms from 113 to 118. The first portion, comprising Psalms 113-114, was sung in the early part of the meal, and the second part after the fourth cup of wine. This is supposed to have been the ‘'hymn” sung by our Lord and His apostles.—Matthew 26:30; Mark 14:26, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Leaven</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In Hebrew two distinct words are found, both translated “leaven” in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">King James</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Common Version</span><span class="font7"> Bible. This is not the best for the understanding, for there is the same distinction between </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">seh-ore</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">khaw-mates,</span><span class="font7"> in the Hebrew, as between “leaven” and “ferment” in the English. Chemically speaking, the “ferment” or “yeast” is the same substance in either case; but “leaven” is more correctly applied to solids, as bread dough, and “ferment” is applied both to liquids and to solids. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Seh-ore</span><span class="font7"> (“leaven”) occurs only five times in the Scriptures, in four times of which it is translated “leaven” (Exodus 12: 15,19; 13:7; Leviticus 2:11), and in the fifth, “leavened bread.” (Deuteronomy 16: 4) It seems to have denoted originally the remnant of dough left on the preceding baking, which had fermented and turned acid; hence its distinctive meaning is “fermented” or “leavened mass”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Khaw-mates</span><span class="font7"> ought not to be translated “leaven”, but “ferment”. It is a more general term than the former, and is spoken of both liquids (as wine) and solids. But leavened bread and wine (fermented grape juice) were not classified together. Note: Leviticus 2:11 commands: “No meat [meal] offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[khaw-mates} : </span><span class="font7">for ye shall burn no leaven [se/t-ore] nor any honey [which has leavening force], in any offering of the Lord made by fire.” But Leviticus 10: 9 and Numbers 28: 6,7,14 read: “Do not drink wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[yah-yin}</span><span class="font7"> nor strong drink </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[sheh-khahr} . . .</span><span class="font7"> when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die.” “It is ... a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[sheh-khahr}</span><span class="font7"> to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering. . . . Their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[yah-yiri]</span><span class="font7"> unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus commanded that His followers should continue to perform the Memorial of His death once each year until the coming of His kingdom. The fact that the Lord used wine (“the fruit of the vine”) on this occasion is conclusive proof that its making, possession and use has the approval of God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Moderation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">God made the grapes and the wine therefrom for men and purposed that men should use it in moderation and for their own good; and that being true, no body of men has the right in the name of God to prohibit the possession or use thereof. The Bible defines the qualifications of those who should be ordained to serve in the church of Christ, and, among other things, it states that such shall not be given to “much wine” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">((linos').</span><span class="font7"> (Titus 2:3; 1 Timothy 3:3-8) Manifestly this is proof that it is pleasing to the Lord for them to make and possess and use it in moderation. This instruction is given to one of God’s servants: “Use a little wine [oinos] for thy stomach’s sake.” (1 Timothy 5: 23) The law of God does not advise men to use wine to excess and become drunk; but, on the contrary, it is written, in Philippians 4:5: “Let your moderation be known unto all men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been a great amount of sorrow and suffering amongst men by reason of the excessive use of wine and strong drink. It is also true that there has been even greater suffering from other excesses. The improper and excessive eating of food doubtless has killed more people than excessive drink. The Word of God especially denounces a glutton, but it does not prohibit the people from eating in moderation. Likewise God's Word denounces the excessive use of wine or strong drink to the point of drunkenness, but it does not prohibit the manufacture, possession or use of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the use of wine is authorized by the Scriptures, but the use thereof must be in moderation. Manifestly it is proper to use wine in moderation, otherwise the Lord would not have caused to be recorded, with His approval, the use thereof. There is a wide distinction between the moderate use of wine and “filthiness of the flesh and spirit”. (2 Corinthians 7:1) Moderation in all things is the proper and Scriptural course. (Philippians 4:5) An immoderate eater is a glutton. A drunkard and a glutton are placed in the same class, and both are disapproved by the Lord. (Proverbs 23: 21; Deuteronomy 21: 20) Let it be repeated that the Scriptural admonition is to take “a little wine for thy stomach’s sake”. (1 Timothy 5: 23) But ‘do not be given to too much wine’. (1 Timothy 3:8) If one finds that he cannot take a moderate amount of wine for his well-being, then he should avoid it altogether. If it works injury to himself or to any other person, then it should not be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, . . . </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">drunkenness,</span><span class="font7"> revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians 5:19-21) “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, . , . nor </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">drunkards,</span><span class="font7"> nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.”—1 Corinthians 6: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In harmony with what is here said it is written : “Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.” (Proverbs 23:20,21) Manifestly Jesus used wine and ate food, and that furnished an excuse for the Pharisees to charge Him with being a glutton and a winebibber and a friend of publicans and sinners. Concerning this matter Jesus himself said: “The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.” (Matthew 11:19) Of course, the Pharisees </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">falsely</span><span class="font7"> charged Him with excesses, because Jesus always does right. Of His joy, flashing forth from His eyes, at the privilege of vindicating His heavenly Father’s name, it is prophetically written (Genesis 49: 11,12): “He washed his garments in wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[yah-yin],</span><span class="font7"> and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes shall be red with wine”; not bloodshot and inflamed as with drunkenness, but, as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> translation renders it, “darker his eyes than wine”; or, another translation, “brilliant,” “darkly flashing his eyes with wine.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Strong; McC. &lt;£ S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore it is written: “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.” (Proverbs 23: 31) According to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> this text reads: “Do not look on wine when it be-cometh red, when it giveth in the cup its sparkle; glideth down smoothly.” Some have insisted that this text means that no one should even look at wine; but that is an unreasonable construction of the scripture. Wine made from certain grapes is red at all times and does not change its color. When a man has imbibed wine to excess he begins to see “red”. What this text, then, really means is, as stated in modern phrase: Do not look on wine to use it when you see red, that is, when everything looks red to you. When it looks red to you and slides down easily, then it is time to let it alone; you have had enough or too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When any publisher of the message of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus is engaged in the service of the Lord, strong drink in any form should be avoided. God gave commandment to those who served in the priests’ office in these words: “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean.” (Leviticus 10: 9,10) The clear inference here is that it w<sup>r</sup>as not improper to drink moderately when not serving in the tabernacle. At feasts the Israelites were commanded to bring certain offerings unto the Lord, “and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[yah-yin}” </span><span class="font7">(Leviticus 23:13) When one is engaged in the Lord’s active service he should avoid wine and other intoxicating drinks. That is not the proper time for such things. “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the spirit.” (Ephesians 5:14-18) We are in the evil day. A strict observance of the Lord’s commands and rule of His kingdom is now necessary for those who will have His approval.</span></p>

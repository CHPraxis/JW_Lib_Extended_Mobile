The first article discusses important promises of God and the oaths he has made to keep those promises. To benefit from his promises, we must obey God and keep our promises. The second article discusses examples of people who have let their “Yes” mean Yes. It encourages baptized Christians to keep their most important promise.—Matthew 5:37.

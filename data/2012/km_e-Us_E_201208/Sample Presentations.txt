Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in September
“Many believe that God will one day judge them according to their deeds. Do you think Judgment Day is something to look forward to or to dread? [Allow for response.] Notice what this says.” Hand the householder the September 1 Watchtower, and consider together material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
The Watchtower September 1
“In many parts of the world, women suffer discrimination and mistreatment. Sadly, religious beliefs have contributed to this. Do you think God really cares about women? [Allow for response.] Notice how the Bible instructs husbands to treat their wives. [Read Ephesians 5:28, 29.] This magazine shows what the Bible reveals about God’s view of women.”
Awake! September
“Many say that life on earth will end one day, perhaps from a nuclear war or a natural disaster, such as an asteroid or global climate change. Do you think such doomsday predictions have merit, or do you think they’re just fantasy? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this comforting promise. [Read Psalm 37:29.] This magazine examines some common doomsday scenarios as well as the Bible’s reasonable version of what the future holds.”

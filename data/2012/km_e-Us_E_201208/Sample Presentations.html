Do you think such doomsday predictions have merit, or do you think they’re just fantasy? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this comforting promise. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>.] This magazine examines some common doomsday scenarios as well as the Bible’s reasonable version of what the future holds.”</p>

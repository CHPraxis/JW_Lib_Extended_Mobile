Field Service Highlights
We are happy to report six new all-time peaks during the month of March. The Bahamas reported 177 regular pioneers, 44,075 hours, and 2,306 Bible studies. The Turks and Caicos Islands reported 9,929 hours, 3,470 return visits, and 784 Bible studies. In addition to these peaks, support for the auxiliary pioneer service was excellent. Auxiliary pioneers totaled 370,804 in the United States, 551 in the Bahamas, 187 in Bermuda, and 81 in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Without question, Jehovah’s people are ‘working hard and exerting themselves’ in pure worship.—1 Tim. 4:10.

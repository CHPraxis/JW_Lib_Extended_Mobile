Adjustments to Midweek Meeting
Beginning the week of September 3, the Congregation Bible Study will be lengthened from 25 to 30 minutes. In his introductory comments, the conductor should take one minute to review the previous lesson. The timing of the Service Meeting will also be adjusted from 35 to 30 minutes. There will no longer be a separate part for announcements. Instead, any announcements should be given at the beginning of the first scheduled part. In most instances, few, if any, announcements will be necessary, and there is no need to outline what will be presented on the meeting. Announcements regarding field service and cleaning schedules, as well as greetings, should not be made. (km 10/08 p. 1, par. 4) If a lengthy announcement will be presented, it will be helpful if those participating in the meeting know in advance so that they can shorten their part.

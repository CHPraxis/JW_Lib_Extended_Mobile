<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are happy to report two new all-time peaks for May! The Turks and Caicos Islands reported 306 publishers and 3,485 return visits. Additionally, when comparing the first nine months of this service year with the same period last year, the Bahamas had an increase of 6.3 percent in regular pioneers, Bermuda had an increase of 6 percent in Bible studies, and the United States experienced an increase of 4.5 percent in regular pioneers. How encouraging to see the efforts made in reaching all with this life-saving good news.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 5:42</a>.</p>

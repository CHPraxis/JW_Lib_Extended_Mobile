“The Former Things Will Not . . . Come Up Into the Heart”
Our Creator has revealed what he will do in the near future. He states:
“Here I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.”—ISAIAH 65:17.
What are “the former things” that will not “come up into the heart”? The context shows that they are the injustice, sickness, suffering, and many other woes that plague humankind. How will those woes cease? The secret lies in the foretold “new heavens” and “new earth.”
Those intriguing terms and their significance will be explained in the public talk “The Former Things Will Not . . . Come Up Into the Heart.” The discourse will be delivered at the “Safeguard Your Heart!” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses, beginning in May in the United States and continuing around the world.
You are cordially invited to attend the convention nearest you. For specific details, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the publishers of this magazine. The Web site www.jw.org lists the convention locations in Canada and the United States.

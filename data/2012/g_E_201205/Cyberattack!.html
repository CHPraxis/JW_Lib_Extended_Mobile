<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IMAGINE a platoon of expert computer criminals using the Internet to operate networks of hijacked computers. This army of computers, known as botnets (robot networks), unleashes a barrage of malicious computer code targeting a specific nation. Within minutes, that nation’s military, financial, and commercial Web sites crash. ATMs and phone networks fail. Airplanes are grounded, and computer and safety systems at a nuclear power plant are disrupted. How would people react? What would they do? What would <em>you </em>do?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Perhaps the above scenario seems far-fetched. But according to Richard A. Clarke, the former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism, something similar could happen in real life. In fact, there have already been cyberattacks.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Perhaps you have even been a victim.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why would anyone want to launch a cyberattack? How are cyberattacks carried out? And since cybercrime against individuals is common, how can you protect yourself online?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>The Digital Battlefield</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">People launch cyberattacks for various reasons. Terrorists or governments, for instance, may try to infiltrate the computer networks of their enemies to steal secrets or to sabotage the equipment that those computer networks control. In 2010, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III admitted that foreign “adversaries” had repeatedly attacked and penetrated classified U.S. computer networks and stolen “thousands of files . . . including weapons blueprints, operational plans, and surveillance data.”<wbr />—See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102012171/24-29">“Some Recent Cyberattacks.”</a></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Computer criminals use similar methods to steal intellectual property or financial information from corporate networks and personal computers. Criminals reportedly rake in billions of dollars each year by means of fraudulent network transactions.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Criminal hackers have assembled vast armies of hijacked computers to carry out their online attacks. In 2009, an Internet security <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>firm uncovered a criminal gang that remotely controlled a global network of nearly two million computers, many of them owned by private citizens. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently estimated that 1 in 3 online computers is remotely controlled by an intruder. What about your computer? Could someone commandeer it without your knowledge?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Silent Stalkers</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Picture the following scenario. A criminal transmits a malicious program over the Internet. When the program finds your computer, it silently probes its online defenses. When it finds an unguarded door, it burrows deep into your computer and rummages around for useful information.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> The malicious program may then change or delete your computer files, e-mail itself to other computers, or send passwords, financial details, or other confidential information back to the intruder.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Computer criminals could even trick you into infecting your computer yourself! How? You may infect your own computer by opening an innocent-looking e-mail attachment, clicking on a Web page link, downloading and installing a free computer program, plugging an infected memory device into your computer, or simply visiting a questionable Web site. Each of these actions can install malicious software on your computer and bring it under the control of a remote intruder.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How can you know if your computer has been infected? It can be very difficult to detect. Your computer or Internet connection may seem very slow, your applications may not run, pop-up boxes may prompt you to install certain programs, or your computer may operate in an unusual way. If you note any of these symptoms, have a reputable technician check your computer.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>‘Consider Your Steps’</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">As nations and individuals become more reliant on computer technology, cyberattacks will likely become more common. <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>Accordingly, many nations are scrambling to beef up their digital defenses, and some are conducting large-scale exercises to test the resilience of their computer networks to attack. Still, “given enough time, motivation and funding,” admits Steven Chabinsky, a senior U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation computer security expert, “a determined adversary will always<wbr />—always—<wbr />be able to penetrate a targeted system.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">What can you do to protect yourself online? While complete online security may not be possible, you can take practical steps to make your computer more secure. (See the box “Protect Yourself!”) The Bible states: “The shrewd one considers his steps.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) Surely wise advice when you go online!</p>

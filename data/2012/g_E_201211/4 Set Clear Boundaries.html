<h2 class="inline" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Suggestions.</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="4" class="p4 sn"> <em>Recognize that “children need structure and schedules to thrive.” </em>(<em>The Single Parent Resource, </em>by Brook Noel) Child and family psychologist Barry G. Ginsberg states: “Relationships are better and less stressful when boundaries are clear.” He added: “The more explicit our boundaries, and the more clearly they are expressed, the easier relationships become.” How can you set clear boundaries?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Be firm, and be true to your word. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:37</a>) An Australian study revealed that children often misbehave when parents are unable to say no and when they constantly give in to their children. As the Bible says: “A boy [or girl] let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do not let feelings of guilt over your situation as a single parent cause you to be a permissive parent. “At times, my first reaction is to feel sorry for my two sons because they are being raised in a home without both parents,” says Yasmin, quoted earlier. But as we shall see, she did not let her feelings, which were by no means bad, override her good judgment.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Be consistent. </em>“Predictability and consistency in the application of discipline may be important for the prevention of behavioral <em>and </em>emotional difficulties in children,” says the <em>American Journal of Orthopsychiatry. </em>Yasmin states: “I sat down with my boys, and we discussed discipline. When they do wrong, I try to be consistent. That said, I have learned to listen first and then explain in a calm manner how their action has affected the family. Only then do I carry out the previously determined discipline.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Be reasonable; do not discipline in anger. </em>While you need to be firm for what is right, you also need to be flexible when the situation warrants it. “The wisdom from above”<wbr />—that is, from God—<wbr />is “reasonable,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 3:17</a>. Reasonable people do not act rashly or in the heat of anger. Nor do they always go coldly ‘by the book.’ Instead, they think first, perhaps even praying about a matter, and then they are able to act more calmly and appropriately.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Consistency, firmness, and reasonableness<wbr />—along with your good example—<wbr />will enable you to set boundaries that will make your home a true refuge for your children.</p>

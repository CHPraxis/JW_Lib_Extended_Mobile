What Children Need From Parents




 Children today are exposed to an unprecedented amount of violence as well as morally degrading practices. Hence, as never before, our little ones need moral and spiritual guidance. Where can parents turn for help in training their children? Many successful parents have turned to the Bible, recognizing that its guidance on life and moral values remains unsurpassed.
In order to help parents teach their children, Jehovah’s Witnesses have prepared the book Learn From the Great Teacher. The 48 chapters in the book include the following: “Obedience Protects You,” “Why We Should Forgive,” “Why We Should Not Lie,” “Help to Overcome Our Fears,” and “Why We Need to Work.”

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In soccer, ball control with the head<wbr />—or “heading”—<wbr />is part of the game. However, recent studies using advanced imaging techniques and cognitive tests have raised concerns over the safety of repeatedly heading a soccer ball. According to researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, U.S.A., the practice “increases the risk for brain injury and cognitive impairment.” Detectable injury was observed among amateurs who headed the ball more than 1,000 to 1,500 times a year<wbr />—which amounts to just “a few times a day for a regular player.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“Advocacy groups have raised pedestrian safety concerns for HEVs [hybrid electric vehicles],” states a U.S. Department of Transportation report. “Their concern is that HEVs seem relatively quieter and may not emit the sounds that pedestrians and bicyclists rely on for warning as [a] vehicle approaches them on the street or at an intersection.” Indeed, while performing certain maneuvers, “the HEV was two times more likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash” than conventional vehicles, says the report. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has thus proposed that hybrid and electric cars be required to emit some kind of noise while moving at low speed.</p>

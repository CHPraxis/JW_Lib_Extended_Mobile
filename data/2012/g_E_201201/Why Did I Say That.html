<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WHY IT HAPPENS</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Key scripture: </strong>“If a person never makes a mistake in what he says, he is perfect.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>) The point? <em>No one </em>has complete control of the tongue. Most can relate to Annette,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> who confides: “The speed bump between my brain and my mouth often turns into a launching pad.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>True story: </strong><em>“A friend expressed interest in some clothes I was getting rid of. Without thinking, I said, ‘I don’t think they’ll fit you.’ She replied, ‘What? Do you think I’m fat?’”<wbr />—Corrine.</em></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">To understand why <em>you </em>might occasionally lose control of your speech, try the following.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>● Identify your weakness.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">․․․․․ I tend to speak out of anger</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">․․․․․ I tend to speak without thinking</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">․․․․․ I tend to speak without listening</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">․․․․․ Other ․․․․․</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Example: </strong>“I have a problem with joking around too much, and sometimes people take what I say the wrong way.”<wbr />—Alexis.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">● <strong>Identify with whom you are most likely to slip.</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">․․․․․ A parent</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">․․․․․ A sibling</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">․․․․․ A friend</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">․․․․․ Other ․․․․․</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>Example: </strong>“It’s sad, but the people I love the most are usually the easiest to hurt,” says 20-year-old Christine. “I guess it’s just because I feel so relaxed with them that I drop my guard.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>Key scripture: </strong>“Pursue the things making for peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:19-45:14:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 14:19</a>) One way to follow that advice is to apologize.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>True story: </strong><em>“My mom died when I was ten months old and my dad was never in the picture, so I was raised by my aunt and uncle. One day when I was about 10 or 11, I was feeling really lonely and angry that my mom had died, and I felt like blaming someone. So when my aunt asked me to help her out with something, I began ranting; and by the end of it, the words ‘I hate you’ and ‘You aren’t my real mom’ came out. My aunt had this shocked look on her face. Then she walked into her bedroom and shut the door, and I could hear her crying. I felt awful. She had taken care of me and had done everything for me, and I had treated her like dirt. My uncle talked to me about what had happened, and he showed me scriptures about controlling the tongue. Afterward, I sincerely apologized to my aunt. I had to realize that I was in the wrong.”<wbr />—Karen.</em></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Below, write one reason why it might be difficult for you to apologize.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Why might apologizing make you feel better?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>Clue: </strong>Consider the principles found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:2-20:11:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:23-40:5:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 5:23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Of course, it’s good to <em>prevent </em>a situation in the first place so that you won’t <em>need </em>to apologize. How can you do that?</p>

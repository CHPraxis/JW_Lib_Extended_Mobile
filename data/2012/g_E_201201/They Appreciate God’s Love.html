<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Jesus taught us to appreciate God’s love. He said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son [Jesus], in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) God’s love for us and the thrilling prospect made possible by the gift of his Son are emphasized in the book <em>Draw Close to Jehovah.</em></p>

As I meditated on his creations, my heart was filled even more with love for him.” A woman from South Dakota, U.S.A., explained: “For over 30 years, I have had a difficult time expressing love (or feeling that I am loved). This book is helping me like no other.”</p>

They Appreciate God’s Love
● Jesus taught us to appreciate God’s love. He said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son [Jesus], in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) God’s love for us and the thrilling prospect made possible by the gift of his Son are emphasized in the book Draw Close to Jehovah.
A woman in Florida, U.S.A., wrote: “After reading chapter 5, I could not help but be in awe of Jehovah’s love, wisdom, and mighty power. As I meditated on his creations, my heart was filled even more with love for him.” A woman from South Dakota, U.S.A., explained: “For over 30 years, I have had a difficult time expressing love (or feeling that I am loved). This book is helping me like no other.”

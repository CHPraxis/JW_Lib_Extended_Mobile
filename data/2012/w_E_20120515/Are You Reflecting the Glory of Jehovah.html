<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>Why is it reasonable to expect that we can imitate Jehovah’s qualities?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">IN ONE way or another, all of us resemble our parents. Therefore, it is not surprising to hear someone say to a boy, ‘You are just like your father.’ A girl may be told, ‘You remind me of your mother.’ And children often imitate what they see in their parents. But what about us? Can we imitate our heavenly Father, Jehovah? Although we have not seen him, we can perceive his precious qualities by studying his Word, by observing his creation, and by meditating on the Scriptures and especially on the words and deeds of God’s Son, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:20</a>) It is possible for us to reflect Jehovah’s glory.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Before Adam and Eve were created, God was confident that humans would be able to carry out his will for them, reflect his qualities, and bring him glory. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong><em>Genesis 1:26, 27</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>In practicing godly devotion, we should display the qualities of the One who made us. If we do so, we have the blessed privilege of reflecting God’s glory regardless of our culture, our education, or our ethnic background. Why? Because “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What feeling can Christians experience as they serve Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Anointed Christians reflect Jehovah’s glory. The spirit-begotten apostle Paul therefore wrote: “All of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:3:18-47:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:18</a>) When the prophet Moses descended from Mount Sinai with <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments, his face emitted rays because Jehovah had spoken with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:29-2:34:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 34:29, 30</a>) Though Christians have not had such an experience and their faces do not emit rays, they beam with joy as they tell others about Jehovah, his qualities, and his wonderful purpose for mankind. Like burnished metal mirrors of ancient times, anointed ones and their earthly companions thus reflect Jehovah’s glory in their life and ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:1-47:4:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:1</a>) Are you reflecting Jehovah’s glory by your godly conduct and by your activity as a regular Kingdom proclaimer?</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>(a) Like Paul, what struggle do we have? (b) How has sin affected us?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>As Jehovah’s servants, we certainly want to honor and glorify our Creator in everything we do. All too often, however, what we desire to do is not what we do. Paul had to contend with that problem personally. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Romans 7:21-25</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Explaining why we have such a struggle, Paul wrote: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23</a>) Yes, through inheritance from sinful Adam, mankind became subject to the harsh mastery of ‘King Sin.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What is sin? It is anything contrary to Jehovah’s personality, ways, standards, and will. Sin mars a person’s relationship with God. Sin causes us to miss the mark, even as an archer can shoot an arrow but miss his target. We can sin intentionally or by mistake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:15:27-4:15:31" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 15:27-31</a>) Sin is deeply ingrained in humans and creates a barrier between them and their Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Isa. 59:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:21-51:1:21" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Col. 1:21</a>) Thus, mankind in general is completely out of harmony with Jehovah and misses the priceless opportunity to reflect God’s glory. Unquestionably, sin is the worst disability afflicting humankind.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Despite our sinful state, how can we glorify God?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Despite our sinful condition, Jehovah has proved to be “the God who gives hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 15:13</a>) He has provided the means for abolishing sin<wbr />—the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. By exercising faith in that sacrifice, we are no longer “slaves to sin,” but we are in a position to reflect Jehovah’s glory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:6-45:6:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) Maintaining this approved relationship with God guarantees us Jehovah’s blessing now as well as the future benefits of perfection and everlasting life. Although we are still sinful humans, what a blessing it is to be viewed by God as individuals who can reflect his glory!</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What must we acknowledge about ourselves in order to reflect God’s glory?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>To be in the proper position to reflect God’s glory, we must honestly recognize our sinful nature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:6:36-14:6:36" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 6:36</a>) We need to acknowledge our sinful inclinations and work to control them so that we can progress to the point of truly glorifying God. For example, if we have fallen into the dishonoring sin of viewing pornography, we must face the fact that we need spiritual help<wbr />—and take action to get it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>) This would be the first step to take in working toward a life that fully honors God. As worshippers of Jehovah, we must continually make a self-examination to determine whether we are measuring up <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>to his righteous standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:18-20:28:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 28:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:12</a>) Whatever the nature of our sinful tendencies, we must keep on curbing them so that we can reflect God’s glory.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus was the only human who ever lived and died without failing to please God and reflect His glory.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) Jehovah weighs the effort we put forth along with the progress we make, and he blesses our earnest endeavor to bring him glory.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s written Word can illuminate for us the pathway to improvement. In-depth study of the Scriptures and meditative Bible reading are essential. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>) Reading the Scriptures daily will help us to make improvement. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>James 1:22-25</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Bible knowledge is the basis for our faith and is the means of fortifying our determination to avoid grave sin and to please Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:11-19:119:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:47-19:119:48" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 47, 48</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>To reflect God’s glory, we also need to “persevere in prayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) We can and should pray that Jehovah help us to serve him in an acceptable way. To that end, we can properly ask him for holy spirit, for more faith, for strength to resist temptation, and for ability to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:13-40:6:13" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Luke 11:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> 17:5</a>) As a child depends on his father, so we need to depend on our heavenly Father, Jehovah. If we ask him to help us serve him more fully, we can have confidence that he will do so. May we never feel that we are a bother to him! Instead, in prayer let us praise him, thank him, seek his direction especially when under trial, and ask that he help us to serve him in ways that glorify his holy name.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:12-19:86:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 86:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:7" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:5-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If we are to reflect Jehovah’s glory, we must “become imitators of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1</a>) One way to imitate Jehovah is to adopt his viewpoint regarding matters. Striving to live in any other way is dishonoring to him and damaging to us. Since the world that surrounds us is under the influence of the wicked one, Satan the Devil, we must work hard to have a hatred for what Jehovah hates and a deep love for what he loves.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:13:6-5:13:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deut. 13:6-9</a>) Let us therefore have nothing to do with apostates or anyone who claims to be a brother but who is dishonoring God.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Throughout history, many people have sought the true God. Their search for him has led them down thousands of pathways, as evidenced by the diversity of religions, sects, and cults in the world today. But how can you find the true God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The book <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>can help you. One well-known writer in Mexico noted: “As books go, it is tiny, but it is immeasurably great in its essence. It can be carried in one’s pocket, but if it were found in a library of 90,000 different books, it would probably turn out to be the most important one of them all.”</p>

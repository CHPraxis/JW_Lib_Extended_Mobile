Field Service Highlights
During the month of June, the Turks and Caicos Islands reported two new all-time peaks of 309 publishers and 3,532 return visits. Also, when comparing this month with the same month last year, the number of Bible studies increased by 4 percent in the Bahamas and by 8.5 percent in Bermuda, and the total number of publishers in the United States increased by 2.1 percent. We rejoice to see so many responding to the invitation to be instructed by Jehovah.—Mic. 4:2.

Will God Provide a World Government?

This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.



1. Why does mankind need a world government?

Today, mankind’s problems are often on a worldwide scale. In some nations, most people are poor and oppressed. In others, many people seem to have more than they need. Only a global administration could distribute the earth’s resources fairly.—Read Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9.



2. Who could be trusted with a world government?

The idea of a world ruler is unpopular because no man or woman could do the job well. No human could gain the acceptance of everyone. Also, who is above being corrupted by power? The thought of a single tyrant ruling all mankind is terrifying.—Read Proverbs 29:2; Jeremiah 10:23.
Jehovah God has chosen his Son, Jesus, to rule mankind forever. (Luke 1:32, 33) Jesus has experience in living on earth. While here, he cured the sick, taught the meek, and spent time with children. (Mark 1:40-42; 6:34; 10:13-16) So Jesus is the ideal Ruler.—Read John 1:14.



3. Is a world government really feasible?

God has appointed his Son to rule the earth from heaven. (Daniel 7:13, 14) Just as a human ruler does not have to be present in every city he rules, Jesus does not need to be physically present on earth in order to rule mankind.—Read Matthew 8:5-9, 13.
Will everyone accept Jesus as Ruler? No. Only people who love what is good will accept him. Jehovah will clear the earth of those who reject the loving and righteous Ruler whom he has appointed.—Read Matthew 25:31-33, 46.



4. What will the world Ruler do?

As a shepherd gathers his sheep, Jesus is already gathering meek people from all nations and teaching them God’s ways of love. (John 10:16; 13:34) Such people become eager supporters of Jesus and his kingship. (Psalm 72:8; Matthew 4:19, 20) Worldwide, Jesus’ loyal subjects are unitedly announcing that Jesus has become King.—Read Matthew 24:14.
Jesus will soon act with power to relieve mankind of corrupt government. He has chosen some of his loyal followers to rule over the earth as kings with him in heaven. (Daniel 2:44; 7:27) Jesus’ Kingdom will fill the earth with the knowledge of Jehovah and will establish the kind of paradise that was lost at the beginning of human history.—Read Isaiah 11:3, 9; Matthew 19:28.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SOME say that it is wrong to question God. They may feel that it is disrespectful to ask why God does or does not allow certain things to happen. Is that your view?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If so, you may be surprised to learn that many good people have questioned God. Note the following examples of questions they have asked him:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The faithful man Job: <em>“Why is it that the wicked themselves keep living, have grown old, also have become superior in wealth?”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:21:7-18:21:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 21:7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The loyal prophet Habakkuk: <em>“Why is it that you look on those dealing treacherously, that you keep silent when someone wicked swallows up someone more righteous than he is?”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Habakkuk 1:13</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus Christ: <em>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:46-40:27:46" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 27:46</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">If you read the passages surrounding those quotations, you will see no indication that Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God was offended when asked such sincere questions. Really, his tolerance is not surprising. For instance, God is not insulted when we ask him to satisfy basic physical needs that keep our bodies healthy. He gladly fills those requests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:11-40:6:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Likewise, he willingly supplies information that can keep us mentally and emotionally healthy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>) In fact, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep on asking, and it will be given you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:7-40:7:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 7:7</a>) The context of Jesus’ promise shows that he was talking about receiving not only material things but also answers to important questions.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If you had the opportunity, which of the following questions would you like to ask God?</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">  Does my life have a purpose?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">  What will happen when I die?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">  Why do you allow me to suffer?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since “all Scripture is inspired of God,” you will find the answers God gives in his Word, the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) Consider both what has prompted some to ask the questions listed above and the answers that the Bible provides.</p>

PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 3-14
Jehovah wants humans to have as much freedom as possible. In these articles, note how he is teaching us to be a free people. And note how Satan is trying to take our freedom away and make us want the false freedom that the world offers.
STUDY ARTICLE 3  PAGES 15-20
Why do we continue to preach with courage even though people oppose us and there are serious economic problems in the world? Psalm 27 gives many of the reasons, and we will learn about them from this article.
STUDY ARTICLE 4  PAGES 21-26
Today, God is preparing the anointed to live in heaven and the other sheep to live in Paradise on earth. In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul calls these preparations “an administration.” Parts of this letter will help us to understand why God is doing this and what we must do.

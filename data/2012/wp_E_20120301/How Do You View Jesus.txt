How Do You View Jesus?
Are you more inclined to think of Jesus as a newborn baby, a dying man, or an exalted King?
The Bible reveals that Jesus is a powerful King. But what does this mean for you?
Many believe that Jesus died for them. Yet, how can one man’s death almost 2,000 years ago mean life for others today?
You are cordially invited to listen to Scriptural answers to these questions. This information will be presented when Jehovah’s Witnesses gather to commemorate Jesus’ death. This year the anniversary falls on Thursday, April 5, after sundown.
Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.
The weekend following the commemoration of Jesus’ death, Jehovah’s Witnesses will also present an intriguing Bible-based discourse entitled “Is It Later Than You Think?” This talk will be one of the highlights of a worldwide effort to reach out to all those who love truth and want to learn more about Jesus. You are invited to attend.

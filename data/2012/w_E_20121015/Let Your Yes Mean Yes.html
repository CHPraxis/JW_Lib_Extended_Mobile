<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>What did Jesus say about the swearing of oaths, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">GENERALLY, true Christians do not have to make sworn oaths. This is because they obey Jesus, who said: “Just let your word <em>Yes </em>mean Yes.” He meant that a person should keep his word. Jesus prefaced that command by saying: “Do not swear at all.” He said this in condemnation of the casual habit that many people have in their daily conversation of repeatedly swearing to this or to that, without ever intending to do what they say. By going “in excess” of a simple <em>Yes </em>or <em>No </em>to state their intentions, such people may reveal that they are really untrustworthy and thus under the influence of “the wicked one.”<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:33-40:5:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Matthew 5:33-37</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Explain why it is not always wrong to make sworn oaths.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Do Jesus’ words mean that all making of oaths is bad? How could that be? As we learned in the preceding article, Jehovah God and his righteous servant Abraham made sworn oaths on important occasions. Also, God’s Law required the taking of a sworn oath to settle certain disputes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:22:10-2:22:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 22:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:5:21-4:5:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Num. 5:21, 22</a>) Thus, it may be necessary for a Christian to swear to tell the truth when testifying in a court of law. Or, on a rare occasion, a Christian might find it necessary to make a sworn oath to assure others of his intentions or to help settle a matter. In fact, when Jesus himself was put under oath by the high priest, he did not object to it but responded truthfully to the Jewish Sanhedrin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:63-40:26:64" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 26:63, 64</a>) Jesus, however, did not need to swear to anyone. Even so, to emphasize the reliability of his message, he often introduced what he said in this unique way: “Most truly [literally, “Truly, truly,” ftn.] <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>I say to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:51-43:1:51" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:16-43:13:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:20-43:13:21" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 20, 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:38-43:13:38" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 38</a>) Let us see what else we can learn from the examples of Jesus, Paul, and others whose <em>Yes </em>meant Yes.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) No other human has ever volunteered to shoulder such a heavy responsibility.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>To what extent did Jesus let his <em>Yes </em>mean Yes?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus always practiced what he preached by letting his <em>Yes </em>mean Yes. He allowed nothing to sidetrack him from the commission he received from his Father to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom and to make disciples of all whom God drew to Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) The Bible describes the extent of Jesus’ truthfulness in these well-known words: “No matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:20-47:1:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:20</a>) Indeed, Jesus is the finest example of one who proved true to what he promised his Father.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What example did the apostle Paul set for us?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup><em>“What shall I do, Lord?” </em></strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:22:10-44:22:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 22:10</a>) With these sincere words, Paul, then known as Saul, responded to the direction of the glorified Lord Jesus, who had appeared to him in a vision to stop him from persecuting Christ’s disciples. As a result of this encounter, Saul humbly repented of his past course, got baptized, and accepted the special assignment given to him to bear witness about Jesus to the nations. From that time onward, Paul continued to address Jesus as his “Lord,” acting in harmony with that expression until the end of his earthly life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:22:6-44:22:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 22:6-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:5-47:4:5" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:8-55:4:8" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:8</a>) Paul was not like others of whom Jesus said: “Why, then, do you call me ‘Lord! Lord!’ but do not do the things I say?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:46-42:6:46" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 6:46</a>) Yes, Jesus expects all who accept him as their Lord to be true to their word, as was the apostle Paul.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) Why did Paul change his plan to revisit Corinth, and why were his critics not justified in questioning his trustworthiness? (b) How should we view those appointed to take the lead among us?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Paul zealously spread the Kingdom message throughout Asia Minor and into Europe, establishing and revisiting many congregations. On occasion, he found it necessary to swear to the truthfulness of what he wrote. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:1:20-48:1:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gal. 1:20</a>) When some in Corinth accused Paul of being untrustworthy, he wrote in his defense: “God can be relied upon that our speech addressed to you is not Yes and yet No.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:18-47:1:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:18</a>) At the time of writing that, Paul had left Ephesus and was traveling through Macedonia on his way to Corinth. Originally, he had planned to revisit Corinth before going into Macedonia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:15-47:1:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:15, 16</a>) But, as with traveling overseers today, sometimes routings have to be changed. Such changes are not made for trivial, selfish reasons but because of some emergency. In Paul’s case, the reason he delayed his planned visit to Corinth was for the congregation’s own good. How so?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Some time after making his original plans, Paul received disturbing news that disunity and immorality were being tolerated in Corinth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:11-46:1:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:1-46:5:1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>) To correct the situation, he wrote strong counsel in his first letter to the Corinthians. Then, instead of sailing directly from Ephesus to Corinth, Paul decided to give his brothers time to apply his counsel so that when he eventually arrived, his visit could be more encouraging. Assuring them of the truthfulness of the reason for his change in plans, Paul wrote in his second letter: “I call upon God as a witness against my own soul that it is to spare you that I have not yet come to Corinth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:23-47:1:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:23</a>) May we never be like Paul’s critics; rather, let us show our deep respect for those appointed to take the lead among us.

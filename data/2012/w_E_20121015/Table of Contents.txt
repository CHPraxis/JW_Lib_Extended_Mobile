PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 7-11
We live in a time of great adversities. This article will help us to learn from ancient and modern examples of those who have faced dire circumstances. It will also show us how we can be courageous and positive no matter what comes our way.
STUDY ARTICLE 2  PAGES 12-16
Today’s world is filled with a spirit that tears down rather than builds up. In this article, learn how to avoid attitudes and actions that are damaging to the congregation and how to cultivate the spirit that promotes good relations with others.

The first article highlights precious promises that God has sworn to fulfill. To benefit from his promises, we must obey him and be true to our word. The second article highlights examples of humans who have let their Yes mean Yes and encourages baptized Christians to be true to their most important Yes.—Matt. 5:37.

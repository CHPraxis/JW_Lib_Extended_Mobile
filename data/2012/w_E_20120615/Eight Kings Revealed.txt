Eight Kings Revealed
Taken together, the Bible books of Daniel and Revelation not only identify eight kings, or human rulerships, but also show the sequence in which they would appear. We can decipher those prophecies, as we understand the very first prophecy recorded in the Bible.
Throughout history, Satan has organized his seed into various political movements or kingdoms. (Luke 4:5, 6) However, only a relatively few human kingdoms have exerted a major influence on God’s people, whether the nation of Israel or the congregation of anointed Christians. The visions of Daniel and John describe a total of only eight such great powers.

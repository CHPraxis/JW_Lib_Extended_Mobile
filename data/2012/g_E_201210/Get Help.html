<p data-pid="8" class="p8 sb"> Perhaps a trusted family friend can help you. Such an arrangement can have a twofold benefit: First, you will get the assistance you need; and second, you will learn to rely on support when necessary<wbr />—a practice that will benefit you in adulthood. The fact is, success in most endeavors is a team effort, not a solo performance.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:22</a>.</p>

He gestured and walked from one side of the room to the other as he spoke. He got everyone involved in class discussions. If you didn’t understand a point, he patiently explained it until you <em>did </em>understand. He repeatedly told us that he <em>welcomed </em>our questions. He said that questions would not only help him see what we didn’t understand but also help him become a better teacher. He took a personal interest in everyone. Many students chose to pursue a career in accounting<wbr />—the field he taught—<wbr />after spending just one year in his class!”<wbr /><em>—Alana, Australia.</em></p>

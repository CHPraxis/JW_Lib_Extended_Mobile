The articles will help you to answer these questions: Are Bible prophecies merely the work of clever humans? Do they bear the hallmark of divine inspiration? We invite you to weigh the evidence.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">WE LIVE in difficult times. From all parts of the earth, we hear a steady stream of news describing calamities and social unrest. Is there any special significance to the current world situation?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some 2,000 years ago, the Bible foretold that the world’s troubles would climax in “the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>) This does not mean “the end of the world” as people fear it. Rather, the Bible describes a pattern of events and attitudes, or a sign, that would occur during a time period called “the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Jesus told his followers that when they saw “these things occurring,” relief would soon follow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:31</a>) Consider some of the prophecies that mark our time as unique.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Fulfillment: </strong>In the early years of the 20th century, many were expecting continued peace.

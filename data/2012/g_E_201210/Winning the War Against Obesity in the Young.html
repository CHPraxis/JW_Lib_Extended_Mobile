<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ACCORDING to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, between 1980 and 2002, the number of overweight adolescents tripled and the number of overweight preteens more than doubled. Long-term increased risks associated with childhood obesity include high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Childhood obesity may be related to a number of factors, including a sedentary lifestyle, advertising campaigns directed at young people, and the availability and affordability of unhealthy foods. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says: “Childhood obesity is the result of eating too many calories and not getting enough physical activity.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Children, adolescents, and adults would do well to take a close look at their eating habits. Without going to extremes, a few simple measures can make a difference. Consider, for example, a young man named Mark, who found that adjusting his eating habits brought enormous benefits to his health and well-being. “At one time I was a junk-food junkie,” Mark admits. <em>Awake! </em>spoke with Mark to find out how he changed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>When did your problem with food begin?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When I graduated from high school. About that time, I began eating out a lot. There were two fast-food restaurants near the place where I worked, so I ate lunch at one or the other almost every day. I found it much easier to go to a fast-food restaurant than to prepare my own lunch.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>What about when you moved away from home?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">My eating habits got worse. I didn’t know how to cook, and I didn’t have much money; but my favorite fast-food restaurant was just two blocks away. Eating there seemed like the easiest and cheapest option. In addition to eating the wrong kind of food, I ate <em>way too much </em>food. I wasn’t satisfied with a standard fast-food <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>meal. I ordered <em>more </em>French fries, a <em>larger </em>soft drink, and an <em>extra </em>hamburger<wbr />—whatever I could afford—<wbr />in the largest size available.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>What was the turning point for you?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When I was in my early 20’s, I started thinking more seriously about my health. I was overweight. I felt sluggish all the time, and I lacked self-confidence. I knew that I needed to make changes.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>How did you get your eating under control?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I took a gradual approach. First, I reduced the <em>amount </em>of food I ate. I would tell myself, “This isn’t my last meal; I can always eat again.” At times I literally had to walk away from the dinner table. But I felt good afterward, as if I had won a victory.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>Did you have to make any drastic adjustments?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Some things I gave up completely. For example, I eliminated soft drinks and drank only water. That was difficult. I loved soft drinks, and I hated water. After I drank a glass of water, I would take a couple of sips of juice, which put some flavor on my palate. After a while, water itself became more appealing.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>What did you do besides eliminating unhealthy foods?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">I replaced them with better options. I started with fruits<wbr />—apples, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and melons. I also added lean proteins to my diet, such as chicken or tuna. In time, those foods became some of my favorites. I try to eat more vegetables and less of the rest of the main course. I find that I’m less likely to overeat at mealtime if I have healthy snacks between meals. Over time, my craving for junk food has diminished.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>Did you completely give up eating out?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">No, I still do go out to eat occasionally. But when I do, I control how much I eat. If the portion I’m served is too big, I ask for a take-out box. Then I put half of the meal in the box before I start eating. That way, I consume a reasonable portion instead of eating more, simply because I feel guilty about leaving food on my plate.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>How have you benefited from the adjustments you have made?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">I’ve lost weight, and I have more energy. I feel better about myself. Best of all, I’m happy to know that by taking care of my health, I’m honoring the God who gave me the gift of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) I used to think that living a healthy lifestyle would be boring. But now that I’ve started to eat right, I wouldn’t trade it for the world!<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

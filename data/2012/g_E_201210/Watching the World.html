<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Research indicates that “city dwellers respond more violently to stress than do people from small towns,” says the Polish magazine <em>Przekrój. </em>“Cities are places of exposure to an excessive number of stimuli,” explains psychotherapist Mieczysław Jaskulski of Warsaw’s Psychoeducation Laboratory. “For city dwellers, the risk of anxiety attacks is 21 percent higher than for those living in the countryside, and for mood disorders, 39 percent higher.” How can city dwellers cope? “Do not get upset about things that are beyond your control,” “leave work at work,” “go out for a walk,” and “do not be afraid to take a vacation,” suggests <em>Przekrój.</em></p>

Facebook sent him a CD containing 1,222 pages of data. As reported by the German newspaper <em>Der Tagesspiegel, </em>the student said: “Everything had been stored<wbr />—every message, every chat, including sensitive information about friends.” Included was information that he was sure he had deleted!</p>

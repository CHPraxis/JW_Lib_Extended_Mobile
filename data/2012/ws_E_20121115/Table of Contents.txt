PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 3-8
This article shows how King David of ancient Israel had great respect for Jehovah’s name, or reputation, and His purpose. David had also learned principles from God’s Law and asked Jehovah to teach him to do His will. This article also shows us why we should always try to think as Jehovah thinks.
STUDY ARTICLES 2, 3  PAGES 9-20
True Christians know that they need to be humble as Jesus was. In the first article, we will learn about Jesus’ example of humility so that we can imitate him. The second article explains how we can behave as a lesser one and be humble.
STUDY ARTICLES 4, 5  PAGES 21-32
These articles will assure us that Jehovah is willing to forgive even very serious sins. Sometimes it is difficult for us to want to forgive other people. But lessons in the Bible can help us to be more willing to forgive.

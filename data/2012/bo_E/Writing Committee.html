<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>1. </strong>The Web Publishing Department maintains the organization’s websites. It works with departments at world headquarters and in the branches to develop Web content in many languages. This material includes answers to <span class="underline">Bible </span>questions raised by the public, information about our headquarters and branches, and news releases about events involving Jehovah’s Witnesses. Selected publications can be read online or downloaded in various digital, audio, and video formats.</p>

<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Writing Archives</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>2</strong>. Writing Archives is <span class="underline">a work group within the Writing Department that is </span>responsible for gathering, cataloging, and preserving material related to our theocratic history. Archival records and artifacts come from branches, congregations, individuals, and secular institutions. The Archives collection includes publications, clippings, documents, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and other items of historical value. Detailed life histories of longtime servants of Jehovah are also kept on file. Over time, such material is being digitized in order to provide electronic access and avoid damage to the original items. Archival research is used in preparing material for publication, display, and other educational purposes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>3. </strong>Many branches have assembled similar items during the preparation of <em>Yearbook </em>accounts and for other projects. The Writing Committee is interested in the preservation of such material, either at individual branches or at world headquarters. Consideration should be given to the proper organization and storage of such items, thus increasing their value for future research and publication. Such archival work should not be cared for by the Writing Desk. It may be assigned to another Bethel department, such as the Bethel Office.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>WRITING DESKS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>4. </strong>The Governing Body has approved the setting up of Writing Desks in a number of branch offices. This arrangement has these objectives: (1) publish articles that reflect an understanding of local cultures found in various parts of the earth, and (2) distribute the writing workload.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>5. </strong>A Writing Desk should consist of an overseer, one or two writers, and a secretary. The work of all Writing Desks comes under the oversight of the Writing Department at world headquarters. The Branch Committee can decide whether additional staff is needed to handle replies to inquiries received from the field that deal with Scriptural doctrine and our published material. Brothers who handle such correspondence, whether assigned to a Writing Desk, the Service Department, or another department, may be granted access to the Writing Desk research library. (See letter dated HWC:EB October 31, 2014, No. C-33138W.) Branch Committees need to obtain approval from the Writing Committee before either adding or reassigning permanent writers whose main work is to handle writing assignments for our publications. If a permanent writer is invited to attend Gilead School, please inform the Writing Committee.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>6. The Writing Desk overseer </strong>is <span class="underline">expected to work closely with the Writing Department at world headquarters. He is </span>to supply copy to the Writing Department according to the schedule and instructions received from the Writing Department. If the Writing Desk overseer wants to contact other branches to request information not available locally, he will first ask the Writing Department which branches are available to handle such requests. After that, he should send copies of such correspondence to the Writing Department.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">7</span>. <span class="underline">Before articles are written, </span></strong><span class="underline">preview </span>outlines should be submitted for approval <span class="underline">with a cover memorandum</span>. A <em>Preview Outline </em>form can be found on MDS in the “Other Materials” section. The Writing Desk overseer and a Branch Committee member should be convinced that an outline is satisfactory before submitting it. When a writing assignment is made, the length of the article is specified. Suggestions may also be made as to what the article may include. The writer may make limited changes in the outline as he works on the article.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">8</span>. </strong>The Writers’ Workshop is the principal means by which individuals are identified and approved to write for our publications. When a Writers’ Workshop is scheduled to be held at a branch, the Writing Committee may invite that branch to supply names of individuals living in the branch territory who may have potential as writers. <span class="underline">Writers from other branches may also be enrolled. </span>It will then be determined by the Writing Committee who will be invited to attend the class. Those recommended as potential writers should have writing ability and must be baptized, spiritually mature, and in good standing. They should be balanced, exemplary, modest, and not inclined to talk freely about their writing activity. In most cases, writers should be elders. Anyone assigned to write an article should be given a copy of <em>Writing for Our Publications </em>(A-41). Although it is not required that the writer read the English <em>Standards Manual, </em>he <span class="underline">will likely </span>find it beneficial to become familiar with some of its content. The Writing Desk overseer should be well-acquainted with it and should apply its standards to copy that is submitted to the Writing Department.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">9</span>. </strong>All writers should be conscious of the target audience for the publication for which they are writing:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section6" class="section">
<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong><em>Awake!</em></strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Readers of <em>Awake! </em>typically have little or no knowledge of the Bible. They may know nothing about Christian teachings, they may be somewhat distrustful of religion, or they may be unaware that the Bible has practical value. A primary objective of <em>Awake! </em>is to convince its audience that God exists. This journal also aims to help the reader to build faith in the Bible and to understand that Jehovah’s Witnesses are different from other religious groups.</p>

<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong><em>The Watchtower​—</em>Public Edition</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This journal focuses more on spiritual matters because its target audience may have a measure of respect for God and for the Bible. They have some knowledge of the Bible but do not accurately understand its teachings. Many readers of the public edition are not familiar with Witness terms and concepts. If such are used in articles, they should be explained.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section8" class="section">
<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong><em>The Watchtower​—</em>Study Edition</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">This edition is written primarily for Jehovah’s Witnesses as well as for those who attend our meetings, are familiar with the Scriptures, and understand Witness terms and concepts.</p>

<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>The JW.ORG Website</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">10</span>. </strong><span class="underline">Since many people who visit jw.org are non-Witnesses, Witness terms and concepts should be either avoided or explained. </span>Each branch without a Writing Desk, along with the countries it oversees, is assigned by the Writing Department to a particular Writing Desk. At times, with the Writing Department’s direction, a Writing Desk may contact these branches in order to identify stories that could be used as a basis for an article in the ABOUT US > ACTIVITIES section of the website. Articles in this section typically cover newsworthy events or experiences with the objective of helping the reader learn about the fine works of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">11</span>. Remain alert to what is happening in the branch territory. </strong>When an event occurs that would be of interest to our readers (for example, if a natural disaster strikes), please forward this information promptly to the appropriate Writing Desk. <span class="underline">The Writing Desk will then review the information to determine if it is suitable for the ABOUT US > ACTIVITIES section. If it is, the Writing Desk will prepare an outline of the proposed article and submit it to the Writing Department.</span></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>12. Time to do the work of writing varies. </strong>Those not in full-time service can do their writing in the time they have available. The Writing Desk overseer and anyone who may be working with him full-time are expected to do such work during working hours. Other Bethel family members assigned to write articles may be asked whether they can do so on their own time or will need to use some work time. Evenings or weekends may be used for this work, but no one should be discouraged from asking permission to use some work time for such an important assignment. The Branch Committee can grant a Bethelite, a missionary, a special pioneer, or a regular pioneer a time allowance for writing. Some writing assignments may not require much time, whereas more time may be needed for others. It is best for a missionary or a special pioneer to care for a writing assignment within a single calendar month.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>13. Field <span class="underline">service </span>experiences </strong><span class="underline">that are outstanding may be sent to the Writing Committee for possible use</span>. At times, the Writing Department may request that your branch submit a life story. Be sure that a worthwhile point is made by either the experience or the life story. Regarding the qualifications of those featured in life stories, see <em>Writing for Our Publications </em>(A-41), <a class="xt" data-xtid="53" href="jwpub://p/E:1200041/22-22">paragraph 17</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p28" data-pid="28"><strong>DOCUMENTING ARTICLES</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong>14. </strong>Throughout an article, <strong>place reference numbers in brackets </strong>after quotations and facts requiring documentation. Attach separate reference pages listing the sources after the corresponding numbers. Mnemonics should be used to identify Watch Tower publications. This information is useful in many ways, and having it may even determine whether an article is published. For details and a sample reference page, see <em>Writing for Our Publications </em>(A-41). For articles containing quotations from newspapers, magazines, books, or sources other than the <em>New World Translation, </em>send electronic copies, with English translations if needed. Keep the originals for translation work or other use. If a certain quotation appeared previously in our literature, state where it was used.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">15</span>. An article must be accurate in every detail, </strong>and that responsibility rests chiefly with the writer. When the Branch Committee coordinator, another Branch Committee member, or the Writing Desk overseer reads the article and sees something that raises a question, that point should be checked with the writer or looked up to make sure it is correct. If it is wrong, delete it or make a correction. Clarify ambiguous statements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section11" class="section">
<h2 id="p31" data-pid="31"><strong>SUBMITTING ARTICLES</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">16</span>. </strong>Before submitting an article to the Writing Department, the Writing Desk overseer should <strong>read the article very carefully </strong>and <span class="underline">evaluate </span>it in the light of what is said in <em>Writing for Our Publications </em>(A-41). The article should be worthy of publication. Also have in mind the possible <strong>effect of the article on people living in the local territory. </strong>Sometimes it is best not to say certain things, even though they are true. Do not submit material for publication that might cause difficulty for our brothers locally or elsewhere. Many things can be written that will not hurt our work and may even engender goodwill. The truth should be presented, of course, but in a tactful way.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong>17. </strong>If possible, <strong>send photographs with an article, </strong>as these help the Art Department to prepare good illustrations. Photographs should be accompanied by signed releases, as explained in <em>Writing for Our Publications </em>(A-41), <a class="xt" data-xtid="54" href="jwpub://p/E:1200041/89-89">paragraph 58</a>. If you learn that a model in a photograph that you supplied has become disqualified, please follow the guidelines provided in the letter dated HWC:HWG <span class="underline">September 28, 2017</span>, No. C-<span class="underline">54749W</span>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>18. </strong>Articles and related materials should be submitted electronically via the Materials Distribution System (MDS) by accessing “Transfers” under the “Writing Transfer” section. Detailed submission guidelines are available on MDS. If electronic submission via MDS is not possible, articles and related materials may be submitted with a covering numbered letter via branch mail.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><strong>19. </strong>Every article sent to the Writing Department should be dated and must bear the <strong>names of the branch and the writer and the names or signatures of the Writing Desk overseer and the Branch Committee member who reviewed it </strong>to indicate that the article is approved for publication.</p>

<h2 id="p42" data-pid="42"><strong>Starting Translation Into a New Language</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb"><strong>22. </strong>The Branch Committee regularly reviews the spiritual needs of every language group under its care. The Service Department is responsible for determining what publications are really needed and which priority list (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H) best fits the situation of each language in the branch territory. <strong>[See </strong><a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1011001/294-333"><strong>Chart 8.1</strong></a><strong>.] </strong>The findings are presented to the Branch Committee. <strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><strong>23. </strong><span class="underline">In consultation with the Service Department, </span>the Translation Department recommends potential translators to the Branch Committee, which then approves those who qualify. The candidates should (1) be baptized, (2) know the target language very well​—<span class="underline">perhaps as </span>their mother tongue—​and (3) be available for some weeks to receive training and to translate their first publications. They may come from varying backgrounds (male, female, older, younger, single, married, and so forth).​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1011011/53-53">7:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb"><strong>24. </strong>The Branch Committee requests permission from the Writing Committee to translate some of the publications specified on the priority list. It is essential to include the completed <em>New Language Translation Request </em>form. (The form is available on the Publication Processing Documentation (PPD) site, under TRANSLATION > TRANSLATION AND LANGUAGE OVERSEERS > GENERAL.) <span class="underline">Be sure to specify the format(s) being recommended for the publications and which priority list applies to that language.</span></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb"><strong>25. </strong>All new translation teams must receive training before beginning translation. Therefore, specify whom you recommend to provide the training. This will usually be an experienced translator who can teach the translation techniques course. If you do not have someone qualified to do this, please request assistance from the Writing Committee.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><strong>26. </strong>Once permission is granted, arrange for training to be given where the translators are located, so that they do not need to travel far. Where possible, train more than three candidates in order to have enough translators to choose from for future projects. Provide equipment and accommodations for the trainer. The trainer teaches the candidates basic translation techniques and works closely with them as they translate their first publications.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb"><strong>27. </strong>The translated publications are reviewed by a panel of native speakers to ensure natural language. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1011001/104-104">8:<span class="underline">53c</span></a>.) The translation is corrected and proofread, and the project team gives the translated publications a final check. The publications are composed or, in the case of audio publications, recorded. When the project is completed, the temporary translators return to their previous assignments and the Service Department provides direction on how the publications are to be used in the field and monitors how they are received. <strong>[<span class="underline">2</span>]</strong></p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb"><strong>28. </strong>When the Branch Committee requests additional publications in a language that has a temporary team, the request should be accompanied by a report as outlined by instructions from the Service Committee. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1011022/201-204">6:<span class="underline">149</span>-<span class="underline">152</span></a>.) There is no need to request permission from the Writing Committee to translate public talk outlines and material for assemblies and conventions. <span class="underline">Videos that are part of the annual convention materials or that are for JW Broadcasting may be translated into any language if you have adequate personnel and resources to handle the work without neglecting other priority translation projects. </span>However, if you have begun translating these items in a language for the first time, please inform the Writing Committee.

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb"><strong>30.

<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb"><strong>32. Sign-Language Translation: </strong>When starting translation into a sign language, a procedure is followed similar to that for spoken languages. The Writing Committee provides a separate priority list for sign languages and arranges for training when permission is given for the first publication in a sign language.

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb"><strong>33. Bible: </strong>Translating the <em>New World Translation </em>involves years of work. Languages approved to translate the Bible are allowed to have additional project teams, a secretary, and an elder to serve as the translation coordinator for the duration of the Bible project. The Branch Committee usually recommends the most qualified translators for Bible translation teams, made up of both brothers and sisters. It is permissible to use younger translators if they are well-qualified. <strong>[<span class="underline">7</span>] </strong>If you do not have enough qualified translators to translate the Bible and at the same time keep up with the approved publications, it may be necessary to produce fewer public magazines or to delay the release of other publications in order to complete Bible translation first. When the Writing Committee gives permission to translate the Bible, it arranges for initial and periodic training of the Bible translators by Writing Committee representatives. Branch Committees may request additional training when needed. Special consideration is given to add temporary teams for languages that work on the Study Edition of the Bible and/​or <em>Insight on the Scriptures. </em><strong>[<span class="underline">8</span>]</strong></p>

<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sb"><strong>40. <span class="underline">JW Broadcasting (JWB): </span></strong><span class="underline">The Governing Body views the material on JWB as spiritual food. Each language (including sign languages) approved to translate the full JWB program has a brother serving as a permanent translator in order to coordinate the translation work. Two part-time commuters (not temporary volunteers) should be assigned to work with him on a translation team. Based on the need, he may enlist the help of additional part-time commuters and remote volunteers to sustain regular production. When translating a JWB program, careful attention should be given to the main talk; experienced translators should be used for this part. As is the case with all videos, you should decide whether to translate the audio track or to use subtitles, depending on the preferences of the target audience, the technical possibilities, and the workload of the team. (For example, some languages will record a vernacular version of original songs, while others will simply provide subtitles.) If time permits and they have the necessary skills, this team may work on translating regional convention and assembly outlines. </span><strong>[<span class="underline">14</span>]</strong></p>

<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">44</span>. Schedules: </strong>Local schedules for translating new and dated publications are based on the schedules for English publications provided by the Writing Department.

<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">56</span>. The language overseer ensures </strong>that every publication is clean and press-ready before printing files are mailed to the file maintenance branch or digital media files are uploaded. He does this by making sure that all the necessary steps in the workflow are properly followed and that all involved in the process are thoroughly trained. Once the text leaves the translators for final composition, it should not be recalled for translation adjustments, except for changes needed because of correction notices. The goal is to send to the printing branch press-ready materials that can be printed without further correction. In exceptional cases, with approval from the Publishing Committee, publications may be printed locally. Audio publications are usually recorded locally.</p>
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="sb"><strong><span class="underline">57</span>. </strong>Printing branches do not proofread or perform mechanical checks on publications they print for other branches.

<p id="p334" data-pid="334" class="se"><strong>Priority List Guidelines</strong></p>
<p id="p335" data-pid="335" class="sc">The information below will help clarify the chart “How to Identify Language Needs.” These guidelines are provided to help you decide <strong>what publications </strong>may be requested for every printed and audio language that you translate. Separate information is provided about sign-language translation.</p>
<p id="p336" data-pid="336" class="sc">Please do not make a list of all languages in your branch territory with the goal of providing literature in each language. Rather, let the field determine in which language publications are needed and what is needed. Each language group has its own unique needs. For example, some languages need only audio publications, while others additionally need printed publications. Also, some languages need only publications for field service, while others also need publications for meetings. These guidelines will help you balance literacy, education levels, language needs of individuals, priorities for the ministry, priorities for meetings, and several other factors. Focus on languages where people want to learn the truth in their language and where our publishers are getting results in the field.</p>
<p id="p337" data-pid="337" class="se">The priority list is divided into the following five groups:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p338" data-pid="338" class="s5">Group 1: Publications to introduce people to the good news and to invite them to Public Meetings</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p339" data-pid="339" class="s5">Group 2: Publications used to conduct Bible studies and direct students to Jehovah’s organization</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p340" data-pid="340" class="s5">Group 3: Publications to deepen people’s love for God and assist them to make a dedication</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p341" data-pid="341" class="s5">Group 4: Publications to strengthen the congregations and help the brothers grow to maturity</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p342" data-pid="342" class="s5">Group 5: Deeper study books and the Bible</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p343" data-pid="343" class="se"><strong>Explanation of the questions at the top of the chart</strong></p>
<p id="p344" data-pid="344" class="se"><strong>1. Can most benefit from another language?</strong></p>
<p id="p345" data-pid="345" class="sc">Some language groups are familiar with the main language of the country, which they may learn at school, or with a lingua franca that they use to communicate with people from other language groups. Although they use their own language when conversing with each other, they can easily use publications in another language for reading and during meetings.</p>
<p id="p346" data-pid="346" class="se"><strong>2. How many can read their own language?</strong></p>
<p id="p347" data-pid="347" class="sc">Many individuals in some language groups cannot read at all. Also, some language groups use their own language when conversing with each other, but they prefer to use the “school language” for reading. This question is to determine whether the majority of speakers of that language can read or not, and thus whether we need to provide audio publications. It is important to recognize that some languages will never need any printed publications, but they will need audio publications.</p>
<p id="p348" data-pid="348" class="se"><strong>3. Are there congregations in this language?</strong></p>
<p id="p349" data-pid="349" class="sc">If there is very little response from a language field and there are no congregations in that language field, we will provide minimal material.</p>
<p id="p350" data-pid="350" class="se"><strong>Priority Lists</strong></p>
<p id="p351" data-pid="351" class="sc">Every language has its own priority list (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H) that is determined by a variety of circumstances. Here is a brief explanation of each of these priority lists:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p352" data-pid="352" class="se"><strong>Priority A: </strong>This language group needs all publications (audio, video, print). This language may have thousands of publishers, many congregations, and circuits. The publishers are readers, and the majority are completely dependent on publications in this language.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p353" data-pid="353" class="se"><strong>Priority B: </strong>This is a new language field. No congregations have been formed. Only basic publications for the field are needed. If this field remains unresponsive, very few publications need to be provided.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p354" data-pid="354" class="se"><strong>Priority C: </strong>The publishers and public do not read their own language. This is an audio-only language.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p355" data-pid="355" class="se"><strong>Priority D: </strong>We are just starting to cultivate this field, and there are no congregations. This is an audio-only language.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p356" data-pid="356" class="se"><strong>Priority E: </strong>Even though they are literate in their own language, this language group is not strictly dependent on their own language for spiritual food. They can comfortably use publications in another language for meetings. (For example, language groups that are fluent with the official language of the country, such as Spanish, Swahili, or French.) However, if there are many established congregations and circuits, the Branch Committee should assess the situation and decide whether to recommend publications in the language.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p357" data-pid="357" class="se"><strong>Priority F: </strong>This language group is not strictly dependent on their own language. There are no congregations. We are just starting to cultivate this field. They are quite comfortable with publications in another language. At this point it is not necessary to provide publications for meetings in this language.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p358" data-pid="358" class="se"><strong>Priority G: </strong>Few can read their own language, but they can read printed literature in another language. There are few or no secular printed publications in this language, and/​or illiteracy rates are high in the field. Publishers need audio publications for the ministry. Although there are many congregations using this language for the ministry, they use printed publications of another language during the meetings.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p359" data-pid="359" class="se"><strong>Priority H: </strong>People of this language group cannot read their own language. No congregations have been established. They need only a few audio publications for the ministry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p360" data-pid="360" class="se"><strong>What Publications to Translate</strong></p>
<p id="p361" data-pid="361" class="sc">Translation in new languages starts from the top of the list. Generally, most of the publications in Groups 1-3 will be translated, but it is not necessary to translate all the publications of a group at once. Months might elapse between translation sessions of part-time translators to allow the field to respond. Temporary translation teams convene to translate the next publications on the priority list only when the field provides sufficient evidence that additional translation is needed.</p>
<p id="p362" data-pid="362" class="se"><strong>Translation Personnel</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p363" data-pid="363" class="s5">             Only part-time volunteers are used to translate the publications in Groups 1-3.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p364" data-pid="364" class="s5">             Although permanent translation teams are formed according to the number of publishers, <strong><em>not more than one new team is formed at a time.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p365" data-pid="365" class="se"><strong>First Translation Effort</strong></p>
<p id="p366" data-pid="366" class="sc">Candidates with some potential to translate are invited to convene at a facility close to where they live, such as a Kingdom Hall, Assembly Hall, RTO of another language, branch office, or another available facility. The branch sends an experienced trainer who teaches them how to translate, field-test, and record basic publications. After three weeks or so, when the project is completed, the candidates return to the field and the translated publications are produced and used in the ministry as directed by the Service Department.</p>
<p id="p367" data-pid="367" class="sc">Before recommending that additional publications be translated, the Service Department should request from the circuit overseers answers to the following questions and then pass on the reports of the circuit overseers to the Branch Committee:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p368" data-pid="368" class="s5">             What is the response from the field?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p369" data-pid="369" class="s5">             How many Bible studies are being conducted using publications in this language?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p370" data-pid="370" class="s5">             How many attended the Public Meetings that have been held in this language?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p371" data-pid="371" class="s5">             Are the publishers who speak this language attending the meetings and preaching in the field, thus showing their commitment to develop this language field?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p372" data-pid="372" class="sc">If the response is good, the Branch Committee may recommend translating additional publications.</p>
<p id="p373" data-pid="373" class="sc"><strong>Note: <em>If there is no response from the field, do not continue to translate into that language.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p374" data-pid="374" class="se"><strong>Second Translation Effort</strong></p>
<p id="p375" data-pid="375" class="sc">After obtaining permission to translate more publications, the branch sends a trainer who assembles candidates as done previously. He may train the same candidates or, if more suitable ones became available, he trains them and produces the approved publications in a few weeks. As before, the translators return to the field and the translated publications are used in the ministry as directed by the Service Department. Again, the Service Department will communicate with the circuit overseers to monitor the response in the field and will pass on the reports of the circuit overseers to the Branch Committee.</p>
<p id="p376" data-pid="376" class="se"><strong>Further Translation Efforts</strong></p>
<p id="p377" data-pid="377" class="sc">Depending on the proficiency of the translators, the response from the field, and the availability of translators, the trainer may convene the part-time candidates after the branch obtains permission to produce additional publications. After two or three translation cycles, the following questions need to be answered to determine whether translation should continue:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p378" data-pid="378" class="s5">             How many Bible studies are being conducted?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p379" data-pid="379" class="s5">             Are students progressing to baptism?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p380" data-pid="380" class="s5">             How many meetings are regularly conducted, and how regularly do the students attend meetings?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p381" data-pid="381" class="sc"><strong>Note: <em>If there is limited response from the field, do not continue to translate into that language.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p382" data-pid="382" class="sc">If the response from the field is good, the Branch Committee should recommend that publications that can assist people to progress toward baptism be translated.</p>
<p id="p383" data-pid="383" class="sc">If brochures are translated, only one brochure at a time should be translated. Afterwards, the team members should return to the field. By that time, the trainer should have a good idea of the potential of the part-time translators.</p>
<p id="p384" data-pid="384" class="sc">Where practical, and if there is a demand, more than one team of part-time translators can work on brochures. If there are no part-time volunteers available, translation will be suspended until such time as they are available.</p>
<p id="p385" data-pid="385" class="sc"><strong>Note: </strong>The <em>Teach Us </em>book does not have to be translated in one sitting. It may be translated chapter by chapter as brochures, or the summary sheets can be translated separately. Photocopies of the translated materials can be made locally and used until the whole book is translated.</p>
<p id="p386" data-pid="386" class="sc"><strong>Note: <em>None of the part-time volunteers will work permanently in translation. </em></strong>When they complete a project, they return to the field and may be invited to convene again some time later.</p>
<p id="p387" data-pid="387" class="sc">As the field grows to more than 100 publishers and more publications are provided, a permanent team may need to be appointed to translate dated publications, such as the <em>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook </em>and the study edition of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>
<p id="p388" data-pid="388" class="se"><strong>Permanent Teams</strong></p>
<p id="p389" data-pid="389" class="sc">Appointing a permanent team is a major step for a language. Before recommending translation of dated publications, please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p390" data-pid="390" class="s5">             Does the language have a considerable number of congregations needing literature <strong><em>for the meetings?</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p391" data-pid="391" class="s5">             What evidence convinces you that the language group needs the study edition of <em>The Watchtower </em>in its language?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p392" data-pid="392" class="s5">             Are the <strong><em>ones attending the meetings completely dependent on the literature in their language </em></strong>in order to prepare for meetings and to have a meaningful share in the meetings?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p393" data-pid="393" class="sc">When a permanent translation project team is formed, the team will still operate from the Kingdom Hall or other available facility. The permanent team can be supplemented with part-time volunteers, according to their availability and circumstances.</p>
<p id="p394" data-pid="394" class="sc">The housing and working quarters of permanent teams are provided according to the guidelines provided by the Worldwide Design/​Construction Department.</p>
<p id="p395" data-pid="395" class="sb"></p>

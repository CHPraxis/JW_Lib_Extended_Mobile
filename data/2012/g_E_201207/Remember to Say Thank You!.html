<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN was the last time you received a thank-you note? When was the last time you <em>sent </em>one?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In this world of cyber communication, handwritten messages of gratitude have become something of an endangered species. Yet, saying “thank you” in writing is a special way to let people know that you appreciate their kindness. The following are some suggestions on how to do so.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sm"> <strong>1. </strong>Handwrite the note to give it a personal touch.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sm"> <strong>2. </strong>Address the recipient by name.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sm"> <strong>3. </strong>If you received a gift, name the gift and tell how you plan to use it.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sm"> <strong>4. </strong>Restate your thanks in closing.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A thank-you note makes a good impression on the recipient.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So the next time someone is hospitable to you, does a kind act, or gives you a gift, show that you do not take that one’s efforts for granted. Remember to say <em>thank you!</em></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su">● Refer to monetary gifts indirectly. For example, rather than specify the amount that you received, you could say: “Thank you for your generous gift. I plan to use it for . . .”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="su">● Include only information that relates to the gift and your appreciation for it. This is not the time to give a detailed account of your summer vacation or of your recent trip to the hospital.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="su">● Do not complain about any problems you had with the gift. For example, it would be unkind to write, “Thanks for the toaster<wbr />—but it doesn’t fit on my kitchen counter!”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="se"><strong>[Box on page 29]</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sc">The Bible promotes a spirit of thankfulness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:11-42:17:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 17:11-19</a>) It admonishes us to “pray incessantly” to God, adding: “In connection with everything give thanks.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:17-52:5:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18</a>.</p>

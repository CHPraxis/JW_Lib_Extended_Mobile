<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The opening articles in this issue of <em>Awake! </em>discuss a yearning that people the world over feel<wbr />—a yearning for a better world. Is there any hope that you will ever see such a thing?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The publishers of this magazine, Jehovah’s Witnesses, believe that the Bible holds the key to understanding what the future holds. It is the only sacred book that traces the history of mankind back to its beginning. The Bible also tells us where we are heading<wbr />—and it is <em>not </em>to the bleak future that many envision.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Would you like to learn more about what the Bible says on this topic? The book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>can help you. It is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses and is now available in 244 languages.</p>

A Changed World—Will You Ever See It?
● The opening articles in this issue of Awake! discuss a yearning that people the world over feel—a yearning for a better world. Is there any hope that you will ever see such a thing?
The publishers of this magazine, Jehovah’s Witnesses, believe that the Bible holds the key to understanding what the future holds. It is the only sacred book that traces the history of mankind back to its beginning. The Bible also tells us where we are heading—and it is not to the bleak future that many envision.

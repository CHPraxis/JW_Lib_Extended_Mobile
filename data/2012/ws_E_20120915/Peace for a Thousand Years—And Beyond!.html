This has caused much pain and suffering to mankind. Long ago, the Bible said: “Man has dominated man to his injury.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>) What is happening today? There are wars and rebellions. There are such problems as poverty, sickness, the destruction of the environment, climate change, and more.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Everybody wants to have his own home, a place where he can feel safe and secure with his family. But in today’s world, it is difficult to find a place to live. Many people are packed into crowded cities. They may have to live in shantytowns or in old, dirty buildings. They can only dream of having their own home.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When the Kingdom rules the earth, everyone will have his own home.

Today, some people live in their own home, and some even have a very big house. But they worry that they will not be able to afford it anymore. Or they worry that burglars or other criminals will break in. When the Kingdom rules, no one will worry about these things.

But we should not try to get our dream home now and go deep into debt to get it. We would be wise to live in a way that shows we are focused on Jehovah’s promise.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What did Jehovah command about the relationship between humans and animals?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Jehovah began to create things on earth, he created humans last. He told his Master Worker, Jesus, why he created humans: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) God commanded Adam and Eve to take care of the animals and have authority over them. Eventually all humans were to have that authority.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How do animals behave today?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Is it possible for humans to have authority over all the animals and to be at peace with them? Many people love their pets, such as dogs and cats. But what about wild animals? Scientists who have lived close to wild animals and studied them have found that all mammals have emotions. We know that animals become frightened and angry when they are threatened, but can they show affection? The scientists said that when mammals raise their young, they show great tenderness.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">Humans will have authority over all the animals and will be at peace with them</p>
</div>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How will animals be different in the future?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So we should not be surprised that the Bible says there will be peace between humans and animals. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 11:6-9;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:25-23:65:25" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <strong>65:25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Why should we not be surprised? Remember that when Noah and his family came out of the ark after the Flood, Jehovah told them: “A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth.” Now many animals run away from humans to protect themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:9:2-1:9:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 9:2, 3</a>) But Jehovah can remove some of that fear, so that the relationship between humans and animals will be exactly as he had commanded in the beginning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/28:2:18-28:2:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hosea 2:18</a>) What an enjoyable time that will be for everybody who will live on earth!</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Solomon saw that many bad things were being done on earth and that many people had no one to help them. So he said with great sadness: “Look! the tears of those being oppressed, but they had no comforter.” <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:4:1-21:4:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>) Today things are similar, or even worse. Who of us has not cried for some reason? Sometimes we cry because we are happy. But most of the time, we cry because our heart is full of sorrow.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Which story in the Bible especially moves you?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Think about the many stories we read in the Bible of people who cried. When Sarah died at the age of 127, “Abraham came in to bewail Sarah and to weep over her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:23:1-1:23:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 23:1, 2</a>) When Naomi said good-bye to her two daughters-in-law, “they began to raise their voices and weep,” and then “they raised their voices and wept some more.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:1:9-8:1:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ruth 1:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:1:14-8:1:14" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 14</a>) When King Hezekiah was very sick and it seemed that he would die, he prayed to God and “began to weep profusely.” Jehovah saw his tears and healed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:20:1-12:20:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:1-5</a>) And we are all moved by what happened when the apostle Peter denied Jesus.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Because so many sad things happen to people, humans need comfort and relief. During the Thousand Year Reign of Christ, God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>) It is wonderful to think that there will be no more pain and suffering.

Think back to the time in Eden when Adam and Eve were a part of Jehovah’s peaceful family. Jehovah, the Universal Sovereign, ruled directly over all those he created, whether they were in heaven or on earth. They could communicate with Jehovah, worship him, and be blessed by him. He was “all things to everyone.”</p>

Then comes “the end,” that is, the end of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ. What will happen then? Even though Jesus has been given “all authority” in heaven and on earth, he does not want to be equal to Jehovah.

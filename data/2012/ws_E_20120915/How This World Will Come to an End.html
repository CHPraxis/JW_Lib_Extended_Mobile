<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">SHOCKING things will soon happen on earth. We can believe this because Bible prophecies prove this to be true. So we need to keep on the watch. What will help us to do that? The apostle Paul encourages us to “keep our eyes, not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.” We need to remember that Jehovah will give us everlasting life, whether in heaven or on earth. Paul wrote these words to encourage Christians at his time to focus on the reward they would get for being faithful to God. Doing this would also help them to endure trials and persecution.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:8-47:4:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:16-47:4:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:7-47:5:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 5:7</a>.</p>

Just before the day of Jehovah begins, world leaders will be saying “Peace and security!” This could be one event or even several events that happen one after the other. Nations may think that they are close to solving some of their big problems. What will the religious leaders do? They are part of the world. So it is possible that they will say “Peace and security!” along with the political leaders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1, 2</a>) By doing this, the religious leaders would be acting the same way as the false prophets of ancient Judah did, who were saying: “There is peace! There is peace!” But Jehovah said there was no peace.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:6:14-24:6:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:23:16-24:23:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 23:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What will happen next? Paul said: “Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ <strong>then </strong>sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.” The destruction begins with the attack against all false religion in the world. The Bible calls false religion “Babylon the Great,” or “the harlot.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:5-66:17:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:15-66:17:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15</a>) That attack against all false religion, including Christendom, is the beginning of the “great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:8-53:2:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>) Many people will be surprised when this happens. <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Why? Because until that time, the harlot will think that she is “a queen” who will “never see mourning.” She thinks that nothing bad will happen to her. But she will suddenly find out that she has made a mistake. She will be destroyed very quickly, as if “in one day.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:7-66:18:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 18:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The Bible says that a “wild beast” with “ten horns” will attack the harlot.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Bible prophecy also shows how this attack will begin. In some way Jehovah will cause the political leaders “to carry out his thought,” or to do what <strong>he </strong>wants them to do, which is to destroy the harlot. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:17-66:17:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 17:17</a>) Religion spreads war and continues to cause many problems in the world. So the nations may think that it will benefit them if they destroy the harlot. In fact, when the rulers attack the harlot, they will think that they are doing what <strong>they </strong>want to do. But God will be using them to destroy all false religion. So one part of Satan’s system will attack another part of his system, and Satan will not be able to do anything to stop it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:25-40:12:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 12:25, 26</a>.</p>

What should we do? We should pray, study God’s Word and meditate on it, and tell others about the Kingdom message. That will keep our hope of everlasting life strong.

They include Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. And the last world power exists in our time. In Daniel’s prophecy, we learn that the feet and toes of the image represent this world power. During World War I, Britain and the United States started working together in a special way. So the fifth part of Daniel’s image is the Anglo-American World Power. The feet are the last part of the image. This shows that there will be no human world power after it. The feet and the toes are made of iron and clay.

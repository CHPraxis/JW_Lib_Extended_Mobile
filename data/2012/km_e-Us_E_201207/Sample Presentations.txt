“Today people often picture Jesus as he was two thousand years ago, either as a baby in a manger or as a man hanging from a torture stake. However, what do you think Jesus is doing now? [Allow for response.] Notice what this says.” Hand the householder the August 1 Watchtower, and consider together material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.

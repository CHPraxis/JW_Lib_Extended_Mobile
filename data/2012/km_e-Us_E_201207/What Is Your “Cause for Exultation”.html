<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What cause for exultation do we have at the end of each month?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When the end of each month arrives and all are asked to submit their field service report, what is <em>your </em>“cause for exultation”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:4</a>) Whether we are special pioneers reporting 130 hours in the ministry or publishers approved to report in 15-minute increments, all of us should rejoice in our whole-souled service to Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:100:2-19:100:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 100:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. Why should we exert ourselves in Jehovah’s service?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>As the Sovereign Lord of the universe, Jehovah deserves the very best we have to give. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:1:6-39:1:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mal. 1:6</a>) Out of love for him, we have dedicated our lives to do his will. Thus, at the end of the day or at the end of the month, if we are confident that we have given the “firstfruits” of our time, talents, and strength in Jehovah’s service, then we personally have cause for exultation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:9-20:3:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 3:9</a>) If, however, our conscience bears witness against us, then we should consider what we can do to improve.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:15-45:2:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. Why is it unwise to compare ourselves with others?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>“Not in Comparison With the Other Person”: </strong>It is unwise to compare ourselves with others or with ourselves when we had greater vitality. Circumstances change. Abilities vary. Comparisons often lead to competition or feelings of worthlessness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gal. 5:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 6:4</a>) Jesus did not make comparisons. Rather, he gave commendation in accord with what a person was able to do.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:6-41:14:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 14:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. What valuable lessons can we learn from Jesus’ parable of the talents?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In Jesus’ parable of the talents, each worker received talents “according to his own ability.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:15-40:25:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 25:15</a>) When the master returned and requested a report on their activity, those who had worked diligently in accord with their abilities and circumstances received commendation and entered into the joy of their master. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:21-40:25:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 25:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:23-40:25:23" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 23</a>) As we similarly stay busy in the work of Kingdom preaching, we can be confident of divine approval and have cause for exultation!</p>

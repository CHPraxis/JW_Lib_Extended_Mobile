Field Service Highlights
We rejoice to report two new all-time peaks during the month of February. Bermuda reported a peak of 520 total publishers, and the Turks and Caicos Islands reported a peak of 304 total publishers. In addition, when compared to the same month last year, the Bahamas had an increase of 8.1 percent in return visits and the United States had an increase of 5.4 percent in return visits. Clearly, with the guidance of Jehovah’s spirit the good news continues to spread.—Acts 1:8.

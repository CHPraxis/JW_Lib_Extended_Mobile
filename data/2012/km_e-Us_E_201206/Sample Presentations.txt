Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in July
“In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in angels. Do you think angels are real? [Allow for response.] Notice what this says.” Hand the householder the July 1 Watchtower, and consider together material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
The Watchtower July 1
Read Psalm 65:2. Then say: “Many agree with this, that God is the ‘Hearer of prayer,’ and pray every day. But others wonder, ‘If God exists, why does the world have so many problems?’ What do you think? Is there a God who hears our prayers? [Allow for response.] This magazine discusses the Bible’s answer to this question: ‘Why does the Hearer of prayer allow suffering?’”
Awake! July
“If you could change one thing about our world, what would it be? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows why humans are limited in what they can accomplish. [Read Jeremiah 10:23.] This magazine explains what God purposes to change.”

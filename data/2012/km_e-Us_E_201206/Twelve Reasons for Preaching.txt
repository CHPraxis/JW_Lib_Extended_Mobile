Twelve Reasons for Preaching
Why do we preach and teach the good news? Is it primarily to help honesthearted people onto the road to life? (Matt. 7:14) That is the first reason listed below, but it is not our primary one. Which of the following 12 reasons for engaging in the ministry do you think is the most important?
 1. It helps save lives.—John 17:3.
 2. It serves to warn the wicked.—Ezek. 3:18, 19.
 3. It contributes to the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.—Matt. 24:14.
 4. It is an expression of God’s righteousness. No charge can be brought against Jehovah that he destroyed the wicked without giving them opportunity to repent.—Acts 17:30, 31; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4.
 5. It allows us to discharge our debt to give spiritual help to people purchased with the blood of Jesus.—Rom. 1:14, 15.
 6. It enables us to avoid bloodguilt.—Acts 20:26, 27.
 7. It is a requirement for our own salvation.—Ezek. 3:19; Rom. 10:9, 10.
 8. It demonstrates love for neighbor.—Matt. 22:39.
 9. It shows obedience to Jehovah and his Son.—Matt. 28:19, 20.
10. It is part of our worship.—Heb. 13:15.
11. It expresses our love for God.—1 John 5:3.
12. It contributes toward the sanctification of Jehovah’s name.—Isa. 43:10-12; Matt. 6:9.
Of course, these are not the only reasons we engage in the ministry. For example, preaching strengthens our faith and also gives us the privilege to be God’s fellow workers. (1 Cor. 3:9) However, the most important reason for sharing in the ministry is number 12. Regardless of the response we receive, the ministry contributes toward the sanctification of God’s name and gives Jehovah a reply to the one who is taunting him. (Prov. 27:11) Indeed, we have compelling reasons to ‘continue without letup teaching and declaring the good news.’—Acts 5:42.

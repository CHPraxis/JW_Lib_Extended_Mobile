<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">EARTHSHAKING events will soon occur. The fulfillment of Bible prophecies confirms this fact, so we need to keep on the watch. What will help us to do that? The apostle Paul urges us to “keep our eyes . . . on the things unseen.” Yes, we need to bear in mind our reward of everlasting life, be it in heaven or on earth. As the context shows, Paul wrote these words to encourage fellow believers to focus on the happy outcome of their faithful course. Doing so would also help them to cope with trials and persecution.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:8-47:4:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:16-47:4:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:7-47:5:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 5:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What yet unseen event will take place next? Paul stated: “Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ <em>then </em>sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.” The first phase of this “sudden destruction” is the attack against “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion, also known as “the harlot.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:5-66:17:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 17:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:15-66:17:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15</a>) That attack against all forms of false religion, including Christendom, is the start of the “great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:8-53:2:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 2:8</a>) For many, this event will come as a surprise. Why? Because up to that point, the harlot will confidently view herself as “a queen” who will “never see mourning.” But she will suddenly discover that she has miscalculated her chances of survival. She will be wiped out rather quickly, as if “in one day.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:7-66:18:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 18:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>God’s Word identifies the harlot’s <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>attacker as a “wild beast” with “ten horns.” A study of the book of Revelation shows that the wild beast refers to the United Nations (UN). “The ten horns” represent all present political powers that support this “scarlet-colored wild beast.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 17:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:11-66:17:12" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) How devastating will the attack be? The nations of the UN will plunder the harlot’s wealth, expose her real character, devour her, and “completely burn her.” Her destruction will be final.<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:16-66:17:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 17:16</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Bible prophecy also indicates what will trigger this attack. Somehow Jehovah will put it into the hearts of political rulers “to carry out his thought,” namely, to devastate the harlot. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:17-66:17:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 17:17</a>) Warmongering religion continues to be a disruptive force in the world; hence, the nations may feel that destroying the harlot is in their own national interests. In fact, when the rulers attack, they will think that they are carrying out their own “one thought.” In reality, however, they act as God’s tool for obliterating all false religion. Thus, in a stunning reversal, one part of Satan’s system will attack another part, and Satan will be powerless to prevent it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:25-40:12:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 12:25, 26</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Knowing in advance about this attack on God’s people does not make us overly anxious. Rather, our main concern is, not our own salvation, but the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the vindication of his sovereignty. In fact, Jehovah declared more than 60 <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>times: “You will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:6:7-26:6:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezek. 6:7</a>; see footnote.) Hence, we look forward with intense interest to the fulfillment of that outstanding aspect of Ezekiel’s prophecy, trusting that “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:9-61:2:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:9</a>) Meanwhile, we want to use every opportunity to strengthen our faith so that we will be able to keep our integrity to Jehovah no matter what tests we may face. What should we do? We should pray, study God’s Word and meditate on it, and share the Kingdom message with others. By doing so, we keep our hope of everlasting life firm, like “an anchor.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 6:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:25:21-19:25:21" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ps. 25:21</a>.</p>

A study of Daniel’s prophecy shows that this final world power is depicted in the image as the feet and toes. During World War I, Britain and the United States forged a special partnership. Yes, the fifth part of Daniel’s image is the Anglo-American World Power. The feet form the last part of the image, indicating that no other human world power will appear on the scene. That the feet and toes are made up of iron and <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>clay pictures the weakened state of the Anglo-American World Power.</p>

However, a parallel Bible prophecy shows that “the kings of the <em>entire </em>inhabited earth” will be lined up against Jehovah on “the great day of God the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:19-66:19:21" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 19:19-21</a>) Hence, not only the kingdoms of the image but also all other kingdoms of this world will be destroyed at Armageddon.</p></div>

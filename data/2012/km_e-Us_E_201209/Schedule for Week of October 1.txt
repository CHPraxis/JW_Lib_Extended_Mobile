15 min: How Did We Do Last Year? Talk by the service overseer. Review the congregation’s activity during the past service year, focusing on the good things that were accomplished, and give appropriate commendation. Interview one or two publishers who enjoyed fine experiences. Mention one or two aspects of the ministry that the congregation can work on during the coming year, and offer practical suggestions.
10 min: Ideas for Offering the Magazines in October. Discussion. Take 30 to 60 seconds to relate why the magazines will have appeal in your territory. Then using the cover series of The Watchtower, invite the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask, and then invite suggestions on a scripture to read. Do the same for the cover series of Awake! and, if time allows, for one other article from either magazine. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I used to have doubts about God’s existence. Yet, sometimes I would pray anyway. I was unsure if anyone was listening, but I must admit that I did hope that someone was out there. I was unhappy and had no purpose in life. I was afraid to believe in God because I thought that only weak people believed in God.”<wbr />—PATRICIA,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> IRELAND.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">CAN you relate to Patricia’s feelings? Do you pray even if you have doubts about whether God exists? If so, you are far from alone. Consider the following.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">▪ A poll of 2,200 British people revealed that only 22 percent believe that there is a personal God who created the world and who hears prayers. Yet, of those polled, 55 percent pray at least occasionally.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">▪ A survey of 10,000 people on four continents showed that of the respondents who describe themselves as atheists, almost 30 percent pray.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Why Do They Doubt?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">An Englishman named Allan says: “I used to say that I didn’t believe in God because I thought that religion was invented to control people and to make money. Also, if there were a God, I reasoned, then there would not be so much injustice. Yet, sometimes I would sit quietly and talk to ‘something.’ I would also ask myself, ‘How did I get here?’”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Each person with such feelings has his own reasons for doubting whether prayers are answered. In many cases, the doubts may be fueled by unanswered questions, such as the following:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">▪ Is there a Creator?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">▪ Why is religion so often an influence for bad?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">▪ Why does God allow suffering?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If you could know the answers to those questions, would you feel more confident about praying?</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How thankful we can be that our loving heavenly Father has revealed the truth to us! His Word shows us the best way to live and how to get the most out of life. It protects us from vain and harmful pursuits, liberates us from bondage to religious lies, and leads us to true peace of mind. It gives meaning to our lives now and provides a marvelous hope for the future.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The truth unites us with millions of our brothers throughout the earth. Most important, Bible truth teaches us about Jehovah and shows us how we can draw close to him. Let us never take for granted what Jehovah has given us. May we rejoice in the truth and let it guide us in all our ways.</p>

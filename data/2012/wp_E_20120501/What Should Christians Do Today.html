<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TRUE Christians today do not participate in politics. Why not? Because they follow Jesus’ example. He said about himself: “I am no part of the world.” Regarding his followers, he stated: “You are no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:14</a>) Consider some reasons why Christians should not become involved in politics.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>1. Human ability is limited. </strong>The Bible states that humans have neither the ability nor the right to govern themselves. “It does not belong to man who is walking,” wrote the prophet Jeremiah, “even to direct his step.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just as humans were not created to fly successfully on their own strength, so they were not created to rule successfully by themselves. Speaking about the limits of government, historian David Fromkin noted: “Governments are composed of human beings; therefore they are fallible and their prospects are uncertain. They exercise a certain power, but only a limited one.” (<em>The Question of Government</em>) No wonder the Bible warns us not to put our trust in man!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>2. Wicked spirit forces currently have an influence. </strong>When Satan offered Jesus world rulership, Jesus did not deny that the Devil had the power to offer him all the kingdoms of the world. In fact, on a later occasion, Jesus called Satan “the ruler of the world.” Some years later the apostle Paul described Satan as “the god of this system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) Paul wrote to fellow Christians: “We have a wrestling . . . against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:12</a>) Behind the scenes, wicked spirit forces are the real rulers of this world. How should that fact influence our view of politics?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Think of this comparison: Just as small boats are swept along by powerful sea currents, human political systems are pulled along by powerful, wicked spirit forces. And just as the sailors in those boats can do little to change those powerful currents, politicians <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>can do little to change the influence of those powerful spirit forces. Those forces are bent on corrupting humans beyond reform and on causing “woe for the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>) Therefore, real change can be brought about only by a person who is more powerful than Satan and his demons. That Person is Jehovah God himself.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:7-24:10:7" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:10-24:10:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>3. True Christians give allegiance only to God’s Kingdom. </strong>Jesus and his disciples knew that at a set time, God himself would establish a government in heaven to rule over the entire earth. The Bible calls this government God’s Kingdom and reveals that Jesus Christ has been appointed as its King. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) Since that Kingdom affects all humans, Jesus made “the good news of the kingdom of God” the main subject of his teachings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) He also taught his disciples to pray: “Let your kingdom come.” Why? Because under that Kingdom, God’s will is sure to be done in heaven and on earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What, then, will happen to man-made governments? The Bible answers that the governments “of the <em>entire </em>inhabited earth” will be destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:19-66:19:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 19:19-21</a>) If an individual truly believes that God’s Kingdom is about to remove all man-made political systems, he logically would refrain from supporting those political systems. After all, if he tried to prop up doomed, man-made governments, he would, in effect, be taking a stand against God.</p>

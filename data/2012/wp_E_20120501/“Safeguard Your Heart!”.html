<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sa">“Serve Jehovah With a Complete Heart”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 CHRONICLES 28:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible mentions the heart nearly a thousand times. On most occasions, the Scriptures speak, not of the literal human heart, but of the figurative heart. What is the figurative heart? The term can refer to the inner self<wbr />—what a person thinks, feels, and desires.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Why should we safeguard our figurative heart? God moved King Solomon to write: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:23</a>) The quality of our life now and our prospects for future life depend on the condition of our figurative heart. Why? Because God sees what is in our heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) It is the kind of person we are inside, in the “secret person of the heart,” that determines how God feels about us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">How can we safeguard our heart? The answer to that question will be discussed in depth during the conventions that Jehovah’s Witnesses will be holding around the world beginning this month. You are warmly invited to attend all three days of this convention.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> What you learn will help you to act in a way that makes Jehovah God’s heart rejoice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

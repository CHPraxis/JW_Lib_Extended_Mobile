<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“My heart often pounds really hard, and I break out in a cold sweat and find it difficult to catch my breath. I am overcome by feelings of dread, anxiety, and mental confusion.”<wbr />—Isabella, a panic disorder sufferer in her forties.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ANXIETY can be described as “a feeling of nervousness or worry.” Have you, for example, ever felt nervous when confronted by an angry dog? What happens when the dog goes away? The nervousness and worry do too, don’t they? What, though, is an anxiety disorder?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When anxiety becomes chronic, when it continues even after there is no more need to feel anxious, anxiety can become a disorder. According to the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), “anxiety disorders affect about 40 million American adults age 18 years and older . . . in a given year.” Consider Isabella, quoted in the introduction. Unrelenting anxiety, such as she experiences, can have serious consequences for the sufferer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Not only that, but the immediate family may also be affected adversely. There is good news, though. An NIMH publication states: “Effective therapies for anxiety disorders are available, and research is uncovering new treatments that can help most people with anxiety disorders lead productive, fulfilling lives.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>Family and friends can also help one who is suffering from an anxiety disorder. How?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Be supportive: </strong>Monica, who suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, explains a difficulty she faces: “Most people find it hard to understand my emotional problems.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As a result, anxiety disorder sufferers are often so afraid of being misunderstood that they try to hide their problem from others. This can result in feelings of guilt that worsen their emotional state. It is vitally important, therefore, for family and friends to be supportive.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Learn more about the disorder: </strong>This suggestion may be especially appropriate for those who deal closely with sufferers of anxiety disorders. This may include an immediate family member or a particularly close friend.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Keep comforting one another: </strong>The first-century missionary Paul urged friends in the Greek city of Thessalonica to “keep comforting one another and building one another up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>) We can do this both by our words and our tone of voice. We need to show that we deeply care for our friends, and we need to avoid hurtful insinuations.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Consider the three professed friends of the man Job, after whom a book in the Bible is named. Those men, as you may remember, wrongly implied that Job was in some way covering over concealed sins and that his suffering was the result of his cover-up.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">So, be sensitive to a sufferer’s feelings. Listen carefully. Try to view matters through the eyes of the one who is suffering, rather than through your own. Do not jump to conclusions while listening. Job’s professed friends did, and as a result, they were called “troublesome comforters.” They actually made him feel worse!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:16:2-18:16:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 16:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Remember to listen carefully to sufferers. Allow them to express freely how they feel. This may help you to understand better what they are going through. And think of the reward! You may be able to help sufferers enjoy a more full and meaningful life.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sc"><strong>Identifying Types of Anxiety Disorders</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc">  Understanding anxiety disorders is vital, especially when the people involved are immediate family members or close friends. Consider five types of such disorders.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="se">  <strong>Panic Disorders </strong>Recall Isabella, mentioned in the introduction of our article. It is not only the attacks of anxiety that she finds disabling. “In between them, there is the dread that an attack is going to happen again,” she says. As a result, sufferers tend to avoid places where they have had an attack. Some become so restricted that they are housebound or are able to confront a feared situation only when accompanied by someone they trust. Isabella explained: “Merely being alone is enough to trigger an attack. Mother gives me security; I can’t stand it if she is not nearby.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="se">  <strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder </strong>A person obsessed with germs or dirt may develop a compulsion to wash his hands over and over again. Regarding a similar compulsion, Renan says: “My mind is in constant turmoil as I go over and over past mistakes, reanalyzing them and looking at them from every possible angle.” The result is an obsession to confess past mistakes to others. Renan is in constant need of reassurance. But medication has been of help in controlling his obsession.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se">  <strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders </strong>(PTSD) In recent times this term has been used to describe a range of psychological symptoms people may experience following an extremely traumatic event that involved physical harm or the threat of such. PTSD sufferers may startle easily, be irritable, become emotionally numb, lose interest in things they once enjoyed, and have trouble feeling affection for others<wbr />—especially those with whom they used to be close. Some become aggressive, even violent, and tend to avoid situations that remind them of the original traumatic incident.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="se">  <strong>Social Phobia, or Social Anxiety Disorder </strong>This is a term used to identify people who are overwhelmingly anxious and excessively self-conscious in everyday social situations. Some sufferers have an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. They may worry for days or weeks before attending an event. Their fear may become so severe that it interferes with work, school, or other ordinary activities and makes it hard for them to make and keep friends.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se">  <strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder </strong>Monica, mentioned earlier, suffers from this disorder. She goes through the day filled with “exaggerated worries,” even though there is little or nothing to provoke them. Sufferers tend to anticipate disaster and are overly concerned with health issues, money, family problems, or difficulties at work. Just the thought of getting through the day may produce anxiety.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

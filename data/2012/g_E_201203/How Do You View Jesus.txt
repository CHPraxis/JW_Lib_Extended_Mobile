How Do You View Jesus?
Are you more inclined to think of Jesus as a newborn baby, a dying man, or an exalted King?
The Bible reveals that Jesus is a powerful King. But what does this mean for you?
Many believe that Jesus died for them. Yet, how can one man’s death almost 2,000 years ago mean life for others today?
You are cordially invited to listen to Scriptural answers to these questions. This information will be presented when Jehovah’s Witnesses gather to commemorate Jesus’ death. This year the anniversary falls on Thursday, April 5, after sundown.
Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.

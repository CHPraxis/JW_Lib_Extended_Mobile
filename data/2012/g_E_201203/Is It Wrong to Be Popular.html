<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">THE correct answer is <strong>“B.” </strong>Why? Because to be popular simply means to be liked by a lot of people<wbr />—and that’s not always wrong! The Bible foretold that Christians would be “a light of the nations” and that people would be drawn to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:6-23:42:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:47-44:13:47" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 13:47</a>) In that sense, it can be said that Christians are popular.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Did you know?</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="9" class="p9 sb"> Jesus was popular. Even as a young person, he gained “favor with God and men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:52</a>) And the Bible says that when Jesus became an adult, “great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:25-40:4:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 4:25</a>.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Why was that proper?</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sb"> Because Jesus wasn’t <em>seeking </em>glory or <em>pursuing </em>popularity, and he wasn’t desperate for others’ approval. Jesus simply did what was right<wbr />—a stance that sometimes brought him favorable attention. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:29-43:8:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 8:29, 30</a>) At the same time, Jesus realized that any approval he won from the often-fickle public would be temporary. He acknowledged that in time people would put him to death!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:22-42:9:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 9:22</a>.</p>

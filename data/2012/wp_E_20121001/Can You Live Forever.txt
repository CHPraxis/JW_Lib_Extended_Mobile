Can You Live Forever?

This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.



1. Why does our life seem short?

Some tortoises live for 150 years, and some trees for 3,000 years. By contrast, the human life span is much shorter. Yet, our life can be a lot more meaningful than that of a tortoise or a tree. Jehovah God created humans with the capacity to enjoy music, sports, dining, learning, traveling, and meeting people. God put in our hearts the desire for life without end.—Read Ecclesiastes 3:11.



2. Can we really live forever?

Jehovah lives forever. He does not die. He is the Source of life, so he can give everlasting life to others. (Psalm 36:9; Habakkuk 1:12) Furthermore, he has promised to grant everlasting life to those who obey him. He will reverse the process of aging.—Read Job 33:24, 25; Isaiah 25:8; 33:24.
Jesus demonstrated by his powerful works that we can trust God’s promise of everlasting life in perfect health. Jesus cured many types of diseases and even resurrected people who had died.—Read Luke 7:11-15, 18, 19, 22.



3. When will everlasting life become a reality?

God wants us to live forever, not in a world filled with oppression and violence, but on a paradise earth. He wants us to feel secure. (Psalm 37:9, 29; Isaiah 65:21, 22) As the earth is restored to Paradise, millions who have died will return to life. Resurrected people who choose to worship God and obey him will live forever.—Read Luke 23:42, 43; John 5:28, 29.



4. How can we gain everlasting life?

We can receive endless life only from God. So, we do well to draw close to him by getting to know him. The Bible likens taking in knowledge of God to taking in food. (Matthew 4:4) Eating food is enjoyable, but obtaining and preparing our food requires effort. Similarly, taking in spiritual food requires effort. But what could be more worthwhile than drawing close to God and receiving everlasting life?—Read Luke 13:23, 24; John 6:27; 17:3.

We must often wait two or three months to receive payment for those services. Recently, though, I received a phone call from a government worker. He offered to speed up the payments<wbr />—if we gave him some of the money as a kickback.”<wbr />—JOHN.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">According to Transparency International’s (TI) 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index,<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> “the vast majority of the 183 countries and territories assessed score below five on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).” Two years earlier, TI acknowledged that its 2009 annual report exposed the pervasive reality of corruption: “It is clear that no region of the world is immune to the perils of corruption.”</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In some cases, the consequences of corruption can be disastrous. For example, <em>Time </em>magazine reported that “corruption and carelessness” were at least partially responsible for the very heavy death toll in the massive earthquake that <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>struck Haiti in 2010. It added further: “Buildings rise with little if any input from engineers and plenty of bribes to so-called government inspectors.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Is there a lasting solution to the scourge of corruption? To answer that question, we need to understand the basic causes of corruption. We will consider these in the next article.</p>

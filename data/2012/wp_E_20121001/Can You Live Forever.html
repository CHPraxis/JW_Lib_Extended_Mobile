<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some tortoises live for 150 years, and some trees for 3,000 years. By contrast, the human life span is much shorter. Yet, our life can be a lot more meaningful than that of a tortoise or a tree. Jehovah God created humans with the capacity to enjoy music, sports, dining, learning, traveling, and meeting people. God put in our hearts the desire for life without end.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Ecclesiastes 3:11</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">We can receive endless life only from God. So, we do well to draw close to him by getting to know him. The Bible likens taking in knowledge of God to taking in food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4</a>) Eating food is enjoyable, but obtaining and preparing our food requires effort. Similarly, taking in spiritual food requires effort. But what could be more worthwhile than drawing close to God and receiving everlasting life?<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:13:23-42:13:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Luke 13:23, 24;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:27-43:6:27" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <em>John 6:27;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> <em>17:3</em></a><em>.</em></p>

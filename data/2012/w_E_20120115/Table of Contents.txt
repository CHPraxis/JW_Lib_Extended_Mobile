PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 4-8
This article will show how sincere Christians throughout the ages have sought to be guided by God’s Word. The discussion highlights our yeartext for 2012.
STUDY ARTICLE 2  PAGES 9-13
This article discusses three lessons about keeping on the watch that we can learn from the apostles and other first-century Christians. This study should strengthen our determination to bear thorough witness about God’s Kingdom.
STUDY ARTICLES 3, 4  PAGES 16-25
The Mosaic Law required that the ancient Israelites make sacrifices to Jehovah on a number of occasions. Christians are not bound by that Law. However, principles therein provide lessons regarding the spirit of gratitude that Jehovah expects from his worshippers today, as these articles will explain.
STUDY ARTICLE 5  PAGES 26-30
The greatest need for mankind is to be reconciled to God. This article explores how a royal priesthood will help to accomplish this reconciliation, and it explains how we will benefit.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHICH methods of communication below have <em>you </em>used during the past month?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si">Face-to-face conversation</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">Handwritten letter or card</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">Phone call</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">E-mail</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Text message</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">Instant message</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">Video chat</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">Social network</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Never have there been so many options for keeping in touch, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. Consider a few examples:</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATION</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Advantage: </strong>Includes all the subtle nuances of facial expression, tone of voice, and gestures.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Disadvantage: </strong>Both parties must be available to talk.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>HANDWRITTEN LETTER OR CARD</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Advantage: </strong>Warm and personal.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Disadvantage: </strong>Takes time to write and days to reach the recipient.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>E-MAIL</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong>Advantage: </strong>Can be composed and delivered quickly.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Disadvantage: </strong>Emotion is often lacking<wbr />—or easy to misinterpret.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Enter social networking, which some say is the <em>best </em>way to keep in touch. Hundreds of social networks exist, and the most popular one<wbr />—Facebook—<wbr />has some 800 million members! “If Facebook were a country,” says <em>Time </em>magazine, “it would be the third largest, behind only China and India.” What are social networks, and why have they become so popular?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">A social network is a Web site that allows users to share information with a selected group of friends. “It’s a great way to stay connected,” says 21-year-old Jean. “Social networking is also a convenient way to share photos from trips or events.”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Why not just write a letter? ‘Too time-consuming,’ some would answer<wbr />—and it is expensive if you have to make copies of photos. Why not use the phone? Again, too <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>time-consuming<wbr />—especially since you have to call one person at a time, and some will not be at home or available to talk when <em>you </em>are. What about an e-mail? “No one answers e-mails anymore,” complains 20-year-old Danielle, “and even if they do, getting a reply can take <em>weeks. </em>On a social network, I just post a comment about what I’m doing, and my friends can post comments about their day. We’re all updated as soon as we log on. It’s easy!”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Not that social networking is all idle chit-chat. For example, when a disaster strikes<wbr />—such as the earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan on March 11, 2011—<wbr />many turn to social networks to find out about the welfare of their loved ones.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Consider the experience of Benjamin, who lives in the United States. “Phone lines were down after the tsunami in Japan,” he says. “An acquaintance told me that he had e-mailed a mutual friend of ours in Tokyo, but he hadn’t heard back from her. At that moment, I picked up my cell phone and, accessing the Internet, went to her social network page. Right then and there, I saw a brief message she had posted saying that she was OK and that she would provide further details later.”</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Benjamin continues: “As for contacting my friends who knew her and who <em>didn’t </em>have a social network page, I had to e-mail them individually. It took time to track down their addresses and to write to each one. I received several responses within a few days. One person took about two weeks to respond! Those people were getting so many e-mails from everyone that it was hard for them to keep up. So much time could have been saved by social networking. Within minutes, everyone could have been brought up-to-date!”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Clearly, social networking has some advantages. But are there any dangers? If so, what are they, and how can you avoid them?</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sc"><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sm"> 1. Post a message (status update) on your page.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sm"> 2. All of those on your list of friends receive your message when they log on to their page<wbr />—and you receive <em>their </em>messages when you log on to <em>your </em>page.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

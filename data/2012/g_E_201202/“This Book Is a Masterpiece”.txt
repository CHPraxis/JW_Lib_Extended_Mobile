After studying this book, an appreciative reader stated: “Written in such a simple manner, yet conveying in beautiful detail the life of our Lord while on earth, this book is a masterpiece.”
To the extent known, events in this book are related in the order in which they occurred. It is based on the divinely inspired writings of four of Jesus’ contemporaries, the Gospel writers Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Matthew and John were apostles and traveling companions of Jesus. Mark was a close friend of Peter, one of Jesus’ apostles. And the physician Luke was a traveling companion of the Christian apostle Paul.

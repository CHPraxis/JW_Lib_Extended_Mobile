</header>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Paper wasps have been described as masters of engineering. Why is this description fitting?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>As its name suggests, the paper wasp builds and maintains its compound nest out of a special kind of paper, which it manufactures itself.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The insect collects fibers of plants and of dead wood from all kinds of places<wbr />—logs, fence posts, telephone poles, and building materials. It then chews the cellulose-rich material, adding a sticky, high-protein saliva. When applied, the resulting paste dries to form a light, firm, yet tough, paper. Moreover, the saliva has special properties that enable the paper to generate and absorb heat, thus maintaining the right temperature in the brood comb on cool days.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The wasp builds its nest “mouthful by mouthful.” The finished product is a waterproof, paper-umbrella-covered cluster of hexagonal cells<wbr />—the hexagon combining strength and efficiency. Wasps that live in wetter areas simply add more oral secretion because of its water-resistant properties. That said, the insects select sites that offer some kind of protective overhang. From this they suspend their downward-facing nests by a stalk, or petiole. Moreover, paper wasps do no harm to the environment<wbr />—unlike our papermaking processes, which pollute air, water, and land!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Understandably, architects and researchers are studying the wasp’s products with a view to designing superior building materials that are lightweight, strong, more flexible, and biodegradable.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did an insect with a brain roughly the size of two grains of sand figure out papermaking and nest architecture by itself? Or are its chemical- and mechanical-engineering skills evidence of design?</p>

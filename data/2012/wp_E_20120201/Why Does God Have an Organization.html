<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sm"> <strong>1. Why did God organize the Israelites?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God organized descendants of the patriarch Abraham into a nation and gave them a body of laws. He called the nation Israel and made it the custodian of true worship and of his Word, the Holy Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:147:19-19:147:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 147:19, 20</a>) Thus, people of all nations have benefited.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Genesis 22:18</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God chose the Israelites to be his witnesses. When they were obedient, they benefited from God’s laws. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:4:6-5:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>) By studying the history of the Israelites, we can get to know more about the true God.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Isaiah 43:10,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:12-23:43:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <em>12</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sm"> <strong>2. Why are true Christians organized?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In time, Israel lost God’s favor, and Jehovah replaced that nation with the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 21:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:37-40:23:38" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23:37, 38</a>) Formerly, the Israelites were witnesses of God. Now, true Christians serve as Jehovah’s witnesses.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>Acts 15:14,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:17-44:15:17" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <em>17</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus organized his followers to witness about Jehovah and to make disciples in all nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 10:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) This work is reaching its climax. For the first time, Jehovah has united millions from all nations in true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10</a>) True Christians are also organized so that they can encourage and help one another. Worldwide, they enjoy the same program of Bible instruction at their meetings.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><em>Hebrews 10:24, 25</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sm"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span> <strong>3. In modern times, how did Jehovah’s Witnesses begin?</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The modern-day organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses began in the 1870’s. A small group of Bible students began rediscovering long-lost Bible truths. They knew that Jesus organized the Christian congregation to preach. So they undertook an international Kingdom-preaching campaign. In 1931 they adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><em>Acts 1:8;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:1-44:2:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> <em>2:1,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:4-44:2:4" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> <em>4;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> <em>5:42</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sm"> <strong>4. How are Jehovah’s Witnesses organized today?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In the first century, the Christian congregations in many lands benefited from a central governing body that recognized Jesus as the Head of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:16:4-44:16:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 16:4, 5</a>) Similarly today, Jehovah’s Witnesses recognize Jesus as their Leader. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:9-40:23:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 23:9, 10</a>) They also benefit from the guidance of a Governing Body of experienced elders who provide Scriptural encouragement and direction for the more than 100,000 congregations. In each congregation, qualified men serve as elders, or overseers. These men lovingly care for God’s flock.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><em>1 Peter 5:2, 3</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are organized to preach the good news and to make disciples. In order to help people everywhere, they translate, print, and distribute Bible study material in over 500 languages. Like the apostles, they preach from house to house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>) They offer to study the Bible personally with sincere lovers of truth. Since Jehovah’s people focus on pleasing God and helping others, they are an organization of happy people.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:33:12-19:33:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 33:12;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> <em>Acts 20:35</em></a><em>.</em></p>

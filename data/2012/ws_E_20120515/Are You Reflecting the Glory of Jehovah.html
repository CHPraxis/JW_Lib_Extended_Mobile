<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?</strong></p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>Why is it possible for humans to imitate Jehovah’s qualities?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">IN ONE way or another, all of us are like our parents. We probably have heard someone say to a boy, ‘You are just like your father’ or to a girl, ‘You remind me of your mother.’ And children often try to imitate what their parents do. But what about us? Can we imitate our heavenly Father, Jehovah? Although we have not seen him, we can learn about his wonderful qualities by what we see in the things he created. We can also learn about God’s qualities by studying the Bible and meditating on what we read, especially on what his Son, Jesus, said and did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 1:20</a>) So it is possible for us to imitate Jehovah’s qualities, and in that way we can reflect his glory.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Before God created humans, he knew that they would be able to do his will, imitate his qualities, and glorify him. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 1:26, 27</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As Christians, we want to imitate the qualities of our God. If we do so, we have the great honor to reflect his glory. We can reflect God’s glory no matter what our culture or race is or how much education we have. Why? Because “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>How do we feel as we serve Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Anointed Christians reflect Jehovah’s glory. The apostle Paul, who was one of them, wrote: “All of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:3:18-47:3:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>) Paul was speaking of the time when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. Moses’ face was shining with rays of light because Jehovah had spoken with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:29-2:34:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>) We have not had the same experience as Moses had, and when people look at our faces, they do not see rays of light. But they can see the joy we feel when we speak about Jehovah, his qualities, and his wonderful purpose for mankind. So whether we are of the anointed or of the other sheep, we are like polished metal mirrors of ancient times in the sense that we reflect Jehovah’s glory in our life and ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:1-47:4:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>) Are you reflecting Jehovah’s glory by living in a way that pleases him and by regularly participating in the preaching work?</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>(a) Like Paul, what fight do we have inside of us? (b) How does sin affect humans?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>As Jehovah’s servants, we want to reflect his glory in everything we do. But we often do what is wrong even though we wish to do what is right. Paul also had this problem. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 7:21-25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He clearly explained why we have to fight against our wrong desires: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>) Because Adam sinned, all humans are born as slaves to sin, which is like a cruel king who rules over them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What is sin? It is anything that is the opposite of Jehovah’s qualities, of what he likes, and of what he wants from us. Sin damages a person’s relationship with God. Sin prevents us from reflecting God’s glory, just as something can prevent an archer from hitting his target. Sometimes we sin because we choose to. Other times we sin by mistake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:15:27-4:15:31" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Numbers 15:27-31</a>) Sin has a very strong influence on us, and it separates us from our Creator. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 51:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Isaiah 59:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:21-51:1:21" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Colossians 1:21</a>) Most humans live in a way that completely separates them from God, so they miss the wonderful opportunity to reflect God’s glory. Nothing has a worse effect on humans than sin.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why is it possible for us to reflect Jehovah’s glory even though we are sinful?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Although we are born with sin, Jehovah has given us a hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 15:13</a>) When he gave Jesus as a ransom sacrifice, Jehovah made it possible for us to be set free from sin. Because of our faith in that sacrifice, we are no longer “slaves to sin,” and we can reflect Jehovah’s glory and be his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:6-45:6:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) If we continue to be God’s friends, we can be sure that he will bless us now. And in the future, he will make us perfect and give us everlasting life. It is a great honor that God thinks we can reflect his glory even though we are still sinful.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>WHAT HELPS US TO REFLECT GOD’S GLORY?</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What do we need to admit if we want to reflect God’s glory?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As sinful humans, we all have weaknesses. If we want to reflect God’s glory, each one of us needs to know what our own weaknesses are. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:6:36-14:6:36" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 6:36</a>) We need to admit that we have those weaknesses and then fight against them so that we can glorify God. For example, if we are sinning by viewing pornography, we must admit that we need help from the elders and then ask them to help us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">James 5:14, 15</a>) This is the first thing we should do if we really want to glorify God. We must always make sure that we are living in the way that Jehovah requires of us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:18-20:28:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 10:12</a>) No matter what our weaknesses are, we must keep fighting against them so that we can reflect God’s glory.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus was the only human who always did what was pleasing to God and perfectly reflected God’s glory. Although we are not perfect like Jesus, we should try hard to imitate his example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>) Jehovah notices not only our progress but also our efforts to glorify him, and he blesses these efforts.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The Bible can help us to understand how we can better reflect God’s glory.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>) When we read the Bible daily, we learn what changes we need to make so that we can become better Christians. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:22-25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>What we learn from the Bible strengthens our faith.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How can prayer help us to do better in Jehovah’s service?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>If we want to reflect God’s glory, we also need to “persevere in prayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 12:12</a>) We should pray for Jehovah’s help to serve him in a way that he accepts. We can ask him for holy spirit, for more faith, and for strength to resist temptation. We can also ask him to help us become good teachers <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>of the Bible.

If we ask Jehovah to help us do better in his service, we can be sure that he will help us. We must never feel that our prayers might annoy Jehovah. So let us use our prayers to praise him, to thank him, and to ask him to guide us especially when we are in difficult situations. We can also ask Jehovah to help us glorify him with our service.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:12-19:86:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 86:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:7" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> James 1:5-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>God has given “the faithful and discreet slave” the responsibility of caring for his precious sheep.

One way that we can learn to do this is by attending our meetings. Our meetings help us to make adjustments in our life and to improve our Christian qualities, just as a tailor would adjust our clothes and improve our appearance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) That is why we should arrive at meetings on time.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>We can reflect Jehovah’s glory only if we “become imitators of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>) One way to imitate Jehovah is to learn to think as he does. When we try to do things our own way and not according to God’s thinking, we dishonor him and cause trouble for ourselves. Since we live in Satan’s world, we must work hard to hate what Jehovah hates and to love what Jehovah loves.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We should hate sin because Jehovah hates it. If we hate sin, we will stay as far away as possible from anything that could make us sin. For example, we must stay away from apostasy. Those who become apostates no longer glorify God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:13:6-5:13:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 13:6-9</a>) So we should completely avoid apostates or anyone who says that he is a brother but who is dishonoring God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) Because we are imperfect, sometimes it may be hard to show love. But we must try to be loving at all times.

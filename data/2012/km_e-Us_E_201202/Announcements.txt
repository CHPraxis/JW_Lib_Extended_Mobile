▪ Literature offer for February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?, or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ The special talk will be given on the weekend after the Memorial and is entitled “Is It Later Than You Think?”
▪ Whenever personal travel plans include visiting a land that is not listed separately in the current service year report or whose address is not listed on the last page of the latest Yearbook, please contact your branch office to ascertain what precautions or special instructions may need to be followed. The Kingdom work in that area may be under certain restrictions. (Matt. 10:16) In some lands it may not be advisable for visitors to make contact with local Witnesses or congregations. Other direction may be provided to you regarding informal witnessing or carrying supplies of literature. Your cooperation with the direction provided will prevent unnecessary problems for you or for the Kingdom work in the country you visit.—1 Cor. 14:33, 40.

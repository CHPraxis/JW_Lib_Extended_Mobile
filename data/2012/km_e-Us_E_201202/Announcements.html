<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Bible<wbr />—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The special talk will be given on the weekend after the Memorial and is entitled “Is It Later Than You Think?”</p>

Would You Benefit From the Simplified Edition?
The study edition of The Watchtower is now available in a simplified English edition. This edition is provided for (1) English-speaking publishers who would benefit from simplified wording, perhaps because of limited education; (2) publishers whose first language is not English; (3) young people, including those in elementary and middle school; and (4) Bible students who need simpler, more direct language to understand spiritual matters.
The paragraph numbers, questions, and headings correspond to the standard edition. The material is exactly the same, but the wording is simpler. Although the Watchtower Study conductor and reader will use the standard edition unless most in the audience are using the simplified edition, those using the simplified edition will see the same cited scriptures and the same illustrations and will be able to follow the reading of the paragraphs and to share in commenting.
Any who feel they would benefit should place a standing request with the magazine servant.

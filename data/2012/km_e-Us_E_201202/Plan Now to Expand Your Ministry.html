<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How did you and others respond to the provision of a reduced hour requirement for auxiliary pioneers last April?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Auxiliary Pioneering: </strong>Last year congregations were abuzz with excitement when they learned of the provision to auxiliary pioneer in April with a reduced hour requirement. One brother wrote: “I am still in high school, and I have not found it possible for me to regular pioneer. But I am going to apply for 30 hours and strive for 50 hours in the month of April.” A sister who works full-time wrote: “Thirty hours<wbr />—that is so very achievable!” When this provision was announced, one former pioneer, now in her 80’s, said: “This is the moment I’ve been waiting for! Jehovah knew pioneering was the best time of my life!” Others who could not auxiliary pioneer set goals to do more in the ministry.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>March will be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer because we will again have the option of a 30- or a 50-hour requirement. In addition, beginning Saturday, March 17, we will participate in a special campaign to invite others to join us for the Memorial on April 5. Many will enjoy their enlarged share in the ministry so much that they will want to auxiliary pioneer in April and May too, with a 50-hour requirement.</p>

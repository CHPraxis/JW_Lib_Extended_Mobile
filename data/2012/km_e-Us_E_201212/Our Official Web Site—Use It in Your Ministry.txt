Our Official Web Site—Use It in Your Ministry
Direct People to the Web Site: Some who hesitate to converse with us or accept literature are willing to investigate Jehovah’s Witnesses by looking at jw.org in the privacy of their home. So publicize the Web site at every appropriate opportunity.
Answer Questions: At times a householder, an interested person, or an acquaintance will ask a question about Jehovah’s Witnesses or our beliefs. Show him the answer on the spot, using a mobile device or a computer. It is often best to read the cited scriptures directly from the Bible. If you do not have ready access to the Internet, explain how the person can use jw.org to find the answer himself.—Go to “Bible Teachings/Bible Questions Answered” or “About Us/Frequently Asked Questions.”
Send an Article or a Publication to Someone You Know: Attach a downloaded PDF or an EPUB to an e-mail. Or download an audio version of a publication onto a CD. Each time you give someone who is not baptized a complete electronic book, brochure, or magazine, you may count it as a placement. Material should not be sent anonymously or in bulk. Neither should it be uploaded to any other Internet Web site.—Go to “Publications.”
Show the Latest News About Jehovah’s Witnesses: This will help Bible students and others you are calling on to develop appreciation for the worldwide scope of our work and our Christian unity. (Ps. 133:1)—Go to “News.”

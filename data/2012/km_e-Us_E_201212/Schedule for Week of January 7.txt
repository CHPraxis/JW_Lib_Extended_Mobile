10 min: Ideas for Offering the Magazines in January. Discussion. Take 30 to 60 seconds to relate why the magazines will have appeal in your territory. Then, using the cover subject of The Watchtower, invite the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask and then invite suggestions on a scripture to read. Do the same for Awake! and, if time allows, for one other article from either magazine. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered.
10 min: Local needs.
10 min: A Clean Kingdom Hall Honors Jehovah. Talk by an elder. Jehovah is a holy God, so physical cleanness should be a priority among his people. (Ex. 30:17-21; 40:30-32) By keeping our place of worship clean and in good repair, we bring Jehovah glory. (1 Pet. 2:12) Relate local or published experiences showing how the appearance of a Kingdom Hall resulted in a witness to the community. Interview the brother who coordinates cleaning and maintenance regarding local arrangements. Encourage all to share in the upkeep of the Kingdom Hall.

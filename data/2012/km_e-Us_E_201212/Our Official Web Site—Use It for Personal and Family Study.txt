Our Official Web Site—Use It for Personal and Family Study
Read the Latest Magazine Online: Read The Watchtower and Awake! online several weeks before receiving the printed copies in the congregation. Listen to audio recordings of a magazine.—Go to “Publications/Magazines.”
Read Material That Appears Only on the Web Site: Some material, such as “For Young People,” “My Bible Lessons,” “For Family Review,” and “Young People Ask,” now appears only on our Web site. Go online and consider some of this material during your personal and family study.—Go to “Bible Teachings/Children” or “Bible Teachings/Teenagers.”
Get the Latest News: Read encouraging reports and experiences, and watch video clips that highlight the progress of our work around the world. Reports on disasters and persecution can help us to be specific in our prayers for the affected brothers. (Jas. 5:16)—Go to “News.”
Do Research Using Online Library: If this feature is available in your language, use a computer or a mobile device to read the daily text online or to do research in some of our recent publications.—Go to “Publications/Online Library,” or type www.wol.jw.org in the address field of your browser.

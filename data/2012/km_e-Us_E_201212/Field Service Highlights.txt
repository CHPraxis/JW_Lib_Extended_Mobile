Field Service Highlights
We are pleased to report a new all-time peak in the Bahamas during the month of July! The total of 191 regular pioneers was an increase of 14 over the previous peak set in March 2012. In addition, when comparing the first 11 months of this service year with the same period last year, Bermuda had an increase of 6.3 percent in Bible studies, the Turks and Caicos Islands had an increase of 7.6 percent in publishers, and the United States had an increase of 4.5 percent in regular pioneers. Truly, Jehovah’s people are following the admonition to “let your light shine.”—Matt. 5:16.

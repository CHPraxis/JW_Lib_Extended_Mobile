<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On the first Saturday of each month, we have been using articles from the <em>Watchtower </em>series “Learn From God’s Word” to start Bible studies. Starting in January, this series is being replaced by “Bible Questions Answered,” which will appear on the back page of the public edition. We can use “Bible Questions Answered” in the ministry in much the same way that we used “Learn From God’s Word.” (<a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:202010443/1-17$p/E:202010444/1-5"><em>km </em>12/10 p. 2</a>) As in the past, <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will contain a sample presentation that we can use on the first Saturday of the month.</p>

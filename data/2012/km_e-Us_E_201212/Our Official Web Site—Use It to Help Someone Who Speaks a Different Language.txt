Our Official Web Site—Use It to Help Someone Who Speaks a Different Language
Show Him Our Web Site: Demonstrate how he can use the “Site Language” list to see the Web site in his language. (In some languages, only a portion of the site is available.)
Show Him a Web Page in His Language: Display a page from one of our publications, such as the Bible Teach book or the Know the Truth tract. Choose the householder’s language from the “Read In” list.
Let Him Listen to an Article: Find an article for which there is an audio track in the person’s language, and play it for him. If you are learning another language, improve your skill by listening to an audio track in that language as you read.—Go to “Publications/Books and Brochures” or “Publications/Magazines.”
Witness to the Deaf: If you find a deaf person, play a sign-language video of a chapter from the Bible, a book, a brochure, or a tract.—Go to “Publications/Sign Language.”

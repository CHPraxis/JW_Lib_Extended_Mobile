<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We customarily have a monthly Service Meeting part about offering the magazines. Its purpose is not to review the contents of the magazines. Rather, this part is designed to <em>discuss ideas </em>for offering the magazines. Therefore, according to the instructions, the assigned brother gives a <em>very brief </em>introduction to stimulate enthusiasm for the magazines. Then, he obtains publishers’ suggestions on one article (or series) at a time so that all can follow along and take note of ideas they want to use. Rather than inviting the audience to give an entire presentation, he requests several comments on an interest-arousing question to ask and then asks for some comments on a scripture to read. He concludes by having demonstrations for each magazine. We are encouraged to review the magazines in advance and to be ready to give our suggestions. If all prepare well, this part will help us to sharpen the face of one another.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 27:17</a>.</p>

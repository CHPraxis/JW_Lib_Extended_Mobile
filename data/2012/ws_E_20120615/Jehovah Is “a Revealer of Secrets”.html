<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">JUST before God’s Kingdom destroys all human governments, which ones will be the most powerful? We know the answer because Jehovah God is the “Revealer of secrets,” and he has revealed it to us through the writings of the prophet Daniel and the apostle John.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah gave Daniel and John several visions of wild beasts. He also explained to Daniel the meaning of a prophetic dream about a giant metal image. Jehovah made sure that Daniel and John wrote about these visions so that we can read about them in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) Jehovah wanted to strengthen our hope that soon God’s Kingdom will destroy all human governments.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>

But we can understand those prophecies only if we understand the first prophecy in the Bible. Why? Because the whole Bible and all the prophecies in it are connected to the first prophecy.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Who are the two parts of the seed of the woman? What will that seed do?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Soon after the rebellion in Eden, Jehovah prophesied that a “woman” would have a “seed,” <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>or offspring.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>That seed would “bruise” the serpent, Satan, in the head. Jehovah later revealed that the seed would come from Abraham, from the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Judah, and from the family of King David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 22:15-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 49:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:89:3-19:89:4" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Psalm 89:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Luke 1:30-33</a>) Christ Jesus is the main part of the seed.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:26-48:3:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Galatians 3:26-29</a>) Together, Jesus and these anointed ones form God’s Kingdom.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>(a) How many powerful governments do the visions of Daniel and John mention? (b) What do the heads of the wild beast of Revelation mean?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In that first prophecy Jehovah gave in Eden, he also said that Satan would have a “seed.” Satan’s seed would have enmity, or hatred, for the seed of the woman. Who are the seed of the serpent? All those who hate God and fight his people, as Satan does. Besides religious and military organizations, Satan has organized his seed into many governments, or kingdoms. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:5-42:4:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 4:5, 6</a>) Only some of these governments have fought directly against God’s people, that is, against the nation of Israel or the congregation of anointed Christians. This helps us to understand why the visions of Daniel and John mention only eight great powers even though there were others.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Almost two thousand years ago, Jesus gave the apostle John some amazing visions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 1:1</a>) In one of them, John saw a dragon standing on the shore of the sea. This <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>dragon means the Devil. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 13:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>John also saw a strange wild beast come out of the sea. It had seven heads and received great authority from the Devil. Later, John saw a scarlet beast that also had seven heads. This was an image of the wild beast of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:13:1-66:13:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1</a>. An angel told John that the seven heads of the scarlet beast mean “seven kings,” or governments.

We will also learn more about many of these governments from the book of Daniel. Daniel’s prophecies gave details about some of these governments hundreds of years before they even existed.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FIRST TWO HEADS MEAN EGYPT AND ASSYRIA</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What does the first head mean? Why?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The first head of the beast means Egypt because Egypt was the first world power to hate and fight God’s people. God had promised Abraham that the seed of the woman would come from his family. The Israelites were descendants of Abraham. After they went to live in Egypt and became many, Egypt started to treat them harshly. Satan tried to destroy God’s people because he did not want the seed to arrive. So he used Pharaoh to try to kill all newborn Israelite boys. But Jehovah did not allow that to happen to his people, and he freed them from Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:15-2:1:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 1:15-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:14:13-2:14:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14:13</a>) Later, he gave the Israelites the Promised Land.</p>

This powerful government also tried to destroy God’s people. Jehovah had used Assyria to punish ten of the tribes of Israel because those Israelites worshipped idols and disobeyed God. But then the Assyrians tried to destroy Jerusalem. Perhaps Satan wanted to destroy the family of kings in Jerusalem because Jesus was to come from that family. Jehovah did not want Jerusalem to be destroyed, so he destroyed the Assyrian army and saved his people.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:19:32-12:19:35" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Kings 19:32-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:10:5-23:10:6" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Isaiah 10:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:10:12-23:10:15" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 12-15</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The third head of the beast that John saw means the kingdom of Babylon. Jehovah allowed the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem and to take his people as prisoners. Before this happened, Jehovah told his disobedient people what the kingdom of Babylon would do to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:20:16-12:20:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:16-18</a>) Jehovah also told the Israelites that he would no longer allow their kings to sit on his “throne” in Jerusalem.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Another prophecy showed that the Jews would be worshipping at the temple in Jerusalem when the promised Messiah arrived. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>) And before the Israelites became prisoners in Babylon, another prophecy said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a>) These prophecies could not be fulfilled unless the Jews left Babylon, returned to their land, and rebuilt the temple. But the Babylonians did not normally release their prisoners. How could God’s people go back to their land?

Jehovah used different symbols to prophesy what would happen. For example, he gave King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon a dream about a giant image that was made of different metals. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:1-27:2:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 2:1,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:19-27:2:19" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> <strong>19,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:31-27:2:38" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> <strong>31-38</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah used Daniel to reveal that the gold head of the image meant the kingdom of Babylon.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.)

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>More than a hundred years before Daniel’s time, Jehovah’s prophet <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>Isaiah gave important information about the world power that would conquer Babylon. Jehovah explained how the army of that world power would go into the city of Babylon, and he even gave the name of their leader. That leader was Cyrus the Persian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:44:28-23:45:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:28–45:2</a>) Jehovah gave <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:1-27:2:49" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Daniel two</a> other visions about the world power of Medo-Persia. In one vision, Daniel saw a bear that was raised up on one side and that was going to “eat much flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:5-27:7:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Daniel 7:5</a>) In the other vision, Daniel saw a ram with two horns.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:8:3-27:8:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Daniel 8:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:8:20-27:8:20" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p>

In the Bible book of Esther, we read that Haman, a very important official of Persia, wanted to kill all the Jews who lived in this large kingdom. Haman instructed the people throughout the kingdom to kill all the Jews on a day that he had chosen. However, Jehovah again protected his people from the hatred of Satan’s seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:1:1-17:1:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Esther 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:3:8-17:3:9" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 3:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:8:3-17:8:3" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 8:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:8:9-17:8:14" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 9-14</a>) So we can say that Medo-Persia was the fourth head of the beast of Revelation.</p>

It quickly killed the ram with two horns that meant Medo-Persia. Jehovah told Daniel that the goat meant Greece and that the large horn meant one of its kings. Daniel also wrote that the large horn would be broken and four smaller horns would grow in its place. All details of this prophecy came true even though it was written hundreds of years before Greece became a world power. Alexander the Great was the large horn. He was the greatest king of ancient Greece, and he led the Greek army against Medo-Persia. This horn was broken when Alexander suddenly died. He was only 32 years old and was very powerful.

Eight Kings Revealed
The prophecies in the book of Daniel and in the book of Revelation reveal information about eight kings, or human rulerships, and the order in which they appear. We can understand those prophecies if we understand the first prophecy in the Bible.
Throughout history, Satan has organized his seed into many governments, or kingdoms. (Luke 4:5, 6) Some of these governments have fought directly against God’s people, that is, against the nation of Israel or the congregation of anointed Christians. The visions of Daniel and John describe only eight powerful governments that have fought against God’s people.

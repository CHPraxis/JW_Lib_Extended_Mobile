Miracles That Are About to Happen
IF A surgeon was scheduled to perform a complicated procedure on you, how would you feel if you found out that he had never performed this type of surgery? No doubt you would be concerned. But what if, on the other hand, you found out that this doctor was the leading surgeon in his field and that he had performed hundreds of successful operations like the one you were about to have? Would you not have much more confidence that he could help you?
The sick world in which we find ourselves today needs drastic “surgery.” Through his Word, the Bible, Jehovah God has promised that he will restore Paradise to this earth. (2 Peter 3:13) But for that to happen, wickedness will first have to be removed, completely cut away. (Psalm 37:9-11; Proverbs 2:21, 22) All the woeful conditions that we see around us must be eradicated before a paradise can be reestablished. It will literally take a miracle for that to happen!—Revelation 21:4, 5.
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that those massive changes will soon occur. Why? Because the miracles Jehovah God has already performed prove that he has the power to fulfill his promises. Compare just six of the miracles recorded in the Bible with the promises it makes for the future.
May you continue to learn about the Bible’s promises for our future. As your faith grows, so will your hope—a hope to live at a time when you will personally benefit from the miracles that Jehovah performs.

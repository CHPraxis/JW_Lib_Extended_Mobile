Where interest is shown, present the tract <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held on Thursday, April 5, 2012. If your congregation normally has meetings on Thursday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The two <em>Young People Ask </em>videos, <em>How Can I Make Real Friends? </em>and <em>What Will I Do With My Life?, </em>will be considered during upcoming Service Meetings. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.</p>

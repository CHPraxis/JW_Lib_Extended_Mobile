<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Last year the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work, </em>Volume I, was released. On <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1102011151/12:357-15:112">page 180</a>, it explains <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:16-20:24:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:16</a>, which says that a righteous one may fall seven times and get up. This was a great help to a young person who said: “The illustration on that page showed me that my progress is noticed by God. . . . This book made me realize that I can make my prayers more specific and ask God to help me with my feelings of worthlessness. In turn, I will be able to pray to him before giving in to temptation and thereby conquer my bad habit.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have confidence that even though I have fallen more than 77 times over the years, I will overcome my problem. I no longer feel that I’m the worst sinner to walk the planet.”</p>

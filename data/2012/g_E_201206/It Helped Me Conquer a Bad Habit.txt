It Helped Me Conquer a Bad Habit
● Last year the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work, Volume I, was released. On page 180, it explains Proverbs 24:16, which says that a righteous one may fall seven times and get up. This was a great help to a young person who said: “The illustration on that page showed me that my progress is noticed by God. . . . This book made me realize that I can make my prayers more specific and ask God to help me with my feelings of worthlessness. In turn, I will be able to pray to him before giving in to temptation and thereby conquer my bad habit.
“I have confidence that even though I have fallen more than 77 times over the years, I will overcome my problem. I no longer feel that I’m the worst sinner to walk the planet.”

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">THE above headlines appeared during a two-week period last year. Researchers estimate that each year about 30 percent of people in developed countries suffer from foodborne illness.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How do such reports affect you? “I get worried and even angry,” admits Hoi, a father in Hong Kong. “I have two children, and I am concerned about how and where their food is made.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In poorer countries, foodborne and waterborne diseases kill millions<wbr />—mostly children—<wbr />every year. “In the markets here, food items are exposed to flies, rain, wind, and dust,” says Bola, who lives in Nigeria. “When I read or hear about food diseases, I feel scared. I want to protect my family.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Is it possible to protect your family from unsafe food?

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc">  Some groups of people are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness, including:</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">● Children under the age of five</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">● Pregnant women</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">● People over the age of 70</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">● People with compromised immune systems</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se">  If you or anyone eating with you falls into one of these categories, you should be particularly cautious about the food you prepare, serve, and eat.</p>

PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 3-14
Wrong teachings have caused millions of people to fall asleep spiritually. We learn from these two articles how to wake them up from spiritual sleep and why it is urgent that we do so. Also, how can we keep a sense of urgency, and what does preaching with urgency mean?

STUDY ARTICLE 4  PAGES 21-26
Jesus warned: “Remember the wife of Lot.” (Luke 17:32) Why did Jesus say that? This article will help us to see three ways we can follow that warning. As you study the article, think about whether you need to make any changes in your life.

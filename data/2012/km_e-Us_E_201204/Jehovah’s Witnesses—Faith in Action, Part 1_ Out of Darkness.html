<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the Bible, light is associated with truth, whereas darkness is associated with falsehood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 43:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:5:20-23:5:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 5:20</a>) Satan introduced darkness into the world when he deceived Eve, and eventually he plunged mankind into deep darkness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) The video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—Faith in Action, Part 1: Out of Darkness </em>chronicles how spiritual light began to emerge from darkness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:1-23:60:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 60:1, 2</a>) After viewing the video, can you answer these questions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>(1) </strong>How did deep darkness develop after the death of the apostles? <strong>(2) </strong>Beginning in the 1100’s, what developments helped people to discern that the church had gone off course? <strong>(3) </strong>Who were Henry Grew and George Storrs? <strong>(4) </strong>What events in the life of Charles Russell had a profound effect on him? <strong>(5) </strong>How did Brother Russell, his father, and a few acquaintances carry out their Bible study class, and what Scriptural conclusions did they come to? <strong>(6) </strong>How did this Bible study group come to merge with Nelson Barbour’s group, but what caused Brother Russell to withdraw? <strong>(7) </strong>What occurred in July 1879 that began a new era of spiritual light? <strong>(8) </strong>Thereafter, what did the growing number of Bible Students do to spread the good news? <strong>(9) </strong>Years in advance, what did the Bible Students expect to occur in 1914? <strong>(10) </strong>What challenges did the Bible Students face after Brother Russell died? <strong>(11) </strong>What did the Bible Students do after Brother Rutherford and his associates were released from prison? <strong>(12) </strong>How has viewing this video deepened your appreciation for Jehovah’s organization? <strong>(13) </strong>How has this video strengthened your determination to continue zealously preaching despite obstacles? <strong>(14) </strong>How could we use this video to help our relatives, Bible students, and others?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What a precious spiritual heritage those early Bible Students left for us! In a spiritually darkened world, they were courageous and zealous light bearers. May we imitate their example and “go on walking as children of light.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:8-49:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 5:8</a>.</p>

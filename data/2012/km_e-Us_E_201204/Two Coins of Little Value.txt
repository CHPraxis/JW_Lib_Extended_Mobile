Two Coins of Little Value
One important way that we support Kingdom interests is by contributing financially to the worldwide preaching work. What if we are of limited means?
On one occasion Jesus saw a poor widow contribute to the temple treasury two coins of little monetary value. Love for Jehovah moved her to give “out of her want, . . . all of what she had, her whole living.” (Mark 12:41-44) Jesus took note, indicating that her contribution had great value in God’s eyes. Similarly, first-century Christians did not view the responsibility of providing financial support for the ministry to be the privilege of only wealthy Christians. The apostle Paul cited the example of the Macedonians who, despite “deep poverty . . . kept begging . . . with much entreaty for the privilege of kindly giving.”—2 Cor. 8:1-4.
Therefore, if we can only contribute ‘two coins of little value,’ we should remember that many small contributions can add up to a large amount. Our giving from the heart will please our generous heavenly Father, for “God loves a cheerful giver.”—2 Cor. 9:7.

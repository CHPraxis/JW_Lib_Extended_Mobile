<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are happy to report a new peak of 176 regular pioneers in the Bahamas during November 2011, an increase of 6 over the previous peak in September 2011. Also, when compared to the same month last year, the following increases in hours were reported: 5.8 percent in the Bahamas, 15.9 percent in Bermuda, 2.6 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and 2.8 percent in the United States. These consistent increases reflect our heart’s desire to remain ‘steadfast and unmovable’ in the Lord’s work.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>.</p>

She “Could Not Put It Down”




● A woman from New York, U.S.A., was captivated by the discussion of major religions of the world in the book Mankind’s Search for God. She explained: “I started to read it and could not put it down! Thank you for providing such well-balanced, informative literature.”
Another reader wrote: “I read the book from the front to the back cover. I also checked most of the references, and there are many! I confidently recommend the book to anyone. Of course, there is also something about the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but that is only a minute part of this brilliant history of religion.”

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"> Car accidents kill more than one million people and injure approximately 50 million each year. Yet, millions of fish can swim together in a school with virtually no collisions. How do fish do it, and what can they teach us about how to reduce car crashes?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>Schooling fish learn about their surroundings through their eyes and a special sense organ called the lateral line. They use these senses to perceive the location of other fish around them, and they then react as follows:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">              <em>Traveling side by side. </em>They match the speed of the fish beside them and maintain their distance from them.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">              <em>Approaching. </em>They draw nearer to fish that are farther away.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">               <em>Collision avoidance. </em>They change direction to avoid contact with other fish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Based on those three behaviors of schooling fish, a Japanese car manufacturer designed several tiny robot cars that can travel in a group without colliding. Instead of eyes, the robots use communication technologies; instead of a lateral line, they use a laser range finder. The company believes that this technology will help them to create “collision-free” cars and “contribute to an environmentally friendly and traffic-jam-free driving environment.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“We recreated the behavior of a school of fish [by] making full use of cutting-edge electronic technologies,” says Toshiyuki Andou, the principal engineer of the robot-car project. “We, in a motorized world, have a lot to learn from the behavior of a school of fish.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did fish schooling come about as the result of a mindless process? Or was it designed?</p>

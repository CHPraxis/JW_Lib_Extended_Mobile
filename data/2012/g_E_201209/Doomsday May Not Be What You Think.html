<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">APART from being utterly pessimistic, the foregoing doomsday scenarios have three things in common. First, they are based on the speculation of men, and humans have a far-from-perfect record when it comes to guessing the future. Second, human survival, if possible, would be a matter of chance. Third, survivors of a post-doomsday world would have a real struggle to stay alive.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In contrast, the Bible’s version of what the future holds paints a more reasonable picture. According to the Bible, for a certainty, a great change is coming. But survival is guaranteed to all who do God’s will. Furthermore, the Bible does not foretell that the earth will be blasted to a cinder or frozen like an ice cube. It will be transformed into a global paradise.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many people, though, have a problem accepting such Bible predictions. Skeptics view as fantasy the Bible’s teachings about a great tribulation, Armageddon, a millennium, and Paradise. These concepts have been endlessly discussed, debated, and interpreted by theologians. Their theories compete and clash with one another. Concerning the time of the end, author Bruce A. Robinson states: “Probably more obscure theological text has been written on this topic than on any other belief in Christendom.” The result? Confusion.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yet, the Scriptures are not obscure. The Bible is God’s message, and he does not want us to be puzzled about what lies ahead. Consider some frequently asked questions, followed by what the Bible itself says.

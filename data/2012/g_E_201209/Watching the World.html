<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">More and more patients from various parts of the world are traveling abroad to receive quality medical care, often at a fraction of the price they would have to pay at home. <em>Business World </em>reports that one million “medical tourists” are expected per year in the Philippines by 2015, and the same number are expected in South Korea by 2020. India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are also popular destinations. Demand is not limited to Westerners seeking help in such areas as orthopedics and cardiology. Many newly affluent Chinese are also visiting plastic surgeons with pictures of “celebrities they want to look like,” says the report.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Technology often obliges employees to work on two or more complex tasks simultaneously and answer queries immediately. Yet, “workers who are doing multiple things at one time are doing them poorly,” says Clifford Nass, director of the Communication Between Humans and Interactive Media Laboratory, at Stanford University, U.S.A. Reportedly, multitaskers are often stressed, are more easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli, do not think deeply and, as a result, miss important details. Nass suggests: “When you start to do something, do it and nothing else for 20 minutes. This trains you to focus, to think deeply.”</p>

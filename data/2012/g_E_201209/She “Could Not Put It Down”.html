Thank you for providing such well-balanced, informative literature.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another reader wrote: “I read the book from the front to the back cover. I also checked most of the references, and there are many! I confidently recommend the book to anyone. Of course, there is also something about the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but that is only a minute part of this brilliant history of religion.”</p>

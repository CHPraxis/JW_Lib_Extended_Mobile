PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 3-8
Daniel was told that “the true knowledge” would become abundant in “the time of the end.” (Daniel 12:4) This article explains how that prophecy has come true in a wonderful way. It also shows how we can be sure that Jesus is with those who serve Jehovah God.
STUDY ARTICLE 2  PAGES 9-14
Learn who the citizens of the Kingdom are. This article considers what Jehovah requires of them and how they show their love for his requirements.
STUDY ARTICLES 3, 4  PAGES 15-26
Satan often hides traps that he can use to catch us. He wants to make us do what he wants. These articles discuss how we can protect ourselves from five of his traps. They are uncontrolled speech, giving in to fear and pressure, feeling too much guilt, materialism, and the temptation to commit adultery.

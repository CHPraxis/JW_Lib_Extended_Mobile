PURPOSE OF STUDY ARTICLES
STUDY ARTICLE 1  PAGES 3-7
Jehovah’s name and purpose were highly esteemed by King David of ancient Israel. He also appreciated the principles behind God’s Law and prayed to be taught to do His will, as this article shows. The article also helps us to see why we should have Jehovah’s view of matters at all times.
STUDY ARTICLES 2, 3  PAGES 10-19
As followers of Jesus, true Christians see the need for being humble. The first article examines the pattern of humility that Jesus set so that we can follow his steps closely. The second article shows how we can cultivate the spirit of a lesser one and manifest that trait in our life.
STUDY ARTICLES 4, 5  PAGES 21-30
These articles will help us to appreciate Jehovah’s willingness to forgive even the most serious sins. Circumstances may sometimes make it difficult for us to be willing to extend forgiveness. However, Scriptural principles can help us to overcome such negative feelings in this regard.

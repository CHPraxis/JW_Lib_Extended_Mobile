<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A Pan-African project, launched by the African Union in 2007, aims to halt the desert’s advance with a green wall. From Senegal in the West to Djibouti in the East, 11 countries are planting millions of seedlings of appropriate species, in an effort to create a swath of vegetation 4,750 miles (7,600 km) long and 9 miles (15 km) wide. “We have to plant species which offer no incentive for logging,” says Aliou Guissé, professor of plant ecology at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal. It is hoped that the reforested areas will also serve as a nature reserve and provide sustainable resources for local communities.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Why Do We Yawn?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Scientists cannot explain why every person on the planet yawns<wbr />—in most cases, several times a day. Even babies in the womb do it. So do hedgehogs, ostriches, snakes, and fish. There are lots of theories, often contradictory, but none satisfy all the researchers. Many scientists have proposed that an explanation for this gulp of air, lasting six seconds on average, is to augment the brain’s oxygen supply. Yet “so far, researchers haven’t found evidence supporting this suspicion,” says <em>Science News. </em>New studies on rats seem to suggest that “a yawn may be a thermostat, cooling an overheated brain.” But no one really knows.</p>

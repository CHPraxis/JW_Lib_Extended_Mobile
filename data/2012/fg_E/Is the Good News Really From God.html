<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The good news that people will live forever on earth is written in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>) The Bible is made up of 66 smaller books. God used about 40 faithful men to write them. The first five books were written by Moses about 3,500 years ago. The last book was written by the apostle John over 1,900 years ago. Whose ideas did Bible writers present? God communicated with the Bible writers by means of his holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:2-10:23:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:2</a>) They wrote down the thoughts of God, not their own thoughts. So Jehovah is the Author of the Bible.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>2 Timothy 3:16;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <em>2 Peter 1:20, 21</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We know that the Bible is from God because it accurately foretells the future in detail. No man can do that. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14</a>) Only Almighty God can accurately foresee mankind’s future.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:9-23:42:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Isaiah 42:9;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <em>46:10</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We would expect a book from God to be unique, and it is. Billions of copies of the Bible have been distributed in hundreds of languages. Though ancient, the Bible is in harmony with proved science. Also, its 40 writers did not contradict one another.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Furthermore, the Bible bears the unmistakable stamp of God’s love, and it still has the power to change people’s lives for the better.

LESSON 9
How Can Your Family Be Happy?



1. Why is marriage vital to family happiness?






The good news comes from Jehovah, the happy God, who wants families to be happy. (1 Timothy 1:11) He originated marriage. Legal marriage is vital to family happiness because it provides a secure environment in which to raise children. Christians should respect local laws concerning the registration of marriage.​—Read Luke 2:1, 4, 5.
How does God view marriage? He wants it to be a permanent union between a man and a woman. Jehovah wants husbands and wives to be loyal to each other. (Hebrews 13:4) He hates divorce. (Malachi 2:16) But he does allow Christians to divorce and remarry if their spouse commits adultery.​—Read Matthew 19:3-6, 9.



2. How should a husband and a wife treat each other?






Jehovah created men and women to fill complementary roles in marriage. (Genesis 2:18) As family head, a husband should take the lead in providing materially for his family and in teaching them about God. He should be self-sacrificing in his love for his wife. Husbands and wives should love and respect each other. Since all husbands and wives are imperfect, learning to forgive is a key to happiness in marriage.​—Read Ephesians 4:31, 32; 5:22-25, 33; 1 Peter 3:7.



3. Should you abandon an unhappy marriage?

If you experience difficulties in your marriage, both of you should work at treating each other with love. (1 Corinthians 13:4, 5) God’s Word does not recommend separation as a way to resolve problems that are common in marriage.​—Read 1 Corinthians 7:10-13.



4. Children, what does God want for you?






Jehovah wants you to be happy. He gives you the best advice on how to enjoy your youth. He wants you to benefit from the wisdom and experience of your parents. (Colossians 3:20) Jehovah also wants you to experience the joy of doing things for your Creator and his Son.​—Read Ecclesiastes 11:9–12:1; Matthew 19:13-15; 21:15, 16.



5. Parents, how can your children find happiness?






You should work hard to provide food, housing, and clothing for your children. (1 Timothy 5:8) But for your children to find happiness, you also need to teach them to love God and to learn from him. (Ephesians 6:4) Your example in showing love for God can deeply influence your child’s heart. When based on God’s Word, your instruction can mold your child’s thinking in a positive way.​—Read Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Proverbs 22:6.
Children benefit when you encourage and commend them. They also need correction and discipline. Such training protects them from conduct that could rob them of happiness. (Proverbs 22:15) Yet, discipline should never be harsh or cruel.​—Read Colossians 3:21.
Jehovah’s Witnesses publish several books that are especially written to help parents and children. These books are based on the Bible.​—Read Psalm 19:7, 11.

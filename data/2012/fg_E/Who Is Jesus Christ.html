<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Unlike any other human, Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit person before he was born on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:23-43:8:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:23</a>) He was God’s first creation, and he helped in the creation of all other things. He is the only one created directly by Jehovah and is therefore appropriately called God’s “only-begotten” Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:14</a>) Jesus served as God’s Spokesman, so he is also called “the Word.”​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 8:22, 23,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <em>30;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> <em>Colossians 1:15, 16</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God sent his Son to earth by transferring his life from heaven to the womb of a virgin Jewess named Mary. So Jesus did not have a human father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:30-42:1:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-35</a>) Jesus came to the earth (1) to teach the truth about God, (2) to set us an example in how to do God’s will even when we are in difficulties, and (3) to give his perfect life as “a ransom.”​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 20:28</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>3. Why do we need a ransom?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A ransom is the price paid to release a person from the threat of death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:29-2:21:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 21:29, 30</a>) Death and old age were not part of God’s original purpose for mankind. How do we know that? God told the first man, Adam, that if he committed what the Bible calls “sin,” he would die. So if Adam had not sinned, he would never have died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:5-1:5:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:5</a>) According to the Bible, death “entered” the world of mankind through Adam. Thus, Adam passed on <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>to all his descendants sin and its penalty, death. We need a ransom to release us from the penalty of death that we inherited from Adam.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Romans 5:12;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <em>6:23</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Who could pay the ransom to free us from death? When we die, we pay the penalty only for our own sins. No imperfect man can pay for the sins of others.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:7-19:49:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 49:7-9</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Unlike us, Jesus was perfect. So he did not need to die for his sins​—he never committed any. Instead, Jesus died for the sins of others.

Jesus also showed love for us by obeying his Father and giving his life for our sins.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><em>John 3:16;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:18-45:5:19" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> <em>Romans 5:18, 19</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">When on earth, Jesus cured the sick, raised the dead, and rescued people in peril. He thereby demonstrated what he will do in the future for all obedient mankind.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18</a>) Jesus then waited at God’s right hand until Jehovah gave him power to rule as King over all the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:12-58:10:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>) Now Jesus is ruling as King in heaven, and his followers are announcing that good news worldwide.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><em>Daniel 7:13, 14;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <em>Matthew 24:14</em></a><em>.</em></p>

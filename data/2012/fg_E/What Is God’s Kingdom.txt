2. Why is Jesus the ideal King?

God’s Son is the ideal King because he is kind and he is firm for what is right. (Matthew 11:28-30) Also, he is powerful enough to help people because he will rule over the earth from heaven. After he was resurrected, he ascended to heaven and sat down to wait at Jehovah’s right hand. (Hebrews 10:12, 13) Finally, God gave him power to begin ruling.​—Read Daniel 7:13, 14.



3. Who will rule with Jesus?

A group called “the holy ones” will rule with Jesus in heaven. (Daniel 7:27) The first holy ones chosen were Jesus’ faithful apostles. Jehovah has continued to select faithful men and women as holy ones until now. Like Jesus, they are resurrected with a spiritual body.​—Read John 14:1-3; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44.
How many people go to heaven? Jesus called them a “little flock.” (Luke 12:32) They will finally number 144,000. They will rule over the earth with Jesus.​—Read Revelation 14:1.



4. What happened when Jesus began ruling?






God’s Kingdom began ruling in 1914.a Jesus’ first action as King was to throw Satan and his demons down to the earth. Satan became furious and began causing trouble throughout the earth. (Revelation 12:7-10, 12) Since then, mankind’s woes have severely increased. Wars, famines, epidemics, and earthquakes are all part of a “sign” that the Kingdom will soon take full charge of earth’s affairs.​—Read Luke 21:7, 10, 11, 31.



5. What does God’s Kingdom accomplish?

By means of a global preaching work, God’s Kingdom is already uniting a great crowd of people from all nations. Millions of meek people are becoming subjects of Jesus. God’s Kingdom will protect them when it destroys the present wicked system of things on earth. So all who want to benefit from God’s Kingdom should learn to be obedient subjects of Jesus.​—Read Revelation 7:9, 14, 16, 17.





During a period of 1,000 years, the Kingdom will accomplish God’s original purpose for mankind. The earth will become a global paradise. Finally, Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. (1 Corinthians 15:24-26) Do you know someone whom you would like to tell about God’s Kingdom?​—Read Psalm 37:10, 11, 29.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The true God is the Creator of all things. He had no beginning and will never have an end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>) He is the Source of the good news found in the Bible.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">No human has ever seen God because he is a Spirit, which means that he is a higher form of life than the physical creatures who live on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4:24</a>) Nevertheless, we can discern God’s personality from the things he has made. For instance, the variety of fruits and flowers tells us of his love and wisdom. The size of the universe tells us of his power.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Romans 1:20</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We can learn even more about God’s personality by reading the Bible. For example, it tells us what God likes and what he does not like, how he treats people, and how he reacts in different situations.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:7-19:103:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 103:7-10</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus said: “Our Father in the heavens, let your <em>name </em>be sanctified.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Although God has many titles, he has only one name. In each language, it is pronounced differently. In English it is usually pronounced “Jehovah.” But some people pronounce it “Yahweh.”​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 83:18</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Does widespread suffering mean that Jehovah is a God who does not care about us?

Meanwhile, he has good reason to allow suffering for a limited time.

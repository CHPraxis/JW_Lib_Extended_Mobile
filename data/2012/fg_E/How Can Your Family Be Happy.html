<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The good news comes from Jehovah, the happy God, who wants families to be happy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11</a>) He originated marriage. Legal marriage is vital to family happiness because it provides a secure environment in which to raise children. Christians should respect local laws concerning the registration of marriage.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Luke 2:1,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:4-42:2:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <em>4, 5</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How does God view marriage? He wants it to be a permanent union between a man and a woman. Jehovah wants husbands and wives to be loyal to each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>) He hates divorce. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:16-39:2:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Malachi 2:16</a>) But he does allow Christians to divorce and remarry if their spouse commits adultery.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:3-40:19:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 19:3-6,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <em>9</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah created men and women to fill complementary roles in marriage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:18</a>) As family head, a husband should take the lead in providing materially for his family and in teaching them about God. He should be self-sacrificing in his love for his wife. Husbands and wives should love and respect each other. Since all husbands and wives are imperfect, learning to forgive is a key to happiness in marriage.​—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><em>Ephesians 4:31, 32;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:25" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> <em>5:22-25,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> <em>33;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> <em>1 Peter 3:7</em></a><em>.</em></p>

LESSON 1
What Is the Good News?



1. What is the news from God?






God wants people to enjoy life on earth. He created the earth and everything on it because he loves mankind. Soon he will act to provide a better future for people in every land. He will relieve mankind of the causes of suffering.​—Read Jeremiah 29:11.
No government has ever succeeded in eliminating violence, disease, or death. But there is good news. Shortly, God will replace all human governments with his own government. Its subjects will enjoy peace and good health.​—Read Isaiah 25:8; 33:24; Daniel 2:44.



2. Why is the good news urgent?

Suffering will end only when God clears the earth of bad people. (Zephaniah 2:3) When will that happen? God’s Word foretold the conditions that now threaten mankind. Current events indicate that God’s time to act is close.​—Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5.



3. What should we do?

We should learn about God from his Word, the Bible. It is like a letter to us from a loving father. It tells us how to enjoy a better way of life now and how to enjoy everlasting life on earth in the future. True, some may not like it that you are receiving help to understand the Bible. But the opportunity of a better future is too good to miss.​—Read Proverbs 29:25; Revelation 14:6, 7.

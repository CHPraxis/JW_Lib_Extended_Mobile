<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">In this article, you will learn</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa"><strong>WHY </strong>you need role models</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa"><strong>WHERE </strong>to find them</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa"><strong>HOW </strong>to follow their example</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>WHY YOU NEED THEM</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>FACT OF LIFE: </strong><em>You tend to become like the people you admire. That can be good<wbr />—or bad—<wbr />depending on whom you admire.</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>What you need: </strong>Role models who are worthy of imitation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:17-50:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 3:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>The problem: </strong>Many people look up to individuals who are famous<wbr />—musicians, sports heroes, or movie stars—<wbr />even if these have sordid reputations.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>To think about: </strong>The Bible compares our personality traits to a garment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:9, 10</a>) If you were shopping for clothes, would you let a poorly dressed salesperson tell <em>you </em>what to wear? Why, then, let some shady celebrity dictate the kind of person <em>you </em>should be? Instead of doing that or just following the crowd, choosing good role models will help you to (1) select the traits you want to acquire and (2) imitate people who excel in displaying those traits.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">Mark the following statements <strong>true </strong>or <strong>false.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sm"> <strong>1. </strong><em>A role model must be someone you have met face-to-face.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">□<strong>True  </strong>□<strong>False</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sm"> <strong>2. </strong><em>A role model must be perfect.</em></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">□<strong>True  </strong>□<strong>False</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sm"> <strong>3. </strong><em>You can have many role models.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">□<strong>True  </strong>□<strong>False</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>1. </strong><em>False. </em>You can even choose role models from the ancient past. The best of these can be found in the Bible. For instance, if you read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">chapter 11</a> in the Bible book of Hebrews, you’ll find that the apostle Paul names 16 men and women whose faith was exemplary. Most important, in the next chapter, Paul urged Christians to “look intently” at Jesus and follow him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2</a>) Jesus is our best role model.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:15-43:13:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:15</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>2. </strong><em>False. </em>Other than Jesus, Adam had no perfect descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>) Even the heroic prophet Elijah was “just as human as we are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:17-59:5:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 5:17</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) The same may be said of such people as Miriam, David, Jonah, Martha, and Peter. The Bible candidly reveals the errors of those men and women. Still, they were exemplary in most aspects of life, and thus they can be good role models.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>3. </strong><em>True. </em>You can have as many role models as you want. One might be especially hardworking, while another may excel at being patient. Perhaps a third maintains a positive outlook in the face of problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:28-46:12:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:11-49:4:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:11, 12</a>) Look for the good in others, and you’ll find qualities they have that are worthy of imitation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><strong>HOW TO FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>1. Observe </strong>your role models. The apostle Paul told first-century Christians: “Learn by watching those who are living the way we showed you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:17-50:3:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 3:17</a>, <em>Holy Bible—<wbr />Easy-to-Read Version.</em></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>2. Connect. </strong>If possible, spend some time with those you have chosen as modern-day role models. The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>3. Reflect </strong>your role models’ praiseworthy traits. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a> says: “As you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.”</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>Action Plan</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><strong>Pick a trait </strong>that you would like to acquire. (Would you like to be more outgoing? generous? hardworking? resilient? dependable? trustworthy?)</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>Pick a person </strong>who demonstrates the quality you would like to develop.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="si">․․․․․</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">When you choose a good role model, your goal isn’t to <em>become </em>that person. You’ll still have your own unique good qualities. Nevertheless, having good role models will help bring out your best as you grow to adulthood. Not only that, by following their example, you will become a good role model for others.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p37" data-pid="37">Of course, many people of the present can also serve as good role models. These might include a parent, a sibling, a spiritually mature member of the Christian congregation, or another exemplary person you know or have read about.</p></div>
<div id="fn2" class="fcc"><p id="p38" data-pid="38">You can also do this exercise in reverse. First, pick a person whom you look up to. Next, ask yourself, ‘What particular quality makes that person admirable?’ Then, using that person as a role model, strive to imitate the quality you identified.</p></div>

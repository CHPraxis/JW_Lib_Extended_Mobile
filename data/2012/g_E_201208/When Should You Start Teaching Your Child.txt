When Should You Start Teaching Your Child?
● A man in Summerville, South Carolina, U.S.A., wrote that starting when his wife was only three months pregnant, he would lie close to her each night and read from the Bible study aid My Book of Bible Stories. “After our baby girl, Bethiah, was born,” said the father, “we continued in this same routine—one story per night, until we had read the book through three times.”
He continues: “When Bethiah could barely talk, she was already able to identify many of the Bible characters and reenact several of the Bible accounts discussed in the book. She had also learned to recite several Bible stories from memory.”
The 116 stories in this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication appear in the order in which the many Bible characters lived, thus also giving the reader insight into the Bible’s chronology.

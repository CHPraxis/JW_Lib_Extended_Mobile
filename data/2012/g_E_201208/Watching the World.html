<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Research suggests that a lack of self-control during youth may predict health problems, less financial stability and a criminal record by adulthood,” says <em>Time. </em>Over 1,000 people were studied from birth to age 32. By adulthood, “those who [as children] were more impulsive and easily frustrated and had the most trouble with delaying gratification or waiting their turn” were about three times as likely to report that they had poor health, had low incomes, were single parents, or had committed a crime. Yet, “self-control can be learned,” says the magazine, adding: “School and family interventions that teach kids to self-regulate early on may lead to healthier and more stable adults.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Authorities in India are trying new ways to deal with the worst traffic offenders by making them work as traffic police. The goal is to help drivers grasp what it means to manage the kind of chaos they cause. Now, instead of just pulling over offenders and fining them, police in Gurgaon, northwestern India, are also requiring drivers to join the constables in directing traffic for a half hour or more. Some drivers admit that the lesson has changed their attitude. “We issue a thousand [fines] for traffic offences in Gurgaon every day,” says Bharti Arora, the local deputy commissioner of police. “We could have 1000 extra ‘constables’ every day.”</p>

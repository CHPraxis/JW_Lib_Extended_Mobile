Violence Hurts Us All
WHO has not been affected by violence? We see it constantly in news reports. We fear it on the streets and at work, and children face it from bullies at school. Even at home, where people usually feel secure behind locked doors, millions—especially women—feel unsafe. In fact, depending on the country, up to 70 percent of women report that they have been assaulted by an intimate partner.
In many countries, people fear violent political or social uprisings or even terrorism. These fears are reflected in the increased level of electronic surveillance evident in some lands, especially those that have been a target of terrorism.
Understandably, the video-surveillance industry is booming—despite the global economic downturn. Who pays for all of this? Ultimately, we do, in the form of taxes and other fees. And such costs may well increase as security measures become more invasive, pervasive, and expensive.
The disturbing effects of violence should make us reflect on ourselves—our ethics and our beliefs. The following articles will consider these questions: What part does the media play in the spread of violence? What factors can influence our attitude toward violence? How can we protect ourselves from negative influences?

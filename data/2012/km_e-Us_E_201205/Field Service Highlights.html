<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are pleased to report two new all-time peaks during the month of December. The Turks and Caicos Islands reported a peak of 47 regular pioneers, and the United States reported a peak of 143,740 regular pioneers. Additionally, when compared with the same month last year, the Bahamas had a 21.4 percent increase in auxiliary pioneers and Bermuda had a 71.4 percent increase in auxiliary pioneers. Certainly, Jehovah’s people are busy inviting others to “take life’s water free.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>.</p>

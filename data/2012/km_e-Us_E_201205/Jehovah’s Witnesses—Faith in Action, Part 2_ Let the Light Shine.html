<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After Brother Rutherford and his associates were released from prison in 1919, a huge work lay ahead of the Bible Students. As depicted in the video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—Faith in Action, Part 2: Let the Light Shine, </em>the Bible Students would have many opposers, their understanding of the Scriptures would continue to grow, and their faith would be refined. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:1-39:3:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mal. 3:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:20-43:15:20" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> John 15:20</a>) After viewing the video, can you answer these questions?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Each day that passes adds a new chapter to the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses. What will the record say about <em>our </em>efforts in the ministry?

Field Service Highlights
We are pleased to report two new all-time peaks during the month of December. The Turks and Caicos Islands reported a peak of 47 regular pioneers, and the United States reported a peak of 143,740 regular pioneers. Additionally, when compared with the same month last year, the Bahamas had a 21.4 percent increase in auxiliary pioneers and Bermuda had a 71.4 percent increase in auxiliary pioneers. Certainly, Jehovah’s people are busy inviting others to “take life’s water free.”—Rev. 22:17.

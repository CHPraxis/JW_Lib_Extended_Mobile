Preach to “People of All Sorts”
 1. How are effective evangelizers like skilled craftsmen?
1 A skilled craftsman has many tools, and he knows when and how to use each one. Similarly, we have various tools to help us fulfill our work as evangelizers. For example, brochures on a variety of subjects have been produced to help us preach to “people of all sorts.” (1 Cor. 9:22) The enclosed supplement lists some of these brochures, explains whom they were designed for, and suggests how the brochures might be offered.
 2. When may we use brochures in the ministry?
2 When to Use Brochures: A craftsman will use a tool whenever it is beneficial. Similarly, we may offer a brochure whenever we feel someone would benefit, not just during months when it is the literature offer. For example, if the offer is the Bible Teach book and we are preaching in a non-Christian land where people have little interest in the Bible, it may be beneficial to offer an appropriate brochure and then introduce the Bible Teach book after we have cultivated the person’s interest.
 3. Why should we become adept at using our witnessing tools?
3 The Scriptures speak well of those who are skillful in their work. (Prov. 22:29) Certainly, no work is more important today than “the holy work of the good news.” (Rom. 15:16) In order to be “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,” we will endeavor to become adept at using our tools.—2 Tim. 2:15.

▪ Literature offer for January: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?, or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. April: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ Starting in February, the new public talk for the circuit overseers will be “Is Your Confidence in Jehovah?”
▪ Beginning with the February 1, 2012, issue, the public edition of The Watchtower will include a series entitled “My Bible Lessons.” Designed for parents to use with children who are three years of age and younger, it will alternate with the series “Teach Your Children” and “For Young People.”
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning on Friday, May 11, 2012. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on this day.

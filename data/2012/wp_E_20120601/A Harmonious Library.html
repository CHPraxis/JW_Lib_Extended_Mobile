<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 PETER 1:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>HOW IS THE BIBLE DIFFERENT? </strong>Even contemporaneous records from ancient times often contradict one another. Books written by different men, in different places, at different times rarely harmonize completely. Yet, the Bible claims that all of its 66 books have but one Author<wbr />—presenting a unified and harmonious message.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>AN EXAMPLE: </strong>Moses, a shepherd of the 16th century B.C.E., wrote in the Bible’s first book that a “seed” would come to save mankind. This book later foretold that the seed would be a descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:26:24-1:26:24" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 26:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:28:14-1:28:14" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 28:14</a>) About 500 years later, the prophet Nathan revealed that the seed would be in the royal line of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:7:12-10:7:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:12</a>) One thousand years after that, the apostle Paul explained that the seed would be made up of Jesus and a group of his chosen followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:1-45:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:29-48:3:29" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 29</a>) Finally, by the end of the first century C.E., the last book of the Bible prophesied that members of the seed would bear witness to Jesus on earth, be raised to heaven, and rule with him for 1,000 years. This composite seed will destroy the Devil and save mankind.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:6-66:20:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 20:6-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>WHAT BIBLE COMMENTATORS SAY: </strong>After a thorough investigation of the Bible’s 66 books, Louis Gaussen wrote that he was astonished by “the imposing unity of this book, composed during fifteen hundred years by so many authors, . . . who yet pursued one and the same plan, and advanced constantly, as if they themselves understood it, towards that one great end, the history of the world’s redemption by the Son of God.”<wbr />—<em>Theopneusty—<wbr />The Plenary Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>WHAT DO YOU THINK? </strong>Would you expect a book written over a span of more than 1,500 years by some 40 different men to be totally harmonious? Or is the Bible unique?</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sc">“When these writings are put together, they constitute, structurally, one book . . . There is nothing exactly resembling it, or even approaching it, in all literature.”<wbr />—<em>THE PROBLEM OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, </em>BY JAMES ORR</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I have traced all things from the start with accuracy.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:3-42:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">LUKE 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>HOW IS THE BIBLE DIFFERENT? </strong>Legends and myths relate fanciful tales that omit specific locations, dates, and names of historical figures. In contrast, the Bible includes countless historical details that reassure readers that its “sayings are supremely true.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:160-19:119:160" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:160</a>, <em>The Psalms for Today, </em>by R. K. Harrison.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>AN EXAMPLE: </strong>The Bible reports that “Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon . . . took [Judean King] Jehoiachin into exile to Babylon.” Later, “Evil-merodach the king of Babylon, in the year of his becoming king, raised up the head of Jehoiachin the king of Judah out of the house of detention.” Furthermore, “an allowance was constantly given him [Jehoiachin] from the king, daily as due, all the days of his life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:11-12:24:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:24:15-12:24:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:25:27-12:25:30" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 25:27-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>WHAT ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE DISCOVERED: </strong>Among the ruins of ancient Babylon, archaeologists uncovered administrative documents dated to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. They list rations given to prisoners and others dependent on the royal household. The lists include “Yaukin [Jehoiachin],” who was the “king of the land of Yahud (Judah),” and his household. What about the existence of Nebuchadnezzar’s successor, Evil-merodach? An inscription on a vase found near the city of Susa reads: “Palace of Amil-Marduk [Evil-merodach], King of Babylon, son of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon.”</p>

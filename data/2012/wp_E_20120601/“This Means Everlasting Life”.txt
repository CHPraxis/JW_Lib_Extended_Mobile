“This Means Everlasting Life”
“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—JOHN 17:3.
KNOWLEDGE can save life. When ten-month-old Nouhou fell sick, his mother—a community health worker in Niger—knew what to do. She prepared an oral rehydration solution for her son by mixing sugar, salt, and clean water. According to UNICEF, because of her “quick response and access to community health care, her child’s illness was cut short.”
Knowledge from the Bible can also save life. The first Bible writer, Moses, stated: “It is no valueless word for you, but it means your life, and by this word you may lengthen your days.” (Deuteronomy 32:47) Can the Bible really lengthen our days? In what way does it mean our life?
The preceding five articles in this series have shown that the Bible is a book incomparable in its reliable prophecy, historical and scientific accuracy, internal harmony, and practical guidance. This stamps the Bible as unique. So, when it claims to point the way to a longer life—everlasting life—does it not deserve your careful consideration?
We urge you to learn how accurate knowledge of the Bible can lead to peace of mind now and happiness in the future. Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to show you how to acquire such knowledge.

The Bible is also unique in that it alone gives satisfying answers to fundamental questions we ask:
• Why are we here?
• Why is there so much suffering?
• Is there any hope for my dead loved ones?
You can find the Bible’s answers to these questions in this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

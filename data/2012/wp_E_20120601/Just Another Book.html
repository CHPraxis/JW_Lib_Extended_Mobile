<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial . . . , that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 TIMOTHY 3:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SOME people hesitate to make such an unqualified statement about the Bible. What about you? Which of the following best describes how you view the Bible?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">• A work of fine literature</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">• One of several equally acceptable sacred texts</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">• A book of legends with underlying moral lessons</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">• The Word of God</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A related question is, Does it matter what you believe? Consider what the Bible says about itself: “All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) The Bible thus claims that it is designed to instruct and comfort us and to give us hope.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, if the Bible were merely a work of literature or just one of many holy books, would you trust it to instruct you and guide your family, especially if its message differed from what you thought to be right? If the Bible were a collection of myths, would you derive comfort and hope from its promises?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">On the other hand, millions who have studied the Bible are convinced that it is the unique Word of God. Why? What distinguishes the Bible from all other books? We invite you to consider five unique features of the Bible, described in the following articles.</p>

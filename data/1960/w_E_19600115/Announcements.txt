FIELD MINISTRY
As an aid to “making the mind over for the new world,” during January Jehovah’s witnesses will offer to all persons of good will a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and three informative Bible booklets, for $1. For information as to how you may share, write us or contact the congregation at the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses.
WHAT WILL 1960 BRING YOU?
Will the year 1960 bring you peace of mind? Will it bring you security and hope for the future? Will it bring you faith and favor with God? It can! Regular reading of the Bible and following its teachings closely will bring you this and more. To insure your full appreciation of what you read you need The Watchtower also. Study it with your Bible and receive the most the new year has to offer you. Send $1 at once for a year’s subscription and you will be sent free the booklets “This Good News of the kingdom,” After Armageddon—God’s New World and Healing of the Nations Has Drawn Near.

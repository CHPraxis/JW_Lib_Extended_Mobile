<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Long ago the prophet Amos foretold that there would be a spiritual famine in the land. That famine is evident today in lands professing to be Christian. Responsibility for it rests upon Christendom’s churches and is occasionally admitted by them. The <em>Christian Recorder </em>said: “The Church today is like a rusty pipe disconnected from the source of supply.” The president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand remarked: “We are so busy maintaining our Church and running the multiplicity of Church organisations that we have neither time nor strength to take the Gospel out into the world.” Another clergyman remarked in the Charlotte <em>News: </em>“I sometimes wonder if we in the church haven’t been giving our children stones when they are asking for bread, giving them gadgets when they really want God.”</p>

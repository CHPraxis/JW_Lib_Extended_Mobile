The Bible Record of Creation Vindicated
In the periodical Förkunnaren, which means the Publisher, that is, of God’s Word, the astronomer Arvid Ljunghall, Ph. D., has written an ingenious article on natural science and the Bible record of creation. He concludes: “It may be said, then, that the epoch-making new thing from a Christian viewpoint, that has appeared is that there has been found practically incontrovertible evidence that our world is of a limited age, that there was a time when the universe and matter did not exist, and that for this reason a creation must have taken place. We are thus now confronted with the remarkable fact that the Bible account of creation, that was so unscientific, so wholly strange to scientific thinking, when our century was young, is now wholly in line with the modern idea of the universe.” “He who wants to be in earnest about Christianity and proceed from the belief that there is a God, who is the Creator of everything, he does not need to believe against all rhyme and reason, against all sense and scientific investigation. His belief is fully in line with the idea of the universe that science holds today.”—Svenska Dagbladet, December 16, 1958.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"> When prophesying of the last days the Bible said people would be having “a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:5</a>) In view of this it is interesting to note what the magazine <em>Cosmopolitan </em>of April, 1958, said: “Moreover, it becomes clear that a person may profess one faith but live by another. Pollsters found this out when they queried Americans about their belief in God. Although ninety-seven percent quickly affirmed their belief, more than seventy percent admitted that their belief did not play an essential role in their lives. For many such Americans, success or social prestige is the most important thing in life; hence it is their real faith. For many people, following a dictator or a political leader is a faith.”</p>

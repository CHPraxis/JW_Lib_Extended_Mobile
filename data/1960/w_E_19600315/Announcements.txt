OBSERVE THE LORD’S EVENING MEAL
All persons of good will are invited to be present when Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world assemble on Sunday evening, April 10, after 6 p.m., Standard Time, to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. The meeting will be opened with song and prayer. A discourse will follow, setting forth the significance of the occasion. At the appropriate time the emblems, unleavened bread and red wine, will be served after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked separately in connection with each. The meeting will be closed with song and prayer, after all present have been invited to have part in special field service arrangements. If any of our readers do not know where the meetings are held, write to this office for information.

FIELD MINISTRY
By means of The Watchtower men of good will are helped to seek reconciliation with God and his perfect government. During March a subscription for this magazine will be presented for $1. New subscribers will receive three Bible booklets on important subjects of present-day interest. If you would like to share in this work, get further instructions at the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or write to the publishers of this magazine.
WILL YOU PROFIT FROM GOD’S WILL?
Millions of persons regularly repeat the Lord’s prayer containing the words: “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” God’s will is certain to be done. But would it surprise you to know that the majority of those who voice this request will never receive its benefits? And do you know why? Because they have never taken the time to learn what God’s will really is. Do you know? Find out! Send for and read the 384-page book “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” It is only 50c.

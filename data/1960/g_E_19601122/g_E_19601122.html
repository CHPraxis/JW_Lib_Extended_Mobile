<p><span class="font1">W asm a young minister was delivering </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">Bible lecture. Then suddenly his mind went blank, and for a seemingly endless two or three seconds he groped in confusion until he collected his thoughts. Thereafter, for the rest of his discourse, he strove valiantly to regain his confidence and poise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What had happened? In scanning the faces in his audience he noticed a poker-face expression of apparent indifference on the part of one whose judgment he respected. That was enough to throw him off balance. The remedy, of course, is for him to learn to be less impressionable and to have more self-control, more power of concentration. But there is also a lesson in this true-life incident for all listeners, namely, that their attitude, as expressed by their faces, their interest or lack of interest, can make it easier or harder for a speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Giving a helping hand, as it were, under such conditions is termed giving moral support. By it we assure another of our good will, that he has friends, those that love him and that are interested in his making good. It is but another example of the power of love and the value </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">empathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because it is not good for man to be alone, either physically or emotionally, we have an obligation to our fellow man in this respect. A man would be alone, even in a crowd, if none were favorably disposed toward him. He would be without moral support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, a dedicated Christian is never really alone; he has support from God’s Word and God’s spirit, and he can always talk with God in prayer. With these aids he can endure, even when isolated from others. Jesus Christ did. At the time of his betrayal and death, when the moral support of others would have been most welcome, they fled. It is important to appreciate our obligation to give moral support, in line with the Scriptural injunctions: “You must love your fellow as yourself.” “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.”—Lev. 19:18; Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ttie obligation to give moral support enters into all our relations. We owe it, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font1">example, to the one for whom we work, our employer, foreman or overseer. He may not be able to get all the co-operation he is entitled to and would like to have, but to the extent that we go beyond the minimum required of us we are giving him moral support. Today the trend is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font1">niggardly in giving such moral support, which is to be expected in view of what Bible prophecy has to say about our critical times.—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, it also works the other way. A good employer, foreman or overseer will give moral support to those working for him. In what ways? He can do this by showing consideration in assigning tasks, in not expecting the same from each one, in not being harsh. And especially can he give moral support by expressing appreciation for good effort or for work well done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moral support is also what husbands and wives owe each other. “Love builds up,” we are told, and each should build up the other. A husband can build up his wife by consideration and respect, by appreciation, praise and compliments. Especially should he do so when he notes that she is feeling low; then a little praise for her efforts or on her appearance will be like refreshing water to a thirsty soul. In such ways the husband will be heeding the counsel to love his wife as he does his own body.—1 Cor. 8:1; Eph. 5:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not that wives do not owe moral support to their husbands. They do. A wife can build up her husband by showing respect, by being tactful, by complying with his wishes. Knowing that he has competition all day long, she will not give him further competition when he gets home but will give him co-operation instead. Manifesting “godly devotion along with self-sufficiency” is another way in which wives can give their husbands moral'support.—1 Tim. 6:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The parent-child relationship furnishes another rich field for giving mutual moral support. Modem youths are woefully lacking in this respect. Though unable to support themselves and lacking in knowledge, they presume to rule the roost by taking advantage of the fondness of their parents for them. They choose to ignore the debt of respect and obedience they owe their parents. Not that parents need their children, but because parents love their children, the children can make them happy. Even Jehovah God says that: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me.”—Prov. 27:11; Eph. 6:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And again the converse is true: parents owe moral support to their children. Sincere words of commendation and encouragement for proper conduct, good work done, or unselfishness expressed, give moral support. Above all, setting a proper example does so, for children instinctively want to look up to their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many other examples of the value of moral support might be cited, such as in the relations between the member of a Christian congregation and his overseer, and the man on the street and the peace officer. And is not this why there is always a cheering squad at a scholastic football game? In giving moral support, let us give generously, and without adding a price tag to it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible tells us that shortly after the Israelites crossed the Red Sea they were attacked by the Amalekites. So long as Moses kept his hands lifted up his people were victorious. As they became weary, Aaron and Hur supported Moses’ arms, thus assuring victory. (Ex. 17:8-13) In the battle of life, in the fight of faith, we can help others gain the victory by giving them moral support. As a wise king long ago expressed it: “As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it.” “A word at its right time is 0 how good!”—Prov. 25:11; 15:23.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Why I*** /</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">S</span><span class="font1">OME professions promise prestige, others fame and fortune, but Christianity holds forth none of these as immediate rewards for having followed in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Instead of fame, the Christian apostle Paul says: “We have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, and we are so now.” Instead of glory, Paul declares Christians have become fools for Christ’s sake. Instead of having strength, they are weak. Instead of honor, they are held in dishonor. ■ They are often hungry, thirsty, naked, a people knocked about and homeless, unwelcomed in the world and of whom the world is not worthy.—1 Cor. 4:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet, despite this unpleasant outlook, a great crowd of people today are taking, up the Christian religion. They are aware of the hard life that lies before them, but this does not deter them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, did not promise those who would follow him a life of ease. He assured them that Christianity was a narrow road of hard knocks, that they would no doubt be reviled, persecuted and defamed, even as he was. “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted,” said Paul. —2 Tim. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before leaving the earth Jesus told his disciples that such would be the case. He said: “These things I command you, that you love one another. If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you. Bear in mind the word I said to you, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font1">slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they have observed my word, they will observe yours also.” (John 15:17-20) Jesus spelled out no life of ease for his followers. Their reception would be a cool one, even as his was. But Jesus also knew that this would not be a deterring factor to one who sincerely desired to become a Christian. The power of Christianity is unto salvation and it is strong enough to win over all obstacles, as Jesus himself so perfectly proved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a certain scribe said to Jesus: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you are about to go,” Jesus replied: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” In substance Jesus was saying to the man, ‘Sir, are you willing to give up your comfortable surroundings to follow me?’ Then, as today, there were more who wanted to receive the benefits of Christianity than there were persons who were willing to sacrifice something for them.—Matt. 8:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To his disciples Jesus said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">follow me continually.” (Matt. 16:24) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font1">meant setting aside selfish ambitions, putting true worship first in one’s life. Some might have been willing to follow him a day or two, but to “pick up his torture stake and follow [him] continually,” well, that was asking too much of them, so they thought. The torture stake represents the suffering and shame or torture that must be endured as a follower, not only today or tdmorrow, but this week, next week, continually. No, a Christian’s life is not an easy one and there are not many willing to disown themselves for the sake of Christ or life itself.—Matt. 19:29.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Reasons for Becoming a Christian</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Why do some become Christians? Of Jesus it is written: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Jesus found joy in doing God’s will. “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.” Christians who follow Jesus’ footsteps closely experience this same joy and satisfaction in serving God.—Heb. 12:2; Ps. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to happiness and contentment, Christianity gives one peace, because it is of the God of peace. In this chaotic world a rewarding peace is a tremendous force to attract people to Christianity. The apostle Paul urges Christians to rejoice in the Lord and not to be anxious over anything, “but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God, and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” Outside the Christian congregation true peace cannot be found. —Phil. 4:4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet there is an even more impelling reason why individuals take hold of Christianity. What is that? The fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the One sent forth into the world by God and who set the pattern that men must follow in order to please God. With a sincere desire to do the will of their God and Father in heaven, persons out of all races and tongues exert themselves to walk in Jesus’ footsteps. —Luke 1:32; 1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Power of Christianity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The magnetic power of Christianity is in its message. “My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed.” (John 10:27, 28) The voice of the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, carries with it drawing power. He who speaks from the heart is able to reach hearts; he who is lowly will uplift; he who is all love will inspire love in others; he whose soul is great will strengthen the weak and lonely. This Jesus Christ did; this the Christian message does. People who are of good will toward God listen to the Christian message and are revitalized by it. They find peace, joy and hope in it. These are the ones that become Christ’s followers—Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Christian message is the message of the Kingdom. Jesus wished neither to be the restorer of fallen worldly kingdoms nor the conqueror of hostile realms of his day. He was not of this world, his kingdom was not of this world, and his followers are not of this world. Concerning his followers he said: “They are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world.” (John 17:14) This fact has a liberating effect, an appeal which draws men into the Christian fold.—John 18:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus advocated God’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind. Therefore he cared nothing for worldly power or its glory. He taught his followers to be of the same disposition that he was toward this world. This fact has been a great safeguard and a source of great freedom to them. It has freed them from religious and traditional holidays and their burdens. It has released them from the strains of worldly bickerings and political strifes. Some religious leaders complain that the Christian religion in the modern period “is otherworldly, escapist and irrelevant to the problems of this life.” Not so! The Christian religion is following the Christian principle of separateness from this world. Christendom’s religions have ignored this principle and have allied themselves with this world, becoming its close friend, thus an enemy of God. (Jas. 4:4) Such unchristian alignment has involved them in wars and revolutions, in political and social squabbles. So much have Christendom’s religions become a part of this world that the two are now indistinguishable. Jesus freed his people from such madness by making them advocates of the kingdom of God. “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness,” was his wise counsel, and all necessary things pertaining to life will be added to you. This too has an appealing ring to men of righteousness.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Kingdom Hope</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The kingdom Jesus proclaimed and taught his followers to pray for has nothing in common with the kingdoms of this world. His kingdom is destined to abolish the kingdoms of the earth. The kingdom of heaven, which is one, will supplant the kingdoms of the earth, which are many. No longer will there be on earth kings and subjects, masters and slaves, rich and poor. The citizens of God’s kingdom will form one family, and life under that kingdom will be abundant, as Jesus promised.—John 10:10,-Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was the hope of living in or under that kingdom that stirred the hearts of many to become Christians. Not understanding the kingdom to be heavenly, the apostles asked Jesus before he ascended into the heavens: “Master, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” Jesus told them that a world-wide witness work would have to be carried on first. The foundation of the Kingdom, however, was laid back there in A.D. 33. And the apostles and disciples of Jesus Christ, the King of the kingdom, became its representatives and ambassadors substituting for Christ, begging men to “become reconciled to God.” Hope in the kingdom of God became a powerful force, attracting men to become Christian witnesses of the Most High.—Acts 1:6-8; 2 Cor. 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The kingdom is not the forgotten dream of a handful of Jews who lived two thousand years ago; it has not become a thing of antiquity, a dead memory, a madness that is past, as some have charged. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">kingdom is of today, of tomorrow, of all time to come, a reality. Since its establishment in the heavens A.D. 1914, every dedicated servant of God may contribute toward the proclamation of this fact. Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.&quot; —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The announcement may not strike you as a new one, and the message indeed seems old, since Jesus, when on earth, called for men to “repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” he being the King of the Kingdom in their midst. But the Kingdom, as a fact, in its establishment and accomplishment in the heavens as it now stands, is new, fresh, born but forty-seven years ago; it is still growing. Like a great tree or a growing mountain, it is destined to fill the whole earth. And every time a man makes an effort to subject himself or a woman herself to its authority, this fact becomes added evidence confirming the Kingdom’s existence and realty. It becomes an added reason for proclaiming the Kingdom’s perpetual holiness and superiority over all kingdoms on earth. It is another reason for becoming a Christian.-—Matt. 4:17; Dan. 2:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom’s establishment is evidence that a new world is at hand, a world where life and peace will be without end. God-fearing people want to live in that world; that is why they become Christians. There is no other way to salvation. Jesus made this fact clear when he said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) The apostle John tells us that the world we now live in is “passing away </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” To remain forever, one must live forever. Jesus gives promise of this possibility, saying: “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life.” “Most truly I say to you, He that believes has everlasting life.” “He that feeds on this bread will live forever.” “The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.” In the words of some officers in Jesus’ day: “Never has another man spoken like this.” His is a powerful, irresistible, unmistakable message about life everlasting. It inspires conviction and wins people to the side of Christianity to this very day.—1 John 2:17; John 6:40, 47, 58, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">63; 7:46.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>High Moral Standards</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Christian principles and the religion’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">high </span><span class="font1">standard of moral living are also </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">at</span><span class="font1">tracting forces to the cause of Christianity. The apostle Paul admonishes Christians to deaden their body members respecting “fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.” He urges them to put away “wrath, anger, injuriousness, abusive speech, and obscene talk” out of their mouths, and for them not to be lying to one another, to strip off the old personality with its practices, and to clothe themselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being renewed according to the image of Christ. (Col. 3:5-11) Christianity provides the principles for an all-clean Christian society. This is also an attracting force to all people who want to live decently according to God’s arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These high standards are admittedly not seen in Christendom, because Christendom is not Christian but worldly—pagan. However, these high standards are practiced today in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Within the New World society Christian principles are enforced. The fruits of Christian living are felt, to the blessing of all who become its members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christianity assures hope of everlasting life in a righteous new world; it creates a oneness that brings peace; it provides the principles that make for pleasant associations; it satisfies man’s desire to serve God. It therefore provides the only sensible course to take in these critical times. Are not these reasons enough for becoming a Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and</span><span class="font16"> J </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.—Matt. 11:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">namely, spiritual ways.—Matt. 22:39; ICor. 11:7-9.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19601122_files/g_E_19601122-4.png" alt="" style="width:217pt;height:211pt;">

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">OSMETFCS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Do not misunderstand; it is good to look nice, but overemphasis on this to the exclusion of spiritual values is certainly not wise. Women who concentrate on physical beauty, to the exclusion of building up the qualities of the mind and heart, find they have a harder time holding on to their husbands. While it is a lift to a man’s ego to have a pretty wife, other things are important to him too. He wants his woman to be a good companion, a kind mother, a capable cook, a charming hostess and a reasonable housekeeper. Perhaps, above all else, he wants her to be spiritually-minded. These are the things that endear a woman to a man, not just looks. --1 Pet. 3:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">F</span><span class="font1">OR a woman to possess beauty is to her a rare source of happiness indeed. But she would be terribly mistaken to think that physical beauty alone is enough. A beautiful face and a lovely form are a big help, but they are not absolutely necessary for getting along in life. It takes more than good looks. Talent and ability, alonj, with a large measure of spirituality, are far more essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is nothing wrong in wanting to be physically beautiful, however. Nature teaches us that our God loves beauty. Basically, the desire to be beautiful is an expression of his royal law of love—the love of neighbor and the love of self. Since woman was created for the sake of the man, as the Bible teaches, her inborn desire is to please him, so that he, in turn, will care for her. Being beautiful is a woman’s way of showing the man that he has made a right choice or that she cares for him. But outward beauty in itself will not please man for long. A woman must have other ways of showing that she cares,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">European and Oriental women who seem to be less conscious of physical beauty but work hard at developing a quiet and mild spirit appear to do much better at holding their husbands than women in other parts of the world who ignore or neglect these qualities; at least, divorce figures would seem to indicate this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, much can be said about physical beauty and what cosmetics have done to enhance the beauty of women. Unfortunately, the use of cosmetics has been carried to such extremes that all too often the results, instead of adding to a woman’s attractiveness, do quite the opposite. If some women only knew where to stop and used cosmetics in moderation and sensibly they might succeed in accomplishing the result that is the primary reason for cosmetics, which is to beautify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While many women who are plain or lack lovely skins or complexions may be able to improve their appearance by an artistic use of cosmetics, still there are many more who are far more attractive without make-up of any sort, yet who conceal their natural beauty, their lovely skins and complexions and alter their features by the liberal or over-use of cosmetics merely because it is the present fashion to do so. This, of course, is an objectionable feature of cosmetics. However, the users and not the product are to be blamed for such indiscretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Intelligent men and women have never viewed cheap painting and thoughtless powdering as a substitute for natural beauty. Beauty is more than a simple putting on of creams and powders. Take the face, for example. Nine times out of ten your face is the part of your body that people see first. And more often than not, it is your face that makes the first impression, and it is that impression that counts most with many people. They seem to remember it the longest. Girls from twelve to fourteen have a wholesome, natural appearance without the application of any cosmetic whatsoever. In fact, make-up often detracts from beauty rather than enhancing it in youth. Youthful faces radiate a freshness without make-up. They really do not need it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Changing Beauty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The face, however, changes with age. For one thing, it takes on interest. And an interesting face is just as important as a beautiful one. A beautiful face is not always one with perfect features, but more often one that reflects a responding heart. Think of the beauty wrapped up in a single smile! And how beautiful are the eyes that shine! What beauty and excitement there are in laughter! So a little outward beauty and a whole lot of inner glow for an appreciation of life are what make the face truly beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But even beautiful features, such as our eyes, nose and lips, which are given to us at birth, must not be neglected but cared for or else they lose their luster and natural beauty. A woman past the age of thirty-five can make her eyes sparkle with as much interest as her daughter, if she tries. Her skin may not be as youthful as her daughter’s, but it can be just as fresh with a little care. As she grows older, her remaining beautiful will necessitate a little more attention and a change in make-up, if cosmetics are used. Women in their sixties often find that they appear most charming in shades of a cameo pink. The dark tones against a light skin make them look harsh and old. But regardless of age, too much make-up cheapens one’s appearance. It indicates “no background.’’ No make-up at all is better than too much or the wrong kind. People of taste prefer you to look like yourself. Men, especially, do not like their women to look made up. They want their women to appear naturally beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A right application of make-up can do much for the face. It can make a long nose look short or a short nose look long. It can make a chin appear larger or smaller, make the eyes seem brighter and the lips more inviting. It can also make a face of any shape look almost oval, which is the classical standard for facial beauty. Powder bases can put color into sallow skin, take the pink out of skin that looks flushed, cover over “blotches,&quot; disguise veins, freckles, large pores and blend all the areas of a face into a pleasant single tone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make-up can be a boost to a woman’s morale. For example, in England during World War II cosmetics were declared a luxury. Lipstick became scarce. When lipstick was again provided, work output increased and women’s whole general attitude is said to have changed for the better.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Fact or Fiction?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Cosmetics can do many things, but not all that advertisers claim for them. In recent years some preparations have been misrepresented as skin foods and tonics. Others have been advertised as “contour creams” for bust development or bust reducing, wrinkle eradicators and “deep pore” cleansers. Some make elaborate promises. “Is it difficult for you to charm the man you want? Then try our lipstick and he is yours.” “Has your husband’s love for you faded? Use our beauty cream and he will love you with a love that will keep you eternally young and lovely.” “Are you without a job? No wonder, look at your hands! Use our hand lotion and the job is yours.” And so on, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad</span><span class="font1"> nauseam, read the advertisements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is amazing how many otherwise intelligent people are taken in by such slogans. When S. L. Mayhem, executive vicepresident of the Toilet Goods Association, was asked why women were so gullible about the absurd claims and prices of cosmetics, the executive replied in a single word—“hope.” For there is always hope that what is said might be true. If a $5 jar of cream does not perform the miracle, there is always hope that the $10 or the $25 jar might. Some of these exotic creams are worth their weight in gold, for they sell for $50, $20 and $15 an ounce! “Women seem to want the snob appeal of high-priced cosmetics,” says one report. A cream that has been on the market for sixty years is said not to be a top seller today simply because it is not expensive enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So far there is no evidence whatever that any of the creams, cheap or expensive, have erased a single wrinkle or slowed down the aging process one bit. As for the ingredients that go into these creams, basically they are about the same. Generally, they are made of lanolin or of an inexpensive oil base that softens and soothes the skin. The most expensive varieties do no more. The major difference is in the perfume used and in the shape and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">quality of the jar—not the cream. The </span><span class="font1">plain, simple truth is that milady will not become one mite more beautiful nor will her skin be benefited any more by using expensive creams than by the use of ordinary cold creams. The beneficial results obtained are mainly in the stimulation brought about by the massaging when applied and not so much by the cream itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Women who pass the age of thirty begin to think they look like wrecks, because advertisers say so. Their scheme is to get women believing that only special preparations can save them, that their priceless asset is their soft, beautiful skin. It is a fact that attractive women in their thirties and forties have kept their good complexions either through avoidance of, or in spite of, these “miracle” preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Actually there is no such thing as a “skin food.” Skin specialists state that a balanced diet, plenty of exercise, relaxation and sleep will do more for your skin than all the high-priced creams in the world. If you have skin blemishes that you wish corrected, then see a skin specialist, not a salesman.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Tips and Dangers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">In recent years dangerous cosmetics have almost completely vanished, but there are still a few things that it is good to know about some of them. For example, hair bleach is essentially hydrogen peroxide. Extensive use of peroxide often leaves the hair dry and brittle. Such hair is difficult to manage and is curl resistant to cold-wave solutions. Veronica L. Conley, according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consumer Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> warned that long-continued use of hydrogen peroxide is likely to cause progressive damage to the hair shaft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Laboratory experiments have disclosed that some of the substances in hair sprays can cause cancer-like growths in rats and mice. Their effect on humans is still not known. Three Missouri doctors have discovered two cases where the lymph nodes were inflamed and the patients became ill from inhaling aerosol hair sprays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some manufacturers make durability claims for their brands of lipstick. “Keep bright lively color on your lips 24 hours a day.” Tests have proved that the color of these brands after a few hours showed wear. For satisfactory results they had to be reapplied about as frequently as those for which no special durability claims are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lipstick dyes and chemicals can cause either primary irritation or allergic reaction in the form of dryness, blistering, peeling or swelling to some users. It would be wise to discontinue the use of any brand that causes lip irritation or swelling. It has been found that individual differences in method of application, as well as the condition of the lips, influence the results obtained as much as the quality of the product itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently New York manufacturers have capitalized on dihydroxyacetone, a chemical that gives skin that sun-tan look. Manufacturers have combined this chemical with alcohol and perfume and are selling it at from $3 to $5 a bottle as a &quot;no-sun” tan lotion. It tans merely the upper layer of skin, and the color lasts for about ten days. Some persons have complained, however, that their skin gets blotched from the product. So use care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Press-on nail color for fingernails that does away with delicate brushwork, smears, spills, sealers and removers, and so forth, according to a manufacturer’s guarantee, is supposed to “last three times as long as liquid polish.” The product is rated better than nail polish, but some women say it softens their nails or splits the ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such things as “royal jelly,” a substance from bees’ glands, that are supposed to act as “rejuvenators,” and are called “fabulously effective,” actually have no proved therapeutic or restorative powers whatsoever. The only effective jolt received is from the inflated prices and not from the jelly. As </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Barron’s</span><span class="font1"> magazine pointed out: “Since only about 100 milligrams is needed in an ounce of facial cream, the added cost of an ordinary size jar is only about 20c, yet it has been established as a luxury item and creams containing it sell as high as $15 a jar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many manufacturers claim that their brands include a foundation cream, which makes a light application of vanishing cream preceding the powdering unnecessary. Tests made of these products showed that for good results a base cream was still needed. Eleanore King, a Hollywood beauty consultant, said: “In eleven years of intense perusal of my students’ skins, I saw no more than five that I thought looked better without a base.” In face powders, as with many other products, price is not a reliable guide to quality. A relatively low 39c, %-ounce cake of powder was found to be of very high quality. But who would suspect it at that price?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How many beauty preparations does one need? The average girl does not need many and certainly she does not need fancy preparations. Choose a product and not a fancy package. Read labels, look for seals of approval, stick to proved, tested products with reliable names. They need not be costly. Buy in small jars first until you have found what is right for you. Above all, for real beauty accent your inner charm, that “secret person of the heart.”—1 Pet. 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is little doubt that cosmetics will continue to find an eager market—to the joy of many and the dismay of some. Depending on personal taste, yes, even religion, some will approve of a few of the products and frown on the rest; others love them all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Thus in January of this year a wall collapsed on twenty firemen fighting a blaze in Chicago, Illinois, of which number nine were crushed to death and others suffered severe injuries. During the previous November a similar accident caused the death of three firemen and injured eleven others in a downtown New York city fire. In the Texas City, Texas, 1947 conflagration the entire volunteer fire department was wiped out, and a few years before, an explosion in the harbor of Bombay took the lives of forty firemen. For the past hundred years in New York city an average of ten firemen have lost their lives annually. And each year one fireman out of eight receives injuries, some 1,500 out of a force of 12,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just who were the first fire fighters is not known. What is definitely known is that fire fighting goes back at least to the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. As far back as 200 B.C., a Greek invented a machine for pumping water at fires.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">got its start with “The Great Fire” of London, in 1666, which began on September 2 and lasted for five days. It turned into ashes 373 acres of the city, including 13,200 dwellings and upward of a hundred chapels, churches, libraries, hospitals and suchlike buildings, not to say anything of the destruction of bridges and city gates. This jolted the Londoners into action. Men now gave thought to training in fire fighting and rescue operations, how to use ladders and other fire equipment, which now began to be manufactured. The following year saw the beginning of fire insurance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Fire Fighting</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Fire fighting has a fascination all its own, which accounts for the fact that many a man prefers it as a profession to some other that may be more rewarding financially and less hazardous. This fascination also accounts for the existence of fire buffs, the enthusiasts who not only like to watch fire fighting but who at times pitch in and help. New York city’s best-known fire buff was none other than its Mayor LaGuardia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About a hundred years ago, when the New York city fire department first got its start, it advertised for “'strong, able, discreet, honest and sober men.” But not to be overlooked are the requirements of courage, intelligence, quick reflexes, steady nerves and stamina. Firemen must be able to work hard at a fire over long stretches of time and in almost unbearable conditions. A fireman never knows what he might run up against. But this he does know: “No two fires are ever alike.” In the Maine forest fires of 1947, which destroyed hundreds of square miles of timber, firemen fought for eight days with but fourteen hours of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The senior officer in charge of a fire must be a chemist, an engineer, a mechanic and an electrician all in one, and his men also, to a lesser extent. At a large fire he must have the qualifications of a general, know where to place his men, the dangers involved, where the water should be applied, when to pull the men out before walls collapse, and, above all, be able to think and act quickly. As has well been said, speed is the essence of fire fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fire fighters have three basic duties to perform at a fire: First and most important is the saving of lives; never should the saving of property come ahead of the saving of lives. Secondly comes the containing of the fire, or keeping it from spreading, from getting out of control and turning into a conflagration. And then comes the extinguishing of the fire itself by attacking it as closely as humanly possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A fire requires three indispensable factors: heat, fuel and oxygen. Remove any of the three and the fire goes out. So firemen proceed along these lines. The simplest and most frequently used method is to cut down the heat by means of water. However, when oil or other inflammable liquids are burning, water merely spreads the flames and so the attempt is made to cut off the oxygen by means of chemical foam or various kinds of “fog.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third method, that ot removing the fuel, is practical only in very small or very large fires. Tossing a burning mattress out of a window is one way of removing fuel from a fire, thus starving it. In a great city conflagration or large forest fire efforts are made to contain the fire by means of a “break,” which in a city fire may mean dynamiting buildings in the wake of the fire and in a forest fire may require a “scorched earth” effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In New York city it takes six months of probationary training to become a fireman. The first eight weeks of this period are spent in four courses or units of two weeks each. During the first, the “Proby,” as he is called, is instructed in the theoretical aspects of fire fighting. In addition to policy as to conduct he is taught such basic things as simple hydraulics, chemistry of fire fighting, first aid and fire prevention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next two weeks he works with the Ladder Unit. There he learns how to use the various ladders and climbing devices, such millenniums-old equipment as ax, claw and hook as well as such modern equipment as electric saw, drill and acetylene torch. The third two weeks he spends with the Engine Unit and learns how to handle hoses, and so forth. The final two weeks summarize the course as well as providing experience in simulated and actual fire and smoke situations. If he passes the examination at the end of this term he is assigned to a fire company to complete his probationary period. If he is found satisfactory by his superiors he becomes a permanent member of the city’s fire department, beginning at Fourth Grade, automatically advancing one grade each year until the first, with each increase enjoying also an increase in salary.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Modern Aids</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The public press keeps on reporting on the valor of the fire fighters. It would seem that out of sheer appreciation, if not also from economic considerations, they would also be given the full benefit of modem inventions. But not so. It appears to be the exception rather than the rule, at least as far as the United States is concerned. This is particularly true as regards the use of “fog,” “wet water,” “wet water fog,” and “foam fog.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By &quot;fog” is meant a stream of water broken up by a certain type of nozzle so that it becomes like a cloud of coarse mist. This is a solid cloud of mist and not the umbrellalike spray of a garden hose. With such a nozzle much can be done with comparatively little water, as it gently settles on the fire instead of running off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As for “wet water,” this is ordinary water to which a certain chemical has been added, making it “wetter.” This decreases the surface tension of the water so that it penetrates rather than running off. A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duck </span><span class="font1">cannot swim for long in wet water; it soon becomes as waterlogged as a chicken in water. When the fog method is applied to ' wet water it becomes especially effective, in fact, from seven to ten times that of ordinary water. And a tank containing from 500 to 1,000 gallons of such “wet water” applied with fog nozzles is adequate for 99 percent of the fires that the average city fire department has to cope with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More than that, it has been found that when “wet water fog” is applied to one room it not only puts out the flames in that room but has a “remote control” or “indirect extinguishing action” on fires in adjoining rooms and floors; seemingly incredible, but nevertheless proved true time and again. Further, this &quot;wet water fog,” or any “fog,” can be applied from Ij-inch hoses instead of the regulation 2|-inch hoses. The smaller hose being preconnected, it is ready for use as soon as the fire truck </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reaches the fire</span><span class="font1">—a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">most important </span><span class="font1">consideration since &quot;all fires start small” and the “first five minutes are worth the next five hours.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Disaster on Your Doorstep,</span><span class="font1"> Paul W.

<p><span class="font1">For gasoline and other liquid fires there is a variation of this, the “fog foam,” produced by adding three gallons of a certain chemical to each 100 gallons of water. Crash trucks supplied with this solution are standard equipment at Idlewild, La Guardia and such airports. And another modem device not supplied nearly as much as it should be to the valiant fire fighters is the gas or smoke mask. As has well been observed, it makes as much sense to send firemen into smoke-filled houses without gas masks as it would to send them to a fire barefooted! The Miami fire department </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">has a mask for each</span><span class="font1"> fire fighter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">and for</span><span class="font1"> years has not had a single fireman overcome by smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Certainly the valiant fire fighters deserve all the help they can get from modem science in fighting fire, and it does seem unfortunate, yes, ununderstandable that this should be the exception rather than the rule. But perhaps that is expecting too much under present imperfect and selfish conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet there is co-operation that everyone can give. Take proper precautions to prevent fires. Keep electric wires and fixtures in good repair; do not be careless with matches; when you light a fire, watch it and keep it under control. Any fire fighter will agree that a little prevention on your part is worth more than all the protection that he can give.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bp &quot;Awake!” correepondent in Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">ELEVISION has come to Central Africa! Last November thousands of Rhodesians throughout Salisbury saw the prime minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Ny-asaland, Sir Roy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Welensky, inaugurate the new television service. “As you can imagine, this is quite a pleasure to me,” he said, “and a very considerable one to be speaking to you from the first television station to be established in the Federation, and I share with you that pride we feel on this occasion. There are not many countries as young as ours which can include television amongst the facilities they offer the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was Sir Roy Welensky who, in 1954, as Federal Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, had steered a bill through the Federal Parliament that opened the way for a possible television service. On that occasion, referring to the inclusion of a provision for television in the act, he said: “This may be thought to some to be unduly optimistic. But I hope my claim that it is merely farsighted will be justified in time.” And so it proved to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Radio broadcasting in the Central African territories had been a local affair until the forming of the Federation in September, 1953, but from then on the Federal government gradually undertook the responsibilities of operating the service, setting up a Commission of Inquiry in 1955 to consider the possibilities of a central broadcasting control. This resulted in the establishing of the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the responsibility for radio broadcasting in the Central African territories in February, 1958. Matters concerning television now moved on apace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first official announcement</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of government approval came in May, 1959, when the FBC invit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ed applications from persons who wished to be associated with the Corporation in the operation of a television service. It was intended that the service would follow the lines of the arrangement in Great Britain, where the government-established Independent Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Authority leases time to private “programme contractors” who obtain their revenue by selling advertising. The FBC would in a similar manner lease time to the successful contractor, but would act in a controlling and advisory capacity. The contractor would be required to advance the initial cost of erecting transmitting stations, but ownership would be vested in the FBC, which would also have control over the programs to ensure that high standards and good taste were maintained. As in Britain, the service would be commercial, to provide revenue for the contractor. One important condition was that the contractor would be willing to extend television coverage to the Federation’s main centers of population within a reasonable time. Television in Central Africa was on its way.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>SHixed Reception of Announcements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Now that television was a certainty, public reaction was immediate and interesting. How would television affect the traditional pattern of life in the Rhodesias, with its accent on family associations, hospitality to friends and strangers alike, its love of the great outdoors and the numerous sporting events carried on the year round due to the ideal weather conditions? How would it affect the rising generation of future Rhodesians? Would it retard or add to the present increasing divorce rate in the Federation—the third highest in the world? And of still greater import to those concerned with the multiracial aspect, how would it affect the African peoples who form the vast majority of the population in Central Africa?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A newspaper comment summarized what must have been the thought in the minds of many at the time: “In all quarters it is accepted that TV can be a great boon. But there is widespread conviction that television must come to the Federation only with the adequate safeguards against the abuses which have accompanied it in some other countries.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Sunday Mail)</span><span class="font1"> The article went on to quote expressions from a cross section of the population on the possible effects of television on Rhodesian life. Varied opinions came from some of those responsible for the education of Rhodesian youth. The hope that it would widen the viewpoint of Rhodesian children was expressed by a senior official of the Federal Ministry of Education who said: “In our schools TV will be a wonderful thing.'TV will give our children a window to the world. It is needed here more than in any country I can think of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An adviser on technical education to the Southern Rhodesia Government was quoted as saying that while he recognized the great aid that television would be to widening and stimulating the minds of the youngsters of the Rhodesias, who were rather shut off from the world at large, he also added: “I don’t want their imaginations stimulated as television is stimulating American youngsters. There, as I have seen, television is a menace to social life. We don’t want that here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The impact that television would have on the multiracial situation prompted further views. A spokesman of the Southern Rhodesia Department of Native Affairs observed: “The influence of television on Africans with their unsophisticated minds and emotional natures is going to be tremendous. Who can tell what effect it will have? The impact will be all the more powerful because of the novelty and the magic of the medium to the African mind.” On the other hand a more optimistic view was expressed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Standard: </span><span class="font1">“Television can bring great blessings. . . . Nothing could more quickly spread education and enlightenment among the backward majority of our people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some even thought it might help the divorce situation. The October 25, 1958, issue of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mail</span><span class="font1"> carried an article entitled “T.V. Is the Antidote to a Marriage Killer.” Drawing attention to the unenviable position that the Federation holds in the world divorce stakes, the article quoted authorities as pinpointing the cause to be boredom. “Foolish wives. Tired husbands. Meaningless sundowners. Flaccid conversation. Lots of acquaintances and few friends. Work hard all day and then what to do?” Hence the heavy drinking, family rows and broken homes. It went on to quote an English housewife from the Nuffield Foundation report on “Television and the Child” as saying: “Television holds us together. Before we had television it was very difficult to keep my husband contented. Television keeps husbands at home.” Would it have the same effect on Rhodesian homes? Time alone would tell.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Contract Is Placed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The FBC’s invitation attracted competitive applications from some of the world’s most influential television interests. Commenting on this, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Standard </span><span class="font1">said: “That some of the financially strongest and technically most experienced television operators in the world should have applied to run the Federation’s television services is most encouraging.” Careful consideration was given to the proposals submitted and it was not until September, 1959, that the successful contractors, Rhodesia TeleVision Ltd., were awarded a fifteen-year contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The contract provided for television services to begin in Salisbury, the capital city of the Federation, as soon as possible, and then to be extended to Bulawayo in the south and Kitwe, on the Copperbelt, in the north. The international transmission system was to be used with a definition of 625 lines to a picture. This would provide a much higher quality picture than in Britain (405 lines) or in the United States (525 lines). Programs would be for four hours in the evenings to begin with, while the FBC would remain as watchdog over news broadcasts to see that news was impartial and unbiased. Most of the programs would come from overseas, but provision was made in the contract for a definite percentage of local talent to be used. Time would be made available for any school or other noncommercial programs that the FBC would want to initiate. At this stage it was estimated that the limit of reception would be fifty-five miles from the station, enough to cover the heavily populated areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The boom was now on. Sales of radios had been lagging during the protracted negotiations, but now all dealers reported enquiries and advance orders for television sets. The scramble for the limited advertising time began, with South African manufacturers taking the lead. An FBC survey revealed that approximately 8,000 homes would be wanting television sets to start with, and it was estimated that 50,000 sets would be needed in the first five years. Salisbury’s leading hotels announced plans to include TV sets in bedrooms. By the opening night 3,000 sets had been sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The public were given an opportunity to have a financial interest in their own television services through a £400,000 ($1,120,000) issue of two-shilling nonvoting shares; holdings to range from a minimum of £10 ($28.00) to a maximum of £5,000 ($14,000). The list opened on June 15, 1960—closing almost at once oversubscribed more than thirteen times! A ballot was necessary to assign the shares. When dealings in the shares began later they rocketed to seven shillings ($.98) a share! Rhodesians seemed confident that television was coming to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Work pushed ahead on what was to be one of the most modernly equipped television stations in the world. Successful tests were made late in August, 1960, and regular fixed transmissions for testing purposes began in October. On November 14, the opening night, an estimated 40,000 Rhodesians saw the Federation’s prime minister, Sir Roy Welensky, inaugurate their own television service. Television had come to Central Africa!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Reactions and Early Results</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">During the week following the first telecast, reports started to pour in of good reception in towns from eighty to a hundred miles from Salisbury. Aerial masts thirty-five to sixty-five feet in height aided in this; some enthusiasts even reported receiving faint pictures from telecasts in Italy and Greece! Later, news came of a fairly clear picture being received at Vila Pery, a town in Mozambique over two hundred miles distant from the Salisbury transmitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the next few weeks Rhodesians spent their evenings either in front of their own sets, or in front of the sets of their friends. Everyone was anxious to experience what to the vast majority was something new. As the programs became familiar there were the inevitable bouquets and brickbats, but television had caught on and the rush for television sets continued. Local entertainment was immediately affected. Hotels that used to put on a cinema show for their patrons after supper reported a sharp falling off in attendances. Reviewing the situation six weeks after the first telecast, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Standard</span><span class="font1"> commented: “Already in many homes TV has become a habit. . . . That may or may not be a good thing. But we are convinced that more people are spending more time at home of an evening than was the case two months ago.” This was confirmed when members of the City Council were informed at a meeting in January, 1961, that cinema takings had dropped since the advent of television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With local entertainment limited and tending to be expensive, Rhodesians in the past had certainly been strong in their support of lending libraries, but even these have suffered. Said the owner of one such library that has carried on a successful business for twelve years: “Our business has been so badly hit by TV that we’re seriously thinking of closing down. People who used to read five or more books a week now only take perhaps one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the beginning educational authorities have been alert to the possibilities of using television in schools, and it was reported in the press that television for European, Asian, Coloured and African schools was scheduled for June, 1961. About twenty-five programs, each lasting twenty minutes, would be televised each term. Schools outside the present television area would receive films for screening with ordinary projectors. With arrangements well in hand for expanding service, it was hoped that television would be available in Bulawayo by June, 1961, and in Kitwe by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Coming at a time when the Federation is being profoundly affected by the political unrest within and without its borders, a report in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodesia Herald</span><span class="font1"> a short while after the beginning of the nightly telecasts is of interest: “Every night for the past two weeks crowds of good-humoured Africans have been enjoying themselves in the Highfield cocktail lounge —watching television. Once in front of the sets they are not interested in politics, constitutional reviews or anything else . . . would be trouble-makers are finding the TV is one of the most powerful forces they have ever been up against.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just as the coming of television has affected the lives, homes, habits and thinking of people in every country of the world where it is established, so it is bound to have a profound effect on the traditional pattern of life in the Rhodesias, and will be an immense factor in influencing public opinion. To what extent it will be for good or bad the future alone will tell. As the director-general of the FBC himself put it: “TV is something not good or bad in itself; it is the use we make of it that matters.” Yes, television has come to Central Africa, and it has come to stay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">an honest fear or some anxiety about travel by air? If so, this is not at all unusual. The fact is that almost all the mil</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">lions of passengers flown on airliners show signs of anxiety or fear in one way or another while in the air. Being quite new to mankind, considering how long the horse, cart and boat have been with us, air travel poses the problem of how to get people accustomed to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But some persons do not care to get accustomed to it. One report shows that about 70 percent of the people in the United States have never ridden in a commercial airliner. Economics and mere preference are big factors, no doubt, yet there must be a large percentage of persons who simply will not go by air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is the attitude of these persons? Some say: ‘Planes crash; I read about it in the newspapers.’ Others say, in effect: ‘What if there is less chance of an airplane accident than there is of an auto accident? Yet when there is an airplane accident, what chance have I got? Many persons walk away from auto accidents, but how many walk away from airplane accidents?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Actually more persons walk away from airplane accidents than is commonly supposed. When a Mexican airlines DC-8 jet crashed in an aborted take-off at New York’s Idlewild airport, all 102 of the passengers escaped before the plane burst into of 1959, 103 passenger airliners were involved in serious accidents in the United States. In forty of these accidents all the passengers were killed, but twenty-five of the accidents were listed as partially survivable, that is, not all the passengers were killed. In thirty-eight of them, there were no fatalities. The crashes that were 100-percent fatal were the high-speed variety, such as crashing into mountains or colliding with another plane in mid-air.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Bow Safe?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">“Few passengers are aware of the extent of the airlines’ safety program,” says Robert J. Serling in his book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Probable Cause.</span><span class="font1"> “If you attempted to maintain your family automobile so it would operate as efficiently and safely as an airliner, you would have to: 1. Check the car visually after every time you drive it, even around the block, for any outward sign of wear. 2. Clean spark plugs, check ignition systems and tires after every 750 miles of driving. 3. Overhaul the engine after every 20,000 miles. 4. Take the car completely apart after 50,000 miles. . . . That is what the airlines do with every plane they operate. . . . After every landing, planes are inspected visually with particular attention paid to any complaints by crew on unusual handling or performance. . . . After 800 hours of air time, engines are pulled, replaced and sent to shops for complete overhauls. (The newer jet engines, far simpler and more reliable, can go 2,000 hours and more before overhaul.)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The result is a phenomenally low accident rate. Looking at it one way, about 1,500,000 individual scheduled flights take off in the United States each year. In 1959, a year when there were considerably more accidents than usual, nine fatal accidents occurred. That was one fatal accident for about every 160,000 flights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With all the safety precautions taken, why is it that airplanes still crash? “After thirty-six years as a pilot and two years as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency,” says General E. R. Quesada, “I believe I can name the principal cause. It is that aspect of mankind called human frailty, a trait shared by pilots, airline executives, maintenance crews, members of the public and yours truly.” General Quesada believes that between 50 and 52 percent of air accidents are attributable to human error; about 25 percent due to maintenance error, about 8 percent due to weather turbulence and about 18 percent to failure of aircraft parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In an imperfect world there will always be accidents, but this accident rate for commercial airliners has long been remarkably low compared to that of automobiles. It is reported as a statistical fact that one is twenty times safer in a commercial airliner than in an automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About 600 persons were killed in 1958 in commercial airplane disasters worldwide. How does this compare with automobile travel? In the United States alone, almost 40,000 persons (usually 37,000 to 38,000) are killed each year in automobile accidents. If the newspapers reported these accidents with the sensationalism given airplane accidents, with front-page headlines and pictures, and so forth, many thousands of persons might well be more fearful of auto travel than air travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And what about Europe? Each year road accidents there take about 60,000 lives, about half the deaths being cyclists and motorcyclists. Yes, more persons are killed riding bicycles than in airliners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From 1949 through 1958, about 1,300 persons died in crashes of United States scheduled airliners. Yet in that same period, in the same country, auto accidents claimed the lives of 427,992 persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is seldom realized that blood transfusions in one year kill about as many persons as die in a decade of airplane accidents. The fatality rate, which covers only those deaths that are admitted to be caused by transfusions, is ahout one death in each thousand transfusions, or 5,000 deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the last five years both the speed and the passenger capacity of big airliners have nearly doubled. The number of passengers has increased by over 40 percent, and the number of passenger miles is up by about 70 percent. With increased speeds, there is not much margin for error in the sky; and the increased business has made the sky more and more crowded. Yet there are proportionately fewer air crashes today with ten times as many flights than there were ten years ago!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The increased business and increased speeds have brought to the fore the problem of mid-air collisions. The mid-air collision of two airliners, one a jet, over New York city on December 16, 1960, was the worst crash in United States aviation history; it cost the lives of 134 persons. The pilot of the jet apparently did not know his position, having overshot the point he was supposed to circle. Last year in the United States 50 airplanes (mostly private) flew into each other, and there were 324 near-misses reported by airliners. All this has resulted in a major governmental air safety drive, and about 90 percent of the Federal Aviation Agency's budget of $62 million has been directed toward solving the problem of mid-air collision.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Safety Progress Not Sensationalized</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The progress being made toward greater safety in air travel is not brought to the public’s attention in the sensational way in which airplane accidents are reported. Though enough is learned from virtually any accident to make a similar one harder to occur, the facts regarding solutions and corrections appear mainly in aviation journals. “In my opinion,” says a noted crash prober for the Civil Aeronautics Board, “the ‘fix* is the most dramatic part of the story and deserves to be accorded as much attention as the accident. Because it has not, I believe the public has never fully appreciated the remarkable improvement in aviation safety over the last twenty years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the matter of safety in air travel is well summarized by the Administrator of the F.A.A., Najeeb E. Halaby, who recently said: “We have to do whatever is necessary with whatever we have to prevent accidents. But no man can prove that the risks will not increase. I don’t know where a human being is ‘perfectly safe.’ One of the most dangerous places on the planet, as I understand it, is standing in a bathtub. If you slip, a bathtub is very unyielding. I don’t feel particularly safe crossing Fifth Avenue at 57th Street in New York, or on the Los Angeles Freeway. Where is man safe? I say that I feel safe enough in the air to fly constantly myself and have my wife and children fly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The jet age has not only brought about increased speed in air travel but remarkably trouble-free engines. On one airline the jet engines were found to be nine times more trouble-free than its most proved piston engine. Another report shows that the jet engines have functioned with only one tenth the in-flight shutdowns encountered on piston-engine planes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Jet Age: Stage 11</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">A new development in travel by air is the jet-fan engine. What does this mean for air travel? C. R. Smith, president of American Airlines, called the jet-fan development “stage two” of the jet age and said that it is the most important forward step in air transport since the jet entered service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is the jet fan? The conventional jet engine achieves thrust by momentum of air passing through the three sections of the engine. In the jet fan, the propulsion derives from two separate streams of air. One passes through the regular channel of compressor, burner and turbine. The other goes only through large, many-bladed fans before being exhausted. Describing the jet fan, William A. Patterson, president of United Airlines, says: “The addition of this fan to the presentday jet engine can be described in terms as a cross between the turbo prop engine and the pure jet power plant. The fan practically fills the role now being accomplished by the propeller and piston engine aircraft.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The benefits of jet-fan engines are several. One is fuel economy. Smaller fuel loads will make way for larger payloads. Another benefit is greater cruising speed: about 640 miles per hour. The slower exhaust means reduced noise. One benefit of the turbofan is related to the matter of increased safety on take-offs; for the new turbofan permits a faster climb, and a quicker take-off means far less runway is required than for the best of the standard jets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the new-type aircraft on the horizon is the British-built Vickers Super VC-10, a jet liner that will carry up to 212 persons plus four tons of freight nonstop across the Atlantic. An unusual aspect of this British jet liner is its new look: It has clean wings and rear-mounted engines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another new type of plane is being built by Douglas Aircraft Company; this is the DC-8F, a half cargo, half passenger plane, powered by turbofan engines. The DC-8F, Douglas says, will make possible lower rates for both freight and passengers.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Plea for Lower Rates</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Lower rates are indeed what the public has been waiting for, especially in regard to transocean travel. That international air fares are unreasonably high is demonstrated when domestic fares for equivalent distances are compared. Why the higher rates for transocean travel? The most significant factor seems to be the rate-making activities of the International Air Transport Association. The prices are fixed by this organization. American airlines may participate in the I.A.T.A. rate machinery because the government thus far has exempted these activities from the United States antitrust laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few years ago, during the eightyfourth Congress of the United States, the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigated the airlines industry. The subcommittee concluded: “The committee believes the time to restore competitive conditions to the international air transport industry is long overdue. Accordingly, the committee believes the board should re-examine its approval of the I.A.T.A. rate conference mechanism. Our national antitrust policy demands that the interest of the traveling public of the United States and of the world no longer should continue to be subjected to the force of ‘an all-embracing international cartel.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But thus far this &quot;all-embracing international cartel” tightly controls the fares that the major, scheduled airlines must charge for transocean travel. In 1955, over the objections of I.A.T.A., the Civil Aeronautics Board first authorized supplemental carriers and cargo carriers to undertake charter operations. The experience in charter operations disclosed the vast market that is waiting to be tapped when the international fare structure is sufficiently reduced. A recent issue of the New York Times reported that the Flying Tiger Line had announced that it would soon begin a 899 round-trip fare to the United States east coast on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chartered</span><span class="font1"> flights </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">originating in Europe,</span><span class="font1"> enabling them to fill planes that might otherwise return empty to the United States. The 899 round-trip rate compares with a $250-8300 fare on charters from New York to Europe and with a $450 New York-to-London fare for economy class tickets on piston airliners of major scheduled airlines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What might be called “Jet Age: Stage III” is being discussed these days; this is the development of a supersonic airliner. The Lockheed version of the supersonic plane is needle-nosed, with its wings in the rear, and would fly at about 2,000 miles per hour. “We can move into the supersonic transport,” says F.A.A. chief Halaby, &quot;toward the end of the 1960’s, which will enable us to fly from Los Angeles to New York in an hour and 45 minutes and from New York to London in two hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the supersonic airliner goes into operation, who knows but that many persons who prefer to stay on the ground now will change their minds—at least for those two hours or less across the ocean!</span></p>

This happened this winter in the Grisons, taking a toll of nine students and an instructor. Without warning and with a loud detonation, a solid sheet to the width of three hundred to four hundred yards cracked and began to slide over the flank of the sparsely wooded alp, burying the surprised skiers from fifteen to twenty feet deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Spring sees more avalanches than slides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">beautiful mountains can also be arrogant and cruel. They are incalculable in both summer and winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Swiss people have a strong sense of responsibility toward their neighbors, especially in the mountainous areas, where they face the rigors of winter and the changing moods of these unpredictable monsters. Everything humanly possible is being done to avoid casualties. The Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, together with the Meteorological Society, gives regular reports as to weather conditions, nature of the snow and where there is danger of avalanches. Yet almost daily in early spring we hear reports similar to this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Two people buried beneath avalanche outside of the marked route. Rescue guard with trained avalanche dogs and resuscitation equipment immediately at the site of the disaster.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When loads of fresh snow fall onto a The thawing snow begins to roll, growing in size and momentum, carrying all with it in its mad rush to the valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great progress has been made in all rescue organizations since the tremendous snow slides of 1951, with so many casualties. In the last few years the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rettungs-Flugwacht</span><span class="font1"> (Air Rescue Service) has begun ever more to strike the ears of radio listeners. The Swiss Air Rescue Service (SARS) is a purely private Swiss humanitarian institution. It works in cooperation with and is at the disposal of other existing rescue organizations. On March 19, 1960, it became an independent Society; and up to March 19, 1961, 160 lives had been saved and 30 dead recovered.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Purpose and Personnel</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Its purpose is to render rapid assistance in emergencies where it is necessary to bring medical aid, rescue teams, materials and medicaments to the site of the accident or to transport sick and injured. Both in summer and winter their help is most frequently called upon in the mountains where other modes of travel are slow and hazardous. This air rescue service has become almost indispensable to the scattered and isolated mountain inhabitants, especially in cases of births and accidents, and to the workers on the dams of the hydroelectric power stations at high altitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Air Rescue Service also goes into operation in response to calls from abroad. Many persons may recall the now historic operation in collaboration with the United States Air Force in the Grand Canyon, in July, 1956, after the crash of a Super Constellation and a DC-6, with a total of 128 passengers, over the Colorado River.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 133 active members in the organization are highly qualified voluntary workers, giving freely of their time and strength at the risk of their own lives in the pursuit of an idealism, that of lifesaving. There are sixty pilots in all, of which thirty are trained glacier men, twelve expert parachutists, twenty high-alpine rescue men, seven anesthetists; doctors, certified mountain guides and avalanche and ambulance dog handlers are also on the staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has thirty-two machines at its disposal, including helicopters, seaplanes and single- and twin-engined planes equipped with landing skis. Some are specially equipped with containers fitted to the fuselage for dropping avalanche dogs by parachute and the release mechanism for dropping provisions by parachute, or with special gear for mass jumping by parachutists.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The Avalanche Dog</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps one of the most fascinating angles of this rescue work is the service of the trained avalanche or ambulance dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These faithful creatures are untiring in their efforts to find the victim and rescue him from a white grave. The avalanche dogs are particularly tested as to resistance to airsickness and generally go into action by helicopter or by separate parachute drop with the handler. The dogs are released from containers with parachutes with a very low rate of drop. The parachute is automatically released from the dog on landing (thus preventing dragging in the wind), and at the same time the carrying straps arc automatically unfastened so that the dog is freed, ready for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The aid of the avalanche dog to man is invaluable. The perfect unison between master and his dog is proverbial. Responding with tenacious concentration to the plea, “Seek, Boy. Seek!’’ he sniffs over the deep snow, using his strong sense of smell to find the buried victim. Seconds count! With short yaps of excitement, he arrests the attention of his master as he begins to paw frantically. His master is quickly at his side with more effective tools; and so with the combined energy of man, dog and machine, an untimely death in the Alps is defeated. Of rescue operations in a recent great avalanche disaster it was stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“An essential part in this rescue work was the assistance rendered by the Swiss Air Rescue Service with their helicopters for the transport of rescue equipment and the injured. Five dogs were brought to the site of the catastrophe ... all worked tirelessly till past midnight to recover the last victim of this death-dealing avalanche.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Call-out and Expense</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Four call-out lines have been established with uninterrupted picket service at strategic points to ensure rapid penetration into the alpine wall. Now by dialing “Enquiries” (No. 11) you are immediately put through to the alarm center in Kloten airport tower, from which you are then connected with the call-out control. In rapid succession the caller is required to answer several questions, such as: What happened? When? Where? Who are injured? What is the weather in the region of the accident?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The call-out leader now gets in touch with the meteorological service, and with the appropriate picket line or pilot whose services are required. The pilot alone decides whether aircraft should go into action. The group leader decides whether parachutists should be dropped over the scene of the disaster. He can only forbid jumping, never order it, for these men are voluntary workers and often their own lives are at stake. It takes only from two to five minutes at the longest from alarm to readiness for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All rescue operations carried out are free for persons of small or modest means. An operation is not dependent upon the ability of the rescued persons to pay. No wages are paid. A bill is made out for actual costs incurred. The sum of SFrs. 180,000 (about $42,000) has been mentioned as total expenses to be covered by the Society in one year. It is maintained on a purely private basis by the active and inactive members, supported by voluntary contributions from alpine clubs, automobile and touring clubs, air companies, as well as insurance and other companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The efforts and extremes of personal sacrifice to which these men are ready to go in the pursuance of their purpose are truly admirable. Little is ever asked as to the motive of the persons involved in an accident, when pitting their puny power against the moods of these unre-lentless mountains, endangering the lives of courageous rescue men. Some persons have perished by taking unnecessary and foolhardy risks. But man has been endowed with reason and sound judgment, and it is rightly expected that he use the spirit of a sound mind in all his undertakings: “For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.”—2 Tim. 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True Christians demonstrate not only soundness of mind in whatever they do, but courage in carrying out the greatest lifesaving project of all times—warning men everywhere of this world’s impending Armageddon disaster. By sounding the alarm of Armageddon and by preaching the good news of God’s kingdom earthwide, Jehovah’s witnesses are aiding threatened mankind to flee to the place of safety. It takes time and effort and money, but all this is freely contributed, not only for humanitarian reasons, but that the will of Jehovah God may be carried out, “because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance,” that they may prove worthy of everlasting life in a world wherein death will have been defeated forever. “As the last enemy, death is to be destroyed.” —2 Pet. 3:9; 1 Cor. 15:26.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Working at That for Which We Pray</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">T</span><span class="font1">IE Word of God has much to say about prayer. It tells us to whom we must pray if we would have our prayers heard and answered—to Jehovah God alone. It teaches us how to pray—in faith, with sincerity and humility, and in the name of Jesus Christ. And it instructs us as to what we can pray for—everything that is in line with God’s will, in particular for spiritual blessings and the triumph of righteousness.—Ps. 65:1, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2;</span><span class="font1"> Prov. 15:29; Matt 6: 9-13; John 16:23, 24; Jas. 1:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Without doubt Adam and Eve communed with God when in the garden of Eden. And so did Abel, outside the garden; his very offering being in effect a prayer. In that Enoch and Noah “walked with the God,” we must conclude that they also talked with God. Abram's observation to God about not having a son was an implied prayer; certainly his pleading with Jehovah to spare the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, if but ten righteous persons were found in them, was a mighty prayer of faith: “Is the Judge of all the earth not going to do what is right?”—Gen. 5:24; 6:9; 15:3;18:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to the Scriptural record, among those servants of God in whose lives prayer figured very prominently were Moses, King David, Daniel, Jesus Christ the Son of God, and the apostle Paul. Throughout their lives they appreciated the value of prayer, setting a good example for Christians today. Most fitting, therefore, are the apostolic injunctions: “Persevere in prayer.” “Pray incessantly.” “Be vigilant with a view to prayers.” —Rom. 12:12; 1 Thess. 5:17; 1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, as true as the foregoing is, we may never overlook the fact that if we would have our prayers answered we must also do our part: We must be working at what we pray for. There is no question about God as to doing his part; but are we always doing our part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, when Abram, in effect, prayed for a son and God assured him that he would receive one, did Ahram conclude that it was no use having relations with Sarah because they both were too old to have offspring? Had he, would Isaac ever have been born? When Jacob heard about his envious brother Esau coming to meet him with a large body of men, Jacob not only earnestly prayed to God for help, but he also sent a munificent gift on ahead of him to Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When David was hunted like a wild beast, he not only prayed to God to protect and deliver him, but he used the utmost care and strategy to avoid being trapped by murderous King Saul and hig men. And when later his son Absalom staged an insurrection against him as king and induced Ahithophel, the wisest counselor of the time, to join him, David not only prayed to God to foil Ahithophel’s counsel, but he dispatched Hushai to Absalom for that very purpose. Jehovah answered David’s prayer by means of Hushai, Absalom following Hushai’s counsel instead of Ahithophel’s.—2 Sam. 15:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Solomon, upon becoming king, petitioned God for wisdom and he received it But would Solomon have received this wisdom had he failed to heed the instructions in the law of Moses regarding kings’ making their own copy of the Pentateuch and reading in it all the days of their life? The facts answer No, for they show that when King Solomon went contrary to this instruction for kings he became most unwise and so died out of favor with God. —Deut. 17:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this regard we could not wish a better example than that of Jesus Christ. He not only told his followers to pray for God’s name to be sanctified, but he himself did all he could to have God’s name sanctified in the minds and hearts of his listeners. (John 17:4, 6) Note also the time he said to his disciples: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Did Jesus let matters rest with only praying? Not at all! Rather, right after saying these words he sent out the twelve in two's, so that then there were six pairs of preachers instead of only one band of thirteen. Later he sent out seventy evangelists or missionaries, also in two’s, making at least thirty-six separate teams of itinerant preachers of the good news of God’s kingdom.—Luke 10:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The apostle Paul also set a noteworthy example for us by working at what he prayed for. He not only repeatedly states in his letters that he prayed for his brothers that they might progress to spiritual maturity, but he himself did all he possibly could to help them to attain it. Wherever he could he gave individual personal help; he also set a fine example in maturity, and further, both by the spoken and the written word, he admonished his brothers so that they might “all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.”—Eph. 1:15-19; 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, we cannot escape it. We must work at what we pray for. Consistent efforts must accompany our prayers. We pray for our bread for this day, but at the same time must acknowledge, by our actions, the rule that &quot;if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.” (2 Thess. 3:10) Jesus told us to pray for God’s holy spirit. To have that prayer answered we must work at receiving the holy spirit by study of God’s Word, by prayer, by association with his people, by exercising self-control and by sharing in the Christian ministry. (Luke 11:13) We further are told that if we, lack wisdom we should ask God for it. But here again, we will never receive it unless we work at it, putting forth consistent efforts.—Jas. 1:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do we pray for peaceable relations with our associates? Then we must also work at it, showing kindness and tact, being patient, slow to take offense. Do we pray for prosperity upon God’s work? Thereby we obligate ourselves to work, for if all those praying did not work at it there would be no prosperity. Do we pray for opportunities to magnify our God? Then we must go out of our way to look for and to make opportunities to speak about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In particular must we work at what we pray for in regard to overcoming our shortcomings or vices, be they laziness, overindulgence in food or drink, or carelessness in respect to the proprieties between the sexes. It will not do to keep confessing our faults to God each night and asking forgiveness if the next day we fail to put forth consistent efforts to overcome our weaknesses. We must work at them. Only “he that is confessing and leaving [his transgressions] will be shown mercy.” —Prov.28:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So, while appreciating the importance of prayer and knowing to whom to pray, how and what for, let us never overlook the fact that for our prayers to be heard we must do our part, working at that for which we pray.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">•$&gt; A little more than two years ago a sup erp a tri otic, flag-waving society was organized under the direction of retired businessman Robert Welch, Jr. It was named after John Birch, a young American who was killed by the Chinese Communists in 1945. Reminiscent of the tactics of Joe McCarthy, the society has cast numerous unfounded charges of “Communist” and “Communist supporter” on many individuals and groups, including former United States president Dwight D. Eisenhower, United States Chief Justice Earl Warren, United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold, as well as upon Jehovah’s witnesses. The New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font16"> Maya-</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">zine</span><span class="font16"> described the society and its work as “a semi-secret network of 'Americanists’ dedicated to fighting Communists by deliberately adopting some of communism’s own clandestine and ruthless tactics.&quot;</span></p>

The sale price of the grain was $362,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">F.B.I. Chief for 37 Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">May 10 was J. Edgar Hoover’s thirty-seventh anniversary as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hoover, who is now sixty-six years old, started in the Department of Justice in 1917. He became an assistant director of the old Bureau of investigation in 1921 and was made director May </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">10, </span><span class="font16">1924.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">&lt;$- Figures based on the 1960 census reveal that women outnumber the men in 39 of the 50 states in the United States. Alaska has the highest ratio of men to women, with 132.3 men for 100 women, and Massachusetts the lowest, wifh only 93.4 males per 100 females. The national ratio is 100 women to 97 men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">&lt;§&gt; On May 4 a U.S. Navy balloon soared 113,000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico to a new altitude record. After the flight had been successfully completed one of its two-man crew, Lieutenant Commander Victor Prather, was killed when he fell from a sling that had been lowered from a helicopter to pick him up. The flight broke the previous altitude record for an open-gondola balloon of 102,-S00 feet set last August by U.S. Air Force Captain Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Suicide Among Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;§• According to Dr. James M. Toolan, assistant professor of Clinical Psychiatry<sup>7</sup> at Bclle-vue-New York University College of Medicine, there is an alarming incidence of attempted suicide among youth. He said that in 1960, of 900 consecutive admissions to Bellevue psychiatric service of youth under seventeen years of age, 102 were attempted suicides. These ranged in age from five to seventeen years, with most of them being adolescent girls. Dr. Toolan said that the attempt at suicide seemed to result from a severe depressive state.</span></p>

He was assisted by a mechanic and a meteorologist. Rogozov was reported to be recovering and able to be up and around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost for Hospitalization</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A survey by the American Hospital Association covering 1960 revealed that the cost for basic hospital services average $15 to $20 a day in the United States. This charge covers room and board as well as routine nursing care and minor supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Presbyterian Theology</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On April 30 the Southern Presbyterian theological viewpoint on predestination was challenged and in effect rejected during the church’s General Assembly in Dallas, Texas. A resolution adopted by the Assembly stated that the complicated Presbyterian doctrine on predestination, which is based on a church creed written 313 years ago, “is not an adequate statement of Christian faith.&quot; Dr. James I. McCord, the president of Princeton Theological Seminary, told the Assembly that “we have not paid the price of developing a theology that is relevant to the problems of modem man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">More Male Teachers</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$■ It is reported that during the academic year 1958-59 men accounted for 52,2 percent of the teaching staff in the public high schools in the United States. According to the U.S. Office of Education, this was the first year since surveys began in 1890 that the men outnumbered the women teachers.</span></p>

The United States’ first astronaut, Alan B. Shepard, commented, “Boy, what a ride.” Shepard’s ride at 4,500 miles an hour in a 2,300-pound space capsule was admittedly modest compared to Gagarin’s 17,000-miles-an-hour circle of the earth in the 10,000-pound Soviet space ship.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">On May</span><span class="font16"> 9 the Indian parliament completed passage of a bill banning the practice of giving and accepting dowries, an age-old custom of giving or receiving property, money or valuables in consideration for marriage. The bill provides for a fine of 5,000 rupees ($1,050) or up to six months in prison or both for offenders. It was recognized that the law itself would not stop the dowry practice, but it was hoped that it would curb it and that eventually it would be eliminated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; During the first week in May statistics for 1961 were released by the publisher of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Official Catholic Directory. </span><span class="font16">They showed a total of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">42,104,-</span><span class="font16">899 Roman Catholics in the United States, making the country 24-percent Catholic. This is an increase of 47 percent and of 13,470,021 Catholics over ten years ago. Significantly, however, there was a drop in weddings in the church, number of conversions and infant baptisms. The United States has 5 cardinals, 30 archbishops, 185 bishops and 54,682 ordained priests. Baptists reported an 18-percent increase during the years 1951 to 1959, from 17,155,905 to 20,879,220, and the Methodists reportedly rose from 11,471,057 to 12,358,-861 for an 8-percent increase during the same period. These are the three largest religious denominations in the United States.</span></p>

But they will be very, very few.” “It is not enough to cater to the nation’s whims—you must also serve the nation’s needs,” he contended. The Federal Communications Commission would no longer automatically renew station licenses, Minow told the broadcasters,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Pain In the Neck</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">•$&gt; Dr. Charles Rob, professor of surgery, told a scientific meeting on April 17 that 25 percent of all paralytic strokes are caused by damage in one of four large arteries in the neck and not in the brain itself. He stated that the condition is easily diagnosed and the corrective operation is relatively simple. Dr. Rob himself performed the first of such operations in 1954, and the patient is still alive and doing very well at the age of 72. He said that in the last seven years there have been thousands of like operations performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Killer No. 3, Mr. Accident</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;*&gt; The United Nations World Health Organization reported in April that only cancer and heart diseases take more lives than accidents. The organization stated that more people between the ages of 1 and 44 are killed by accidents than by any single disease. In Canada nearly 2,000 children are killed by accidents every year. Home accidents are claiming more than half the total. So be careful with your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Famine In China</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">$&gt; A group of prominent Chinese in Hong Kong on April 17 issued an appeal to the people of the world in behalf of the people of Communist China. The appeal stated that China is experiencing the “most disastrous famine in 100 years.” The appeal called on people of the world to send food. Some 50,000 to 80,000 parcels of food are now mailed daily to the Communist China mainland. But the appeal said that that amount was “far from being adequate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking Shortens Life Span</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; Dr. Linus Pauling, 1954 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, told 1,300 University of Toronto students that to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day will probably cut as much as eight years off a man’s life and two packs a day will shorten his life as much as 18 years. Other authorities show that by smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, pregnant women may double their chances of having smaller or premature babies. Studies also show that fetal death rates were found to be more than twice as high among infants of cigarette smokers as for those of nonsmokers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Salt Can Be Poisonous</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; The body needs salt for its health, but an overdose can be dangerous, especially to children. Dr. Laurence Fin berg of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, reported that less than a tablespoon of salt can severely poison a healthy infant. Severe brain damage or even death may result. Although salt poisoning is not a common occurrence, there have been serious cases of the same.</span></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since <em>The Watchtower </em>takes the lead in ‘guarding freedom for doing God’s complete will,’ it should be in the homes of all lovers of true freedom. During April Jehovah’s witnesses will make it possible for all to have this magazine coming regularly to their homes, by offering a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and three Bible booklets, for $1.</p>

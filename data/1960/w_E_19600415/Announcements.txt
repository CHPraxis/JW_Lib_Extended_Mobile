FIELD MINISTRY
Since The Watchtower takes the lead in ‘guarding freedom for doing God’s complete will,’ it should be in the homes of all lovers of true freedom. During April Jehovah’s witnesses will make it possible for all to have this magazine coming regularly to their homes, by offering a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and three Bible booklets, for $1.
PEACE-PURSUING DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES
Arrangements for the 1960 district assemblies in the United States and Canada have now been completed. The assembly locations are listed below, along with the rooming headquarters address for each city. Each of the Peace-pursuing District Assemblies will be four days in duration, and all of Jehovah’s witnesses and others who are interested in peace will want to be present for the entire assembly. Beginning five weeks before the date of the assembly that you plan to attend, you may write to Watchtower Convention, at the rooming headquarters address, and they will be glad to assist you in obtaining rooming accommodations.

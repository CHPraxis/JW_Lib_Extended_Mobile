<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Christians are instructed to be ‘assembling still more as the day nears.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:25</a>) Not only will we continue to do so, but we will encourage others to see the importance of assembling with Jehovah’s people. To that end, we will offer to the people during July the fine book <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth” </em>and another helpful Bible-study book, with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

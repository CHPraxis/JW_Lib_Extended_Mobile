Announcements
FIELD MINISTRY
Christians are instructed to be ‘assembling still more as the day nears.’ (Heb. 10:25) Not only will we continue to do so, but we will encourage others to see the importance of assembling with Jehovah’s people. To that end, we will offer to the people during July the fine book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and another helpful Bible-study book, with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.
IS YOUR FUTURE HOPEFUL?
What will be the outcome of the present struggle for world control? What security measures are the most practical for the crisis that is certain to come, and what prospects for the future will the survivors have? What part can you have in these history-making events? Obtain and read the two fascinating and revealing books “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World. Both give you the Bible’s answers to these questions. Send $1 and receive free the booklets Healing of the Nations Has Drawn Near and “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

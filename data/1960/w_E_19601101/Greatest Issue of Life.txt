Greatest Issue of Life
 “The one and only real and profound theme of the world and of human history . . . is the conflict between belief and unbelief,” said Johann von Goethe. The apostle Paul recognized this issue of faith by saying: “Without faith it is impossible to win his good pleasure, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”—Heb. 11:6.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FAR though modern man has been able to reach out into space, he has not been able to reach the heavens where Jehovah God dwells. And although the more man learns about nature the more proof he has of God’s existence, with it all he no more sees God in his works than does a cow looking up into the sky. Such wisdom is most impractical. Why? Because not only has it filled the earth with strife, confusion and corruption, but it ignores the fact that only Jehovah God can give security now and at Armageddon.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Blindly men and nations fight over world domination. Ignoring God’s Word, they are in the dark to the fact that the question as to who will rule the world has long been settled. Jehovah God himself has given the administration of all things into the hands of his Son, Jesus Christ. Those who are wise will submit themselves to this powerful King and line up with his will.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:10-49:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 1:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As Jesus showed in one of his illustrations, when faced with superior forces the wise thing to do is to negotiate peace. Since Jesus Christ will soon act as Almighty God’s executioner, it is the course of wisdom for us to negotiate peace with God by dedicating ourselves to do his will. Having sued for peace, we must be willing to say good-by to all our belongings, if need be, and continue to pay the running expenses, as it were, of our dedication. Thereafter we must keep a strong, sharp, decided attitude toward it. If we let ourselves become weak, like salt that has lost its flavor, we would be unfit for God’s use.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:25-42:14:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 14:25-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Further illustrating the course of practical wisdom in a doomed world, Jesus told of an unjust steward who, when about to lose his position, made friends for himself by reducing the amounts his master’s debtors owed. His own master or lord, not the Lord Jesus, commended him for his shrewdness, his practical worldly wisdom. So we today, if we have practical wisdom, will make friends of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ with whatever unrighteous riches we have. Then when this old world goes down, these Friends will bring us into their everlasting dwelling places.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:1-42:16:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 16:1-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yes, as Jesus emphasized in his sermon on the mount, it is not enough merely to hear the good news of God’s kingdom and to believe it to be true. We must do something about it, act upon it. Only then shall we be like the wise man who built his house on a rock-mass. Our obedience to God’s righteous requirements will give us a firm foundation that will enable us to weather Armageddon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 7:24-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God’s righteous requirements at the present time relate primarily to making known his name and kingdom by preaching from house to house, on the streets, and whenever opportunity affords. We must be concerned about working efficiently by properly preparing ourselves. Then our tool, the Word of God, will be like a sharp ax, effective in accomplishing our purpose.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:10:10-21:10:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 10:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">So particularly during this month of November, let all exercise practical wisdom by urging others to sue for peace with God and by using all we have to make friends of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.</p>

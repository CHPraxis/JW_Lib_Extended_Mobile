FIELD MINISTRY
‘Pursuing peace in the love of life’ is our service theme for December. (1 Pet. 3:10, 11) Appropriately, in the field ministry we will offer the peace-promoting information contained in the books From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained and “Let God Be True,” with two booklets on Bible subjects, on a contribution of $1.25.
WHAT IS YOUR FUTURE?
Do you know what the next few years will bring? No man can know all things that will take place, but what the final outcome will be is no secret. That is because God’s Word contains the answer. Your future is a part of that answer. Find your place there. Read the two hard-bound books From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained and “New Heavens and a New Earth.” Send $1.25 now and receive free the two comforting and thought-provoking booklets Healing of the Nations Has Drawn Near and God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?

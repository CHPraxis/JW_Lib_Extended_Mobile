<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The 1950’s has been called the decade of disasters in America. As a result of disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and fires, etc., 29,000 homes were destroyed, while 600,000 more were damaged, making 1,600,000 persons homeless. No wonder the American Red Cross called the 1950’s the most disastrous decade in the nation’s history.</p>

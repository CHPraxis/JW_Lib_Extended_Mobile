<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> “Sometimes Christianity is presented in such a way that it looks as if it was the work of a gentle and loving Jesus to pacify a stern and angry God, as if Jesus did something which changed the attitude of God toward men. The New Testament knows nothing of that. The whole process of salvation began because God so loved the world.”—Barclay in <em>More New Testament Words.</em></p>

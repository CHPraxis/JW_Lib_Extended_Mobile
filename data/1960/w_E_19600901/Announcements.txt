FIELD MINISTRY
September will complete the three-month campaign during which Jehovah’s witnesses are offering to all persons who show interest in the Word of God the Bible-study book “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” along with another book and two booklets, for $1. Special effort should be made to reach those living in areas previously unworked during this campaign.
ANNUAL MEETING AT PITTSBURGH
On Saturday, October 1, 1960, at ten o’clock in the forenoon, the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania will be held at the Society’s office located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Notice of the annual meeting will be sent to all the members. So that the letters of notice will reach the members shortly after September 1, all should be certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses.
Proxies will accompany the notice of meeting. Each member should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not and should do so so that the proxies will reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15.
YOUR PART IN A NEW WORLD
“New heavens and a new earth!” That is one of the wonderful promises of the Bible. Do you know what it means? Its fulfillment will involve, in one way or another, every living creature. To be sure of your part, be informed! Send for and read the two hard-bound books “New Heavens and a New Earth” and “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” They total 768 pages of vital Bible instruction and counsel. Send $1 at once and receive free two timely booklets also.

“Church Depending on Lifts by the State”
 Under the heading quoted above writer Bo Stromstedt, in the Stockholm Expressen, January 6, 1959, concluded an article on the discussion as to whether State and Church ought to separate, as follows: “It cannot be helped; it certainly would make a cleaner look, and at the same time be the only proper thing from the viewpoint of the law about religious freedom, if the Church would once for all give up the thought of getting lifts by the State’s old horse and would instead dare to embark ‘alone in fragile vessel’, as all other denominations must do. With the fare paid all by herself.”

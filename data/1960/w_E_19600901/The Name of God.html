<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In their Tract No. 12, published in La Paz, Bolivia, the Maryknoll priests inadvertently admitted that the name of God is Jehovah. Catholic translations make the name Jehovah conspicuous by its absence, but here is the quotation from the Catholic tract:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“This precept [the 2nd commandment] commands us not to abuse the name of God. The Jews of the Old Testament had so much respect for the name of God that they began to avoid the pronouncing of this name. In the book of Leviticus we read, ‘Whosoever curses the name of Jehovah will be punished with death’. Then the punishment of ‘taking the name of God in vain’ was death. For that reason, Moses commanded that the blasphemers, who take the name of God in vain, be stoned to death by the people.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Does the Bible version you use contain the name of God? His name does appear in the original Hebrew Scriptures over 6,800 times.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Having been told, while preaching from house to house, that the Patrician Society of the local Roman Catholic Church was to have a lecture on Jehovah’s witnesses at its monthly meeting, a number of the Witnesses decided to attend. The priest, however, became so alarmed he would permit only four of them to remain.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After an obviously abridged and somewhat mild talk lasting only ten minutes the meeting was opened to discussion, questions to be addressed to the chairman, but they could be answered by anyone in the audience. One of the first questions a Catholic lady asked was: “Why do Jehovah’s witnesses go from door to door?” The chairman looked at the guest speaker, the speaker in turn at the presiding priest, and the priest looked—lost. One of the Witnesses present took this opportunity to ask for permission to answer the question, which was gladly granted.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From then on questions came thick and fast from the many Catholics present, and they were answered tactfully and truthfully by the Witnesses, quoting many scriptures. For some two hours an excellent witness was given about Jehovah and his purposes, his kingdom, his visible organization and the new earth. Interest and manifest good will were so great that the local priest found it expedient to declare the meeting closed, with some eager Catholic questions still unanswered. Judging by the comments passed, this was one of the most stimulating and interesting evenings ever held by the Patrician Society—the meeting about Jehovah’s witnesses that turned out to be a meeting by the Witnesses!—Australia.</p>

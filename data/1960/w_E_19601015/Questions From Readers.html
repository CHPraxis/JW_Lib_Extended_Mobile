<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is meant by ‘looking at the liver,’ as mentioned at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:21-26:21:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 21:21</strong></a> <strong>(<em>RS</em>)?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:21-26:21:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:21</a> we read regarding Nebuchadnezzar: “For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver.” (<em>RS</em>) This practice of looking at or inspecting the liver in quest of omens, known as hepatoscopy, was based on the ancient idea that the liver was the center of all vitality, activity, emotion and affection. It doubtless was given this prominence because of its bloody nature, in man one sixth of the blood being found in the liver.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In ancient Assyria the name of the priests was <em>baru, </em>meaning “inspector,” because of the prominence that inspecting the liver played in the life of a priest. The liver being a very diverse organ, consisting of lobes, ducts, appendages, and having veins, ridges and other markings, allowed for the widest variety of interpretations. If, for example, a certain depression was unusually long, it was said to presage a long reign for the king. If there was a reversal in the comparative size of certain parts, this was taken to mean that there would be a reversal, such as that a servant would rule over his master. Then again, if a certain mark or characteristic was on the right side it was considered a favorable omen, if on the left, an unfavorable one. Precedent also played a role. Thus, if a certain condition in the liver was followed by a favorable turn of events, it was believed that a like condition in a newly slaughtered animal would presage a like favorable turn of events. Hepatoscopy was initially practiced or featured by the Assyrians and Babylonians, and later adopted by the Greeks and Romans. In modern times vestiges of it are found in certain primitive lands of Africa and Asia.</p>

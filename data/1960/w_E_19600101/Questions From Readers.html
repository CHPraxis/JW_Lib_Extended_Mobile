<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of the illustration appearing on page 220 of the book <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth”?</em>—B. T., U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This picture illustrates the theme of chapter ten, The North Against the South. The South is pictured by the pyramids, which are associated with and stand for Egypt, the king of the South. The North is pictured by a Syrian shepherd, as Syrians were great sheep herders and Syria played the part of the king of the North.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>● In the <em>New World Translation </em>of the Hebrew Scriptures “Jehovah” is listed as YHWH. Should it not be YHVH?—B. Y., U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is rendered this way in the <em>New World Translation, </em>instead of “Y H V H,” because the Jewish letter, the third one in the name, is pronounced like a “W” instead of like a “V.” This fact is shown up in that some translators render the divine name into English as “Yahweh” instead of “Jahveh.”</p>

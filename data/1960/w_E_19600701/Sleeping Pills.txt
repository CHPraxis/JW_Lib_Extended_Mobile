Sleeping Pills
 In his pastoral letter to the clergy of his diocese the new bishop of Lund, Nils Bolander, asks the question why so relatively few people enter in through the gates of the churches? And he himself gives this answer: “The foremost reason might be that we priests are standing in there under obscure vaults and telling neither rhyme nor reason.” He further says, about sermons: “There certainly is something to the saying that there is drowsiness in the Church. Sometimes our sermons may serve as sheer sleeping pills.”—The Stockholm Svenska Dagbladet, January 23, 1959.

Announcements
FIELD MINISTRY
Christians are instructed to be ‘assembling still more as the day nears.’ (Heb. 10:25) Not only will we continue to do so, but we will encourage others to see the importance of assembling with Jehovah’s people. To that end, we will offer to the people during July the fine book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and another helpful Bible-study book, with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.
SECURITY DURING WAR
For your safety and the eternal welfare of your family you will want to hear the timely and vitally important subject SECURITY DURING “WAR of the Great Day of God the Almighty.” It will be the featured Bible talk at all the Peace-pursuing District Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses this summer. Write the branch office nearest you for details.

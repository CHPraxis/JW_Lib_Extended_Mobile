<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Writing in <em>Travels in Arabia Deserta, </em>Charles M. Doughty describes a locust invasion: “The clouds of the second locust brood . . . wreathing and flickering as motes in the sunbeam, flew over us for some days, thick as rain, from near the soil to great height in the atmosphere. They alight as birds, letting down their long shanks to the ground; these invaded the booths, and for blind hunger, even bit our shins, as we sat at coffee. They are borne freely flying at the wind’s list, as in the Psalms, ‘I am tossed up and down as the locust.’ . . . The children bring in gathered locusts, broached upon a twig, and the nomads toast them on the coals; then plucking the scorched members, they break away the head, and the insect body which remains is good meat; but not of these latter swarms, born in time of the dried-up herbiage.”</p>

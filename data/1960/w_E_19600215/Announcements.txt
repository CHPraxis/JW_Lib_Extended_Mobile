1960 MEMORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
The time draws near when Jehovah’s people, both the remnant and other sheep will assemble as congregations for the observance of the most significant of all memorials, the one that annually commemorates the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. The date this year is Sunday, April 10. The discourse is to be given by a capable speaker, one of the remnant if available and capable. Each congregation should start making arrangements for the Memorial, and all persons who are truly of good will toward Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ will want to make definite arrangements to attend.

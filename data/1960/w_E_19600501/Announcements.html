<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Carefully searching the Scriptures results in promoting accurate knowledge among those who are God’s ministers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 1:9, 10</a>) During May Jehovah’s witnesses will use accurate knowledge by witnessing to others and presenting the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </em>and a Bible-study booklet on a contribution of 75c. If you would like to have a share in this work, contact Jehovah’s witnesses at a nearby Kingdom Hall or write to this office.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHOSE PROMISE DO YOU TRUST?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Men make campaign promises in order to gain a political office. Not so with God. His position as Supreme Sovereign is assured. Therefore his promises are thoroughly reliable. Many men, though, have made promises in God’s name that He never purposed. Are you sure your hope is properly founded? Do you know for certain what God’s Word promises for our future? Send only 75c for the 256-page book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </em>and receive free the revealing booklet <em>God’s Way Is Love.</em></p>

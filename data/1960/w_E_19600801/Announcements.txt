FIELD MINISTRY
During August Jehovah’s witnesses will continue ‘using initiative and defense in their ministry.’ (1 Pet. 3:13, 15) They will offer to all persons the splendid Bible-study aid “Your Will Be Done on Earth” together with another book and two booklets, on a $1 contribution. Would you like to share in this Christian service? You can receive further information by going to the Kingdom Hall in your vicinity or by writing to the publishers of this magazine.
THERE IS STILL TIME!
World conditions threaten even though peace talks and disarmament conferences have gone on among the nations’ leaders. In view of such you will want to be present at one of the Peace-pursuing District Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses to absorb the excellent counsel from God’s Word now due to be understood. The featured talk “Security During ‘War of the Great Day of God the Almighty’” will thrill you! Write the office of The Watchtower for particulars. There is still time!

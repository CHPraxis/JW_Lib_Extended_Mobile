<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since <em>The Watchtower </em>takes the lead in ‘guarding freedom for doing God’s complete will,’ it should be in the homes of all lovers of true freedom. During April Jehovah’s witnesses will make it possible for all to have this magazine coming regularly to their homes, by offering a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and three Bible booklets, for $1.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Did you obtain just this single issue of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Thousands of persons have first received <em>The Watchtower </em>in just that way. But the rapidly growing subscription list shows that their interest goes much farther. You can obtain each issue regularly too. Send only $1 today and receive free the booklets <em>“This Good News of the Kingdom,” After Armageddon—God’s New World </em>and <em>God’s Way Is Love.</em></p>

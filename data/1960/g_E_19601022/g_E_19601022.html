<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font0">N THIS age of expediency many would rather see a good example than he one. Setting a good example is not found convenient or advantageous in a competitive world. Accordingly, bad examples flourish. Rudeness is excused in the name of haste. Lying and hypocrisy masquerade as diplomacy. Marital infidelity comes under the heading of a psychological safety valve. Stealing equalizes the wealth. Obscene speech proves manhood and, not infrequently, womanhood. Cheating is winked at in school because “everybody does it.” Obviously the cult of expediency has many disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Any twinge of conscience from all this is easily stifled. Some adopt the calloused retort of manslayer Cain: “Am I my brother’s guardian?” (Gen. 4:9) Others reason that, since we live in an age of specialization, we can leave the setting of good examples to the specialists such as clergymen, teachers and law-enforcement officers. “Is that not what they are paid for?” Two other philosophies must not be overlooked. One says things are not as bad as they look; there is a little good in everybody. The other says, “Cheer up’ You may not be completely worthless. You can always serve as a bad example.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One thing escapes their notice. While the hardheartedness of Cain is not dead, neither is the God who judged him guilty. Expediency may have debased modern man, but it has not dethroned God. The Supreme Court of heaven has not adjourned to accommodate man’s lack of good example. Neither has man’s lack of spiritual vision blinded Jehovah, for his Lawbook declares: &quot;The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, keeping watch upon the bad ones and the good ones.” (Prov. 15:3) To attempt to justify all kinds of bad examples in the name of expediency, including the matter of lying and vile speech, Jesus showed to be very unwise: “I tell you that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day; for by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.” —Matt. 12:36,. 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Assigning the duty of setting good examples to “specialists” is likewise unacceptable to God, as Paul indicated: “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (Heb. 4: 13) Furthermore, it is not uncommon for leaders of the people to fail miserably at setting good examples. Yet Jesus showed that this does not excuse the people’s obligation to perform: “The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses. Therefore all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but do not perform.” (Matt. 23:2, 3) Likewise, if Christendom’s clergymen lean toward militarism in time of war and materialism in time of peace, that does not excuse you from the duty to set a good example by keeping God’s law. Search for the true Christian congregation, where those in positions of responsibility set a good example by working with their own hands, practicing what they preach, not “lording it over those who are Gqd’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.”—1 Pet. 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purpose in setting good examples is for others to copy. That is why young Timothy was counseled: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.” (1 Tim. 4:12) If you are among the “faithful ones” who please God, then you must set a good example in all things. The words and deeds of man either honor or dishonor God, and he takes note accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Neither can the practice of setting a good example be relaxed at home among the family circle. The conduct of each member of the family influences the thinking of the other. What parents say and do determines what the children do. Dr. Art-gelo Patri made an interesting observation on this point in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How'to Help Your Child Grow Up:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Parents have to discipline themselves, make good models, set good patterns for children . . . you cannot teach religion to a child unless you possess it in your mind and soul and practice it while you live out your days beside him. ... If you have not kept faith with your religion, it is idle for you to send him for religious instruction. What you are, he knows; what you do, he registers as his pattern . . . Would you lead your children in the love of God? Love him and do his will, and they will go along with you . . , What you would have your child be, express in your daily example.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Get in the habit of setting a good example, and you will find it easier as your mind is made over. Age or sex or race is no barrier. In 176 nations hundreds of thousands are learning to set a good example by studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Soon they learn what Jehovah requires and how to copy him. This is in keeping with the Bible counsel; “Become imitators of God.” (Eph. 5:1) From the pages of the Bible will come to life the principles of the one true religion that guided faithful men and women in setting good examples and gaining God’s favor and the hope of a resurrection into his new world. If you worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, he will back you up with his active force. You will find it possible to copy the faith of Abraham, the endurance of Job, the meekness of Moses, the wifely submission of Sarah, the fearlessness of the early Christians and, in great measure, the love of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Knowing how to set a good example and doing it not only bring peace to the mind and joy to the heart, but will preserve your soul alive into God’s new world, now very near. In that paradise earth no place will be found for the disciples of expediency, for Jehovah says: “There will prove to be no future for anyone bad; the very lamp of wicked people will be extinguished.” “In the path of righteousness there is life, and the journey in its pathway means no death.”—Prov. 24:20; 12:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Be practical, then, and set a good example!</span></p><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-3.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:125pt;">
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Danger has no prejudice; it strikes regardless of race or creed. Yet people like yourself are finding true safety in the world crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">F</span><span class="font0">IFTEEN short years ago the atomic bomb rang down a bloody curtain on the final act of World War II. The six-year tragedy was enacted at a horrible cost of 22 million lives, 34 million wounded and $1.3 trillion. Ironically, the same nuclear weapon raised the curtain on a new crisis potentially more stark and ugly—possible extinction of the human race through atomic war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Newspaperman Bruce Hutchison spelled out the crisis in the Victoria TirzieB: “In an ultimate exercise of unconscious irony and quaint irrelevance, the world’s parliaments are devising measures of social security while talking absent-mindedly now and then about the prospective end of civilization. . . , Our crisis is different from any previous crisis not only in size but in kind because we have no assurance of time and we cannot tolerate another war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The United Nations World Health Organization revealed another ugly face to the global crisis in the form of disease. Said WHO: “The five great pestilences of history—plague, cholera, smallpox, typhus and yellow fever—still linger on, an ever-</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>in the World Crisis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">present menace in our age of rapid air and sea transport. . . . Radioactive wastes, if not carefully disposed of, may dangerously pollute the air, soil and water, and increased background radiation may even have harmful effects on the heredity of the human race. . . . Malaria is the world’s most expensive disease. It renders vast fertile areas unfit for habitation, weakens agricultural production wherever it exists, and bars economic and social progress . . . Yaws, a crippling infection that threatens half the people in tropical areas . . . Tuberculosis still ranks among the world’s greatest killers . . . Where health services and medical care are well-advanced, diseases such as poliomyelitis, cancer and heart disease become leading causes of sickness and death . . . The sicknesses caused by bad sanitation are among the first five causes of death in the world as a whole ... Mental health is increasingly threatened by the stresses and strains of rapid progress and industrialization in countries at all stages of economic development.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rapid exhaustion of earth’s natural resources intensifies the world crisis. An example is the United States. According to biologist Julian Huxley, “The consumption of metals and mineral fuels by the United States since 1918 exceeds the total consumed by the whole of mankind in all preceding history!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While millions already suffer from insufficient food, the world’s population is increasing so alarmingly that it is expected to double by the end of the century! In a number of highly developed countries such as England Huxley finds there is serious rivalry between use of land for producing vital food and for necessities such as housing and roads..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No generation has had such a desperate need of moral and spiritual strength to meet a crisis as ours does, yet spiritually and morally ours is one of the weakest. This is demonstrated daily by outbreaks of murder, muggings, adultery, robbery, rape and wholesale dishonesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of even greater concern, however, is the fact that Armageddon, the war of the great day of God the Almighty, is to strike in this generation. Of it a United States congressman declared: “In very truth the world seems to be mobilizing for the great battle of Armageddon.&quot; Serious students of Bible prophecy have warned for some time that since 1914 numerous predicted events have come to pass with precision, clearly indicating that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the terrible crisis</span><span class="font0"> of Armageddon stares us in the face. Of that worst-of-all crises, Jesus foretold: “There will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” No wonder people everywhere “suffer from a deep sense of inadequacy and insecurity,” as one prominent minister observed.—Matt. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">24:21; Rev. </span><span class="font0">16:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">True Security</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The decisions needed for safety in the world crisis are essentially moral and spiritual. Lacking strength for this, rulers and people fall back on the familiar but unsatisfactory security of armaments and money. Against this fallacy the Bible long ago warned: “Woe to those . . . who put their trust in war chariots, . . . but who have not looked to the Holy One of Israel and have not searched for Jehovah.” “The one trusting in his riches—he himself will fall.”-—Isa. 31:1-3; Prov. 11:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">King Solomon, one of the wisest and wealthiest of men, was inspired to point the way to true security when he wrote: “Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.” Is such lifepreserving </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wisdom available to a generation</span><span class="font0"> facing Armageddon? Yes! God’s prophet Daniel foretold that in “the time of the end . . . the true knowledge will become abundant.” (Eccl. 7:12; Dan. 12:4) Christ Jesus, the Greater Solomon, predicted for our time a house-to-house distribution of this knowledge, saying: “This good news of the kingdom </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">will be preached</span><span class="font0"> in ah the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) This witness work done in 176 lands today involves Bible doctrine and discipline that provide safety in the world crisis. Here huhdreds of thousands of men and women like yourself are finding security and hope. You know them by their name Jehovah’s witnesses. Consider how they are able to face the world crisis and say, in the words of the psalmist: “Entirely in peace I will lie down and sleep, for you yourself alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.” —Ps. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fear of nuclear war does not paralyze the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah God promises that he will preserve many of this generation alive into his peaceful new world, and of that postArmageddon earth it is prophesied: &quot;Behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth.” Fulfilling Micah’s prophecy of the pre-Armageddon era, the international family of witnesses now “beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war any more ... and there will be no one making them tremble.” (Ps. 46: 8, 9; Mic. 4:3, 4) Diligently studying Jehovah’s laws and putting them into daily practice, these true Christians enjoy the secure “peace of God that excels all thought.” Their attention is focused on the early and complete fulfillment of Jesus’ model prayer for God’s kingdom to come and for Jehovah’s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.—Phil. 4:7; Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Neither does the World Health Organization’s 999 categories of disease, injury and death despoil the security of true Christians. They know that beyond Armageddon lies the safety from sickness and death promisedin Holy Scripture:-“Look!” said the apostle John, “the tent of God is with humankind . . . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any” more. The former things have passed away.” This promise, coupled with God’s power of resurrection, removes fear of disease and death.—Rev. 21:3, 4; 1 Cor. 15:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Additionally, present application of Christian principles of clean living and moderation as well as happy mental outlook have delivered servants of Jehovah from much unnecessary illness that strikes the world in the form of heart trouble, venereal disease, lung cancer and many ailments attributed to tension. When illness does strike, they are in the best frame of mind to face it and co-operate with the medical treatment prescribed in harmony with God’s laws. A cheerful heart is itself a wonderful medicine. None is more joyful than the one with hope in Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Economic and Domestic Security</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Economic recessions, depressions or natural disasters likewise seem less painful for those safe under Jehovah’s provisions and promises. Men of all nations bound together with love for God and his kingdom delight to aid one another. This is done gladly among the world-wide association of Christian witnesses of Jehovah, who quickly respond to the material and spiritual needs of their neighbors. Their knowledge from God also gives assurance that Jehovah will shortly “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” After the Armageddon crisis is safely past, there will be no overcrowded earth or global food shortage, for God has promised: “The earth itself will certainly give its produce; God, our God, will bless us.” (Rev. 11:18; Ps. 67:6) Not even the powerful forces of nature will kill or maim as they do today. Jesus may choose to calm the storms as he once did on the Sea of Galilee, or warn his New World subjects to get to a safe place. (Mark 4:39) On man’s behalf Jehovah will even conclude a covenant with animal life, removing any mutual threat. Says the Creator: “I will make them lie down in .security.”—Hos. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Domestically, there is great safety today in strict adherence to the high moral standards marked out in the Bible. In the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses immorality is not tolerated. In all the activities of life they are guided by the strong and healthful fear of Jehovah. Christian husbands obey the command to love their wives as their own bodies; wives deeply respect their marriage head, and children are trained from infancy to obey their parents in<sup>1</sup> the Lord. Following these principles brings security to parents and children. (Eph. 5:22-33; 6:1-4) Youth raised “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” have strong protection from a fall into juvenile delinquency, the modern plague of young people. The security of a happy family circle now and the prospect of even greater happiness in the righteous new world at hand are the delight of Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Security for You</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom,” says the inspired proverb. By diligent Bible study get to know Jehovah now while he may be found, for therein lies your safety in the world crisis. Before you will stretch the hope of endless life in God’s new world, the security of which is guaranteed by such promises as this: “For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil.” (Prov. 9:10; 1 John 3:8) Yes, at Armageddon God’s kingdom under Christ will destroy Satan and his wicked spirit forces, who constitute the present wicked “heavens.” Armageddon will also mean an end to the visible organizations and governments opposing God’s rule, which visible parts of Satan’s world are the symbolic “earth.” For this reason the apostle Peter wrote: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—Eph. 6:12; 2 Pet 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are not yet among the more than 600,000 families or individuals receiving weekly free Bible instruction from one of Jehovah’s witnesses, write to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font0">magazine for information. The abundant true knowledge of God’s Word and purposes foretold by the prophet Daniel is for your safety and preservation in the world crisis. Show appreciation to Jehovah God by seeking it and putting it into immediate practice. Have a part in helping others find the way to true security and happiness now and in God’s new world.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With Jehovah as your shield in the world crisis, you will then confidently say, in the words of the psalmist: “The salvation of the righteous ones is from Jehovah; he is their fortress in the time of distress. And Jehovah will help them and provide them with escape . . . and save them, because they have taken refuge in him.” —Ps. 37:39, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EYES MADE FDR OWNERS' NEEDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">fl. &quot;In 10 years I have taken some 5,000 animal photographs, including eye details in about 500,” writes Constance P. Warner in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geographic Magazine</span><span class="font17"> of April, 1959. “Reviewing them, I marvel at the logic that shines through nature's eyes. Each fits its owner alone.. . . The burrow-hiding prairie dog, for example, wears its eyes high upon its head and widely spaced, like many other hunted creatures. The eyes themselves can focus full circle without telltale movement. A dissected prairie dog' eyeball reveals an amber-tinted lens that Alters the glare of the plains. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">fl, “The common eel dwells in both fresh and salt water, among stones, in mud, at times even in drying air. Its eyes roll, well protected, beneath tough, transparent picture windows, clear places in its head skin. The Cuban shovel-nosed toad squatting in its burrow folds its upper lid far over the lower, forming a dirt-proof seal that rivals any envelope. The Southwest’s Gila monster digs through sand for water and eggs of other animals. Its tiny eyes, ringed with beaded scales, are shielded by thick third eyelids that resemble heavy white satin. . . . Birds have shown me nictitating membranes—third eyelids—in incredible variety of color, pattern, and texture. The hooded merganser wears a glass I ike membrane appropriate to underwater pursuit of fish. . . . The speedy duck hawk has a crystal-clear third lid that can take the buffeting of a 180-mile-an-hour power dive. The slower bluejay’s third lid flashes across its eye, opaque and beautifully crosshatched; that of the American robin is streaked like onion skin. . . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">fl, &quot;While studying the eye of a summer flounder at Woods Hole, I pondered a dainty ‘parasol’ projecting over its pupil. The related winter flounder lacks this eyeshade. Why? A few minutes at the library offered one explanation. The voracious summer species often pursues its dinner to the sunlit surface of the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W</span><span class="font0">ITHOUT it you would be unable to write your name, read a book, or speak your thoughts. In fact, you would not be able to think. Without it there would be no doctors, lawyers, butchers, bakers; no, not even unskilled laborers. Without it you would be inferior to the animals, for even they have it. You should be thankful that your Creator gave it to you. He gave you a memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The average person </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">seldom thinks about </span><span class="font0">his memory, and consequently rarely does anything to improve it. But with a little attention your memory can be improved and be helpful to you in many ways, if you remember to use it. Daily it can save you hours of work, retaining information for which you would otherwise have to search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your ability to remember is the basis for all the knowledge that you possess. To a large extent it determines whether you will be a success or a failure in whatever you undertake. For example, suppose you were ill and went to visit a doctor that recently moved into your neighborhood. How would you feel if, after your telling him about your ailment, he had no suggestion to offer, but picked up his medical school lecture notes and some reference books and feverishly leafed through the pages to discover what was wrong with you? He forgot what your symptoms meant! How much confidence would you place in him and bis diagnosis? A similar failure could be true in occupations where the memory plays even the smallest part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did you ever see a runner improve his stride by merely watching others run, or a skier develop speed by only watching others ski? No, something more than observing is necessary—exercise. Memory training parallels physical training and requires regular mental exercise. Without it there can be no improvement. In his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How to Develop a Super-Power Memory </span><span class="font0">Harry Lorayne says: “The memory, in</span></p><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-4.png" alt="" style="width:203pt;height:181pt;">
<p><span class="font0">many ways, is like a muscle. A muscle must be exercised and developed in order to give proper service and use; so must the memory.” At first it requires hard work, but in time it will become automatic. So train yourself to use your memory, and never forget to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A word of caution: When engaged in memory training keep away from alcohol! The two do not mix. Alcohol hampers your ability to remember and causes you to forget. Jehovah, man’s Creator and the Bible’s Author, knew this fact, for he inspired King Lemuel to write: “It is not for kings to drink wine or for high officials to say: ‘Where is intoxicating liquor?’ that one may not drink and forget what is decreed ... Let one drink and forget one’s poverty, and let one remember one’s own trouble no more.”—Prov. 31:4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Be Interested and Selective</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One day a schoolboy was called to account by his mother for bringing home a very low history mark. In reply the youth said: “But, Mom, I just can’t remember all those names and dates!” Yet that same afternoon, when talking to his playmates about bis favorite baseball team, it was a different story. He poured out the record of his team, listing the number of home runs, hits, strike outs, double plays, errors, and batting averages for each player—all by memory! What made the difference? Why could our schoolboy remember baseball and not history? Because he was interested in one and not the other. This illustrates an important point for us to remember. Be interested in what you wish to memorize; otherwise, forget about it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Once you have chosen a field of interest, select and memorize only the material that you need. Do not try to remember unnecessary information. Corey Ford, writing in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post,</span><span class="font0"> explains the reason why when he says; “Suppose I wanted to memorize Ocean 9-2561. The 9 is a baseball team, of course, and 2 and 5. are the respective ages of my wife’s sister’s two children, and 6 plus 1 makes 7, which is my hat size. So I can think of my wife’s sister’s two children playing baseball with my hat in the ocean, or else I can look up the number in the directory and save myself all the trouble.” So save yourself trouble and work. There is no need to remember many phone numbers, isolated facts and statistics that you seldom use. If you do use them often, you will remember them anyway. Select the material that will be useful to you in your work or personal life and determine to remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Learn to Concentrate</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did you ever ask someone for the time during a conversation, and then shortly afterward ask: “What time did you say it was?” Lack of interest was not the only reason you failed to remember, because you had enough interest to ask. If you had an appointment, the time was probably on your mind. But was your mind on the time? Actually, this was more a case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> getting than forgetting. You really cannot forget something until you first get it. In order to get it you must concentrate on it. If you had concentrated upon the time when you first heard it, you would have remembered it. Most people have never learned to concentrate properly. Have you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Would you like to test your ability to concentrate? The next time you are sitting in a room with the radio turned on, or perhaps on a subway with its high noise level, fix your eye on some specific object and concentrate on it. See how long you can keep your eyes and mind glued to that one object without allowing any other thought or object to divert your attention, even for an instant. The slightest distraction ends your concentration. At first it may be only a few seconds, but with practice you can learn to concentrate for indefinite periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Once you have learned to concentrate under distracting conditions, apply this ability under conditions that are not distracting; concentrate where it is quiet. You should try to be wide-awake and relaxed, both physically and mentally. Do not try to concentrate immediately after eating, because then you may be drowsy. Learn to concentrate on everything you do, and you will find that you enjoy it more and remember it longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge of Association</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Are you embarrassed when you encounter a person that you know, but whose name you cannot seem to remember? No doubt you are, but quite possibly the other person is also, since he probably does not remember your name either. Failing to remember names is a common shortcoming. Yet history tells us that Cyrus was able to call every soldier in his army by name, and Lucius Scipio knew the name of every citizen of Rome. So you should be able to remember the names of most of the people you meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To hurdle the obstacle of remembering, you need a bridge—the bridge of association. The use of association enables you to bridge the things you wish to remember to the things you already know. It is therefore essential to know the three ways in which you can use association: visually, logically, and by classification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whenever you learn something new, you learn it by association with something you have in your memory. At first children learn only by visualizing things that can be seen and are real. Thus parents are often frightened when they see their child poking an electric plug into a wall outlet. The child does not understand what he is doing; he only remembers seeing the plug fit into the outlet because of previous visual association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">hi forming the bridge of association, you are often called upon to visualize things that cannot be seen, such as names and thoughts. For this you must call upon your imagination. You can apply both real and imaginative visual association to remembering names and faces. Since no two •persons look exactly alike, remember a person’s face by the differences you see. Note specific features, such as the shape of the eyes and eyebrows, the particular way in which the hair is combed, whether the mouth is long, short, full, or thin, and any special marks or scars. Then take the name and associate it with one or more of these features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bridge of ■ association by logic is available to those who are old enough to develop their thinking ability. For example, if you wish to think about the subject of television, your mind will take in more than just the TV set that may be in your living room. Your mind will also think of the television station, cameras, actors, transmitters, antennas (and the TV repairman) ; things you know are related to television because of logic based upon previous experience or knowledge of the subject. It is this logical association of related subjects that enables you to bridge to your memory material that you read, and lectures and stories that you hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every book or article you read and every lecture you hear generally has one underlying thought or theme that the rest of the material supports or explains. There are major supporting points, minor supporting points, and, of course, a mass of detail. The major points are found in chapter titles of a book; the minor points occupy the positions of subheadings within the chapters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order to remember what you read, you must learn the underlying thought, the major and minor points, and the logical relationship between them. First, look through the table of contents and try to establish a relationship between the chapters. Keep this relationship in mind as you read through the book. Then follow this same pattern with the minor points. Remember, each sentence is part of a paragraph, each paragraph is part of a subheading, each subheading is part of a chapter, and each chapter is part of the underlying thought or theme of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Next, condense each point into a single word, a key word. By remembering these key words, and by knowing the logical relationship that exists between them, you can remember the complete outline of anything that you read. Apply these same principles to listening, being sure to listen carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you find it necessary to memorize lists of items, you will obtain a better bridge of association by first classifying them. Classification makes it possible to find books in libraries, food in supermarkets, and letters in files. Develop your own categories for lists of items and then use them. It may save you hours of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Say It Again, Again and Again</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Association will bridge information to your memory. Repetition will keep it there. You must learn, however, to use repetition over a period of time, because you forget more the first day after memorizing than during the next thirty days. Remember the outline first, then each day fill in more detail. Once the material is committed to memory, repeat it each day for about a week, then each week for about a month, and then review it every few months. You will find that it will take less time to remember more material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Use repetition in all your memory tasks. To remember a person’s name, be sure to get the name first, next associate it with the face, and then repeatedly address the person by his or her name. The principle of repetition applies to everything. If you want to remember news that you heard, sights that you saw, jokes that you heard, or books that you read, repeat them to yourself, think about them, tell them to others. Yes, say it again, again and again!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no time like the present to begin developing your memory. It will aid you if you keep in mind this brief outline or summary of the principles involved: (1) Determine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font0"> you want to remember; develop interest in it; be selective in your material. (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font0"> to remember? By concentration, association (visual, logical, by classification) and repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These key points are essential. Be sure that you understand why. Associate them logically in your mind. Then, as opportunity affords, teach these points to others and you will remember them yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Learn to use your memory and use it well. It is a God-given gift that acts as a constant, valuable companion. Use it often and it will always be faithful. Your memory will not fail you if you do not fail to use your memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Reporting on studies made on camels in the Sahara Desert, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen writes in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font17"> of December, 1959: &quot;In the burning heat of the desert an Inanimate object such as a rock may reach a temperature of more than 150 degrees F. A camel in such an environment, like a man, maintains a tolerable body temperature by sweating. But where the temperature of the man remains virtually constant as the day grows hotter, the temperature of the camel Increases slowly to about 105 degrees. As the temperature of the camel rises, the animal sweats very little; only when its temperature reaches 105 degrees does it sweat freely. The camel’s elevated temperature also lessens its absorption of heat, which of course depends on the difference between the temperature of Its body and that of the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;The camel lowers the heat load on its body still further by letting its temperature fall below normal during the cool desert night. ... As a result of its flexible body temperature the camel sweats little except during the hottest hours of the day, where a man in the same environment perspires almost from sunrise to sunset. . . . The camel employs camel-hair Insulation to lower its heat load still further. Even during the summer, when the camel sheds much of its wool, it retains a layer several Inches thick on its back where the sun beats down. When we sheared the wool from one of our camels, we found that the shorn animal produced 60 per cent more sweat than an unshorn one. . . . The camel’s hump also helps indirectly to lessen the heat load on the animal. Nearly all mammals possess a food reserve in the form of fat, but in most of them the fat is distributed fairly uniformly over the body just beneath the skin. In having Its fat concentrated in one place the camel lacks insulation between its body and its skin, where evaporative cooling takes place. The absence of insulation facilitates the flow of heat outward, just as the insulating wool slows the flow of heat inward.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">SfiQTAY here three years and it will be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">O come home to you; you will not want to leave.” Such was the advice given to a new resident of Chieng Mai, Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was good advice, for while great earth-shaking events have not made Chieng Mai world famous, undoubtedly memories of this truly charming city will linger long in the hearts of those who have ever lived or visited here. One who has shared some of Chieng Mai’s fascinating sights and customs will surely agree that it really is an Oriental garden of natural beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Located in the northern part of the country, this city of 75,000 people is nestled close to the foot of Thailand’s third-highest mountain peak, Doi Su Tep. It is well connected with the capital, Bangkok, by train, plane or road. Traveling by train is the most popular, as the airplane proves too expensive for most, and the road is veiy rough and often very muddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">From Bangkok to Chieng Mai</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The trip from Bangkok by train takes twenty hours. After a magnificent sunset the train starts its long, laborious climb into the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. Soon the night has passed and the gray of dawn gives way to the rising sun. Like a beautiful Oriental lady garbed in brilliant colors, it spreads a fan of vermilion across the sky. The water in the fields below, planted with a soft green carpet of young rice, looks as if the artist of this beautify! scene had dropped his palette of paints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the hours and the train speed on together whole families are observed at work</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-5.png" alt="" style="width:186pt;height:173pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">in the rice paddies, plowing and planting according to ancient methods. Water buffaloes soak in pools of mud, unmindful of the crows perched on their backs. Villages of bamboo huts flash by as little naked children look up from their play to wave happily. About noon the train slows down and comes to a smooth halt. Ah! You have arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our railway station offers a warm welcome to Chieng Mai. The visitor or native coming home is met by crowds of happy, laughing people eagerly reaching up to receive baggage of all sizes and shapes, which is handed out through train windows. You see, to alight from a train here in Thailand with your baggage would result in a disastrous traffic jam, as the aisles are so narrow. So the custom is to hand your baggage out the window to waiting friends or relatives. If no one is meeting you, some kind fellow passenger will hand you your possessions after you have alighted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amid all the happy confusion take time to notice the artistically arranged flower gardens that border the platform. Their cheerfulness seems to say: “Welcome to Chieng Mai, Thailand’s Garden City.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you emerge from the station you will be met with a rush of blue-garbed men in short pants, swarming around you like bees. Keep a careful grip on your baggage or it may soon be scattered beyond recovery. But, you may ask, surely these men are not thieves! Oh, no! They are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">samlOT </span><span class="font0">drivers and they just want your business; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Samlor</span><span class="font0"> is a Thai word that means “three wheels.” In this case the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">samlor</span><span class="font0"> refers to the tricycle-type taxi or pedicab, which seats two people unless you are native Thai, in which case as many as two adults and four children can be crowded in!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this point many questions may fill your mind. What is the nature of the Thai people? How do they live? What are their hopes and dreams?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Friendly People</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One needs only to stand on the street corner a few minutes to get an insight into the Thai nature. The people are kind, hospitable, fun-loving and intensely curious. Proof of the latter is this; if you stand there five minutes someone is certain to come over and ask, “Where are you going?” Or show a letter to a friend on the street and very likely an old man will approach and peer over your shoulder to see what you have. It is not rudeness, just curiosity. Visit a Thai home and you will have to satisfy such questions as: “Where do you come from? Are you married? How many children do you have?” before you can state the purpose of your call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Making a business or social call on a Thai household is an enjoyable experience in itself. You cannot knock on a door, because usually an open porch serves as the living room. Simply mount the stairs, call out a greeting and wait for the housewife to come. Soon she appears, wiping soapsuds off her hands, and greets you as if you were a life-long friend. It is really an honor that you have called. To show this she hurriedly unrolls a red straw mat for you to sit on. Just as good as a red carpet, isn’t it? Next she brings you an earthenware jug of water with an intricately hand-beaten silver bowl from which to drink. Afterward, when you are ready to leave, she will thank you many times for calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Truly you have been warmly welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When one speaks with the Thai people it becomes apparent that they have no real hope for the future. Their religion teaches them to be indifferent about everything. So their thoughts rest only with today. They all want happiness but feel that such cannot be gained in the flesh, so their ultimate goal is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nippan,</span><span class="font0"> a state of nonexistence. However, in this scenic Oriental garden city where there is every kind of tree and flower to delight the eyes, there are also trees to delight the heart; these are human “trees of righteousness.” For here, as in all parts of the earth, Jehovah’s witnesses preach and teach about God’s kingdom, the heavenly government that will shortly transform this whole earth into a garden Paradise for all men of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Thai Bouse</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A visit to the friendly Thais affords an excellent opportunity to see how a typical Thai house is, constructed. Besides the living-room-porch there is often only one other room, which serves as the family bedroom. Because there may be many in the family who must sleep in a small area, the mattresses laid on the floor at night are folded up during the day to allow more room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The kitchen is very often a corner of the open porch, with a woven bamboo mat to separate it from the living quarters. Utensils consist of one or more charcoal burners, a pan for washing dishes, two or three pots for cooking and a wooden bucket with a removable bottom for steaming the rice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tables and ehairs are not needed, as the food is placed on a tray and set on the floor, with the family grouped around it. A meal may consist of a large bowl of glutinous rice, several small bowls of curries, vegetables and a little bit of meat. The Thai people never eat meat in the quantities that their Western neighbors do. The sticky rice is formed into a small bite-sized ball, dipped into the curries and other foods and eaten. If boiled rice is used, the curries and vegetables are placed on top of the rice and eaten with a spoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The foundation of the house is composed of thick bamboo poles or wooden posts protruding about six feet out of the ground. On this the floor frame is placed. Next comes the bamboo flooring, which has been split and spread out flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The walls and doors are constructed of woven bamboo, and the roof is of dried teak leaves laid like shingles. This house can be built for about twenty-five to thirty dollars and can easily be dismantled and moved to another location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When children grow up and marry they often build a house near the husband’s parents, since family life in Chieng Mai is something of a patriarchal one. A fence surrounds the entire group of houses, and this fenced-in area is commonly called a “compound.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old and New</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many improvements are being made in Chieng Mai’s shopping district. Streets are being widened to accommodate the heavier traffic of cars and buses, and new sidewalks are being laid to accommodate the pedestrians. You may note with a touch of humor, however, that the old ways have not given up without a struggle. Along the main street you may see a flock of goats sauntering casually through a red light, blissfully ignorant of the snarled-up traffic left behind. Yet it is not anger at the harmless animals that appears on the faces of motorists and pedestrians, but amused expressions of indifference, for the people here have one common way of meeting most situations in their lives, whether of sorrow or joy, and that is with a mildly spoken, “Afdi </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ben rai” </span><span class="font0">or “Never mind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The city has built a new, attractive bridge spanning the Mae Ping River, which divides the city. The scene from the center of this bridge is a delight to the heart. It appears that you have entered a tropical garden of pure loveliness. The lazily flowing river will almost make you forget that there are so many troubles in the world. Its banks are lined with graceful coconut palms gaily waving their branches in the air as if to say they delight in making their part of the earth beautiful. Comfortable trees, heavy with fruit, harbor happily chattering birds. Here and there pagodas from Buddhist wats or temples tower above the trees in reminder that this lovely garden is an Oriental one.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font0">S A room that is attractively furnished and artistically decorated brings pleasure to the eye, so a room that is filled with good music brings pleasure to the ear. This pleasure has been greatly enhanced by the thrilling realism made possible by modem soundreproducing equipment. The vibrant sound of a xylophone and the clear tone of violins are so clearly reproduced that the instruments seem to be right there in the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A listener can have the feeling of being in the center section of a concert hall when a stereophonic sound system brings the music of a symphony orchestra into his home with startling reality. The same fullness and concert-hall spaciousness appear to be there as well as the same clarity of tones and delicate shadings in volume. Even the sense of direction is there, as instruments are heard playing on the left, others in the center and still others on the right. The entire orchestra seems to be spread out across the room. This remarkable musical realism is the wonder of stereophonic sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the advent of the stereo record in 1957, the popularity of stereophonic home music systems has grown tremendously, and, as might be expected with something that is popular, there are many machines bearing the stereophonic label that are not actually that at all. They have caused many persons to be disillusioned about stereo. A person should, therefore, know what to look for when he decides to bring to his</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How Stereo la Different</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The biggest difference in stereo from other means for reproducing music is the sense of spaciousness and depth it gives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It creates the illusion that the performance is in a large hall by reproducing the reverberations that would strike the two ears of a listener in the original hall. Approximately 90 percent of the sound energy that reaches the audience at a live performance may have been reflected from the walls and other surfaces in the auditorium. Although many of these secondary sounds are of short duration and may not be heard separately, they affect the over-all sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sense of direction in the music must also be created for the feeling of realism to exist. Although music coming from one speaker may be beautifully reproduced, as when coming from a good high-fidelity system, the sense of realism is not as great as in stereo because direction is lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then, too, your good sense tells you that the orchestra could not be crammed into one spot in a room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By adding an extra speaker to a nonstereo music sys-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-8.png" alt="" style="width:181pt;height:113pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">tern, the music can be spread across the room, but it will still</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-9.png" alt="" style="width:114pt;height:132pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">direction, depth and spaciousness. This is due to the fact that the sound from the two speakers is identical; whereas in a live performance your two ears do not hear identical sounds coming from both sides of an orchestra. Your ears can detect the location of distinct sounds, especially sounds with high frequencies, because of the infinitesimal difference in time from when a sound wave strikes one ear until it strikes the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The over-all blend of sound from the orchestra, along with its reverberations from the walls of the hall around the listener at a live performance, gives a specific impression upon each ear. The stereophonic music system attempts to reproduce these distinct impressions. This gives the reproduced music direction, depth and spaciousness that cannot be had when the sound is reproduced by a nonstereo music system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The quality of reproduced music is also essential in conveying an illusion of musical realism. In the radio-phonograph combinations that people were accustomed to before high fidelity made its appearance, the quality of reproduced sound was atrociously poor by comparison. These machines not only failed to reproduce all the music but greatly distorted it, besides adding various background noises such as loud hum, rumble, popping and cracking. They very often gave out a tinny sound. The music they reproduced might be compared to a picture that is out of focus. Although the picture may be indistinct, the images in it may still be recognizable because your imagination fills in what is lacking. The same is true, in a greater sense, with music that is poorly reproduced. The fuzzy sound from the old radio-phonographs with their muddy bass tones beat upon your ears, but your mind ignored the distortion and concentrated upon what you wanted to hear. Your imagination made up for what was lacking. Listening fatigue, caused by the distorted sound, probably made you feel a sense of pleasant relief when the machine was turned off.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19601022_files/g_E_19601022-10.png" alt="" style="width:187pt;height:120pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">The old radio-phonographs failed to reproduce sounds much higher than 5,000 or 8,000 cycles, and, also, in the very low musical region they had no response. The high tones of a musical triangle might be heard coming from the phonograph needle but not from the speaker. Obviously, the music system that reproduces sounds up to 15,000 cycles and clear bass tones down to fifty cycles or lower gives more realism and beauty to music. When direction, spaciousness and depth are added by stereo to this high quality and range of sound, you have a startling sense of realism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ability to make clear reproductions of transient sounds is another requirement of a good stereophonic sound system. A transient is the subtle tone that lasts for but a brief moment, such as the click of a castanet, the clash of a cymbal, the twang of a guitar string or the beat of a drum. Regarding transients, Edward Canby states, in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Home Music Systems:</span><span class="font0"> “An excellent aural test for transients, by the way, is a sustained drum roll, snare drum or any smaller drum. The sharp, rapid thumps, following each other at tiny intervals, should sound as dear and distinct as they are in live music. Poor transient response in your phonograph’s innards will blur the drum tones together, sometimes so badly that individual beats disappear and we hear no more than a steady, muffled rumble. You may interpret it as a drum, roll—thanks to your imagination—especially if you know the music well; but you cannot honestly say that it sounds like a drum roll.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Needed for Stereo?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A stereophonic music system requires nearly twice as much equipment as the monophonic, nonstereo system. It requires two speakers, two amplifiers and, at present, two radio tuners. If a third speaker is used a third amplifier may be necessary. The two amplifiers are needed because two signals are used to produce the stereo effect. One is fed through the left speaker and the other through the right. These separate signals are obtained by using two or more microphones when recording the music. Each signal must be reproduced through a separate amplifier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At times stereophonic programs are broadcast over the radio by using two FM stations or, more commonly, one FM and one AM station. To receive the latter broadcast an FM radio tuner must be connected to one amplifier and an AM tuner to the other amplifier. The FM signal will then be reproduced through one speaker and the AM signal through the other speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Good equipment is needed for goodquality stereo. While it is true that you can walk into many stores and find relatively inexpensive machines that are labeled stereophonic, they will not give you the realism that a good stereophonic music system gives. The cabinet work on them may look fine, but the audio equipment in them is incapable of producing high-quality sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The stereophonic music system that gives a good illusion of realism to the music it reproduces is not cheap. The speakers alone may cost more than many of the pseudo stereo consoles with their beautiful cabinets. Good high-fidelity speakers are precision-made instruments. They might be considered the most important part of the stereophonic music system, as they do the actual reproducing of the sound waves and so determine the over-all quality of the sound. Cheaply made speakers with very light magnets cannot reproduce music with high quality and faithfulness to the original. The speaker is the most inaccurate of all the parts of the home music system, because it is not easy to design and make it so that it will vibrate well from the lowest to the highest sound. Two matched, high-quality speaker systems are what a good stereophonic system requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the best results each speaker system should have its own enclosure. This usually consists of an attractively finished box in a size recommended by the manufacturer of the speakers. There should be a back to the enclosure that is tightly screwed in place. Radio-phonograph consoles that are not true stereophonic machines generally have their speakers exposed in the back, instead of having them sealed in an enclosure that is insulated from the rest of the machine. Insulation is essential when the speakers are in the same cabinet as the phonograph pickup. It prevents vibrations from being picked up by the very sensitive stereo-phonograph stylus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By having separate speaker systems that can be moved about the room, a listener can adjust the space between them for the best stereo effect. This is usually six to ten feet in a room that is about fifteen by eighteen feet. When the speakers are placed excessively far apart the optimum listening area for the stereo effect is greatly reduced. The distance between the speakers, however, is determined by the size of the room and how far the listener sits from them. If he is so far away that the listening angle is very small, the music will lose the feeling of separation. It will fuse together and appear to come from one source. In pseudo stereo consoles the speakers are generally two to three feet apart, which is not sufficient to give a sense of space and direction unless the listener sits about three feet from the machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two amplifiers of good quality are required to operate the speaker systems. They may be two completely separate units or two amplifiers on one chassis. Whatever is used, there must be a means of coordinating the two amplifiers and the two speaker systems so volume and tone can be kept properly balanced. Some amplifiers have a phase switch so the speakers can be adjusted to operate in the same direction. If they do not, the illusion of realism is seriously affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The amplifiers should be capable of reproducing the loudest sounds of an orchestra without noticeable distortion, and they should be able to reproduce the weakest sounds against any background noise that may be present from the reproduction. They should by all means be free from loud hum. There are a number of good stereo amplifiers on the market that can be obtained from stores that handle high-fidelity components, but do not expect them to be cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The stylus of a stereo phonograph pickup moves vertically as well as in a lateral direction. This fact makes the stereo pickup much more sensitive to the manner in which record-playing equipment functions. Any noise in the turntable mechanism can be easily picked up by the stylus and mixed with the music. Since this is the case, stereo requires a good turntable that operates with very little noise, and its movement must be consistently steady, as any variation in speed will cause a change in the music. The pickup arm should be one designed for stereo because of the vertical movement of the stylus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the stylus follows the stereo record groove it moves up and down for music that goes through one amplifier and speaker, and it moves laterally for music that goes through the other amplifier and speaker. The record groove is in the shape of a V, with music for one speaker on one side of the groove and music for the other speaker on the other side. This ability of the stylus to move vertically and laterally causes it to pick up the two different signals of stereo music from a single record groove. The stereo pickup will work well on monophonic records, but this cannot be said of the nonstereo pickup with regard to a stereo record. If it is used on a stereophonic record, it will damage the record, because it is not designed to move vertically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although an FM radio tuner is not essential for a stereo music system, it is good to have, because a person may not want to play records every time he desires music. Then, too, stereo may eventually be broadcast over a single FM station. The equipment for doing this is now available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those who buy high-fidelity components can purchase one piece at a time and thus make the cost of a stereo system easier to bear. Because tbe components are usually handsomely designed, they look good in a room without an expensive cabinet to enclose them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The stereophonic home music system has been enthusiastically acclaimed by music lovers as a decided improvement over previous instruments for bringing music into the home. It is a big step toward creating concert-hall realism in the room it fills with music.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">• A young high-school student in the province of Laguna, Philippines, was determined to attend the Peace-pursuing Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Lingayen, March 24-27, I960, However, school examinations were scheduled to be held during those dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">She approached each one of her teachers and requested permission to write the examinations either before or after the assembly. Permission was refused in each case. She then approached the school principal with the same request. Again she was refused. Three times she tried, and each time the answer was “No!” The fourth time she told the principal that she was going to attend the assembly whether she was allowed to graduate or not. The principal asked what was the reason she was so determined to attend the assembly. She replied that she was a minister and attendance at the assembly constituted part of her worship of the true God. The principal asked her what she did in her capacity as a minister. Her reply was that she preached from house to house. The principal then asked for a demonstration of her preaching. She gave him one of the sermons she uses in her ministry. The principal was so impressed that he granted her permission to write her graduation examinations on her return from the assembly. —Philippines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• While a witness of Jehovah was presenting a doorstep sermon to a woman, her young son of fourteen years was listening attentively. He was so impressed that he urged his mother to get the books being offered by the Witness, but the mother refused. The boy had been saving up for a bicycle and wanted to use some of this money to get the books, but his mother would not let him do that, saying: “No, you don't want those books. You want a bicycle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The same evening this Witness was giving a sermon to an elderly lady who kept smiling all the time the Witness was speaking. Afterward she invited the Witness inside and told that her grandson had come with tears in his eyes, saying: “O Grandma, a lady had two books explaining the Bible, and I did so want to have them, but Mummie would not give me the money.” So Grandma said, “Now he can have his books.”—Ceduna, Western Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• A householder in the Philippines refused even to touch the magazine offered to her by one of Jehovah's witnesses calling at her door. As the Witness was about to leave, the woman’s small child returned from school. He asked what the magazine was about and then begged his mother to get it for him. Because she refused he kept crying until she consented. Since the child was not able to read, he persuaded his mother to read portions of the magazine to him. Although she was not interested in the material, she began to read in order to pacify the child. Among the things she read was the article, “Is Your Religion the Right One?” Thereupon she read the entire magazine, and when the Witness returned she had many questions to ask. As a result, a study was started in her home, and her husband and all the children are now attending.—Philippines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• After becoming a Witness, a fifteen-year-old girl spent her first summer vacation as a vacation pioneer minister. During the summer months she placed considerable Bible literature with the people and was able to start several Bible studies in the homes of persons of good will toward God. Upon returning to school she has been alert to give a witness to Jehovah’s name at every opportunity, and her efforts have been blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Wheh given an assignment for a four- to six-minute talk on what she did during her vacation, she gave a report on the district assembly she attended. Being required to write at times on subjects of her choice, she has used topics such as “A Day with Jehovah’s People,” &quot;Pursuing My Purpose in Ufe,” her autobiography since she became a Witness, and “Christmas Not for Christians.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font0">NIMALS have built-in tools such as beaks, daws and teeth. But occasionally some of nature’s creatures need the help of an outside agency—some implement, instrumentality or substance with which to bring about a certain objective. What does a bird do, for instance, when its bill is not long enough to flush out insects? What does the bowerbird do when it needs a paintbrush? Or the zebra when it needs a hairbrush?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There comes a time in the zebra’s life when it needs to get rid of many dead hairs, Mr. Zebra then searches for nature’s own hairbrush—sharp thornbushes. Large herds of zebras sometimes dash through these bushes several times a day. When the thorn points become blunted, the zebras find themselves new hairbrushes—bushes with thorns of unblunted sharpness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Galapagos Islands there is a bird called the woodpecker finch. It has a short, thick bill. Many insects that excite this bird’s taste buds dwell too deeply in the ground for the bird’s bill to reach them. So the woodpecker finch does an unusual thing for birds: It finds itself a tool, usually a twig. Putting this twig tool in its mouth, the bird pokes about in crevices. Soon insects come scrambling out. The tool is dropped now; and the bird, seizing the prey, enjoys a tasty meal. So a short beak is really no dinnertime hindrance to the woodpecker finch—not as long as there are any tools lying around.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Another bird, the European song thrush, has a fondness for snails. To get to the soft edible meat in the shell, the bird needs a hammerlike tool. So the song thrush takes the snail to a favorite rock and hits it against the rock until the shell is broken. Sea gulls carry on their daily business in a similar way. They dine on shellfish such as clams. To break open a clam, the sea gull does it the easy way. It uses both gravity and a hard surface as its tools. It takes the clam or other shellfish up in the air and drops it, following it down. If the shell is not broken, the gull takes the shellfish up to a higher altitude and tries again. Persistence pays off, and the sea gull enjoys a succulent snack.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">For Firsi Aid</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then there is the eider duck, a bird that really has all the equipment necessary for making a good living. But sometimes this duck gets itself in a predicament because of its taste for shellfish. In the process of putting shellfish on its menu, the eider duck sometimes is startled by a mussel’s closing its shell hard on the duck’s bill, trapping the bird in such a way that it may not be able to break the shell against a rock. The duck may well be doomed unless it can do something. But what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Says Frank Lane in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nature Parade:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Except during the breeding season an eider duck seldom, if ever, frequents fresh water. But when an eider has to get rid of a mussel it seeks out the nearest stretch of fresh water, and keeps ducking its head until the mussel drops off. Is it instinct that prompts the duck to take the only action possible—drowning the mussel— and leads it to the only water that will do it—fresh water? (Strictly speaking the ‘drowning’ is change in osmotic pressure.)” So fresh water is sometimes like a lifesaving tool to the eider duck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most famous of the tool-using birds is perhaps the bowefbird. Aside from its nest, the bowerbird builds itself a bower or playhouse of twigs, ornamenting it at or near the entrance with shells, feathers or any bright-colored object. The satin bowerbird is not satisfied, however, unless it gives its playhouse a special finishing operation, which is painting. First the paint must be made. The bird uses black earth, ashes or colored soil and mixes it with its saliva. Then the paint is applied with the aid of a bit of frayed bark, and each stick of the inside walls is painted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tools for Insects</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Insectdom has a tool user in the thread-waisted wasp. This wasp digs a hole in the sandy ground and deposits its eggs. Into the hole also are placed some insects that the wasp has killed and that will serve as food for the growing young wasps. But the tunnel has to be sealed up against marauding birds. To do this some wasps use their heads as a bulldozer, pushing in the sand. But the thread-waisted wasps of the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bphex</span><span class="font0"> prefer not to use their heads directly. They find a small pebble, put it in their mandibles and then use it to pound the loose sand in, until finally the tunnel entrance is sealed up so that the soil is as firm as the undisturbed soil around the tunnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ant lion is another insect that finds an outside substance helpful in making a living. The ant lion digs a pit in dry sand; then it hides at the bottom. The ant lion is waiting for a meal. This often requires great patience, but the ant lion has plenty of time. It waits. In due time an ant or other small creature wanders too close to the pit and falls into it. But when falling the victim tries desperately to get out of the pit. Sometimes it appears that the victim is about on the verge of escaping. Then the ant lion goes into action. It uses sand as a kind of tool to halt the escape of its intended victim. Furiously the ant lion tosses sand into the air. The falling sand frustrates the insect’s escape and it tumbles to the bottom of the pit. The captive is given an injection of poison. Time is allowed for the poison to work and to digest the victim’s body contents. Then the ant lion sucks the juices of its prey, and the shriveled-up carcass is tossed out of the pit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Crab’s Living Tools</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Indian Ocean there is a crab called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Melia tesselata</span><span class="font0"> that believes in using tools—living tools. This crab has a shell that is not exceptionally hard. Since there are many undersea raiders that would quickly make a meal of this crab, it searches about for a protective tool. And while it is in the market for a tool it believes that a two-way tool would be best, one that could aid in defense and one that could aid in capturing prey. So it finds some sea anemones, flowerlike animals with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles armed with sting cells and thread cells that paralyze and entangle small fish and marine animals. The crab puts one of these sea anemones in each of its claws, and then goes about its daily work—armed to the teeth. The sea anemones do not seem to mind being used as tools, since they benefit too. They are normally immobile, and the crab’s moving them about means more steady meals for the sea anemones themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Skunks and foxes sometimes make use of various substances when they need to doctor themselves—something to help them get rid of fleas or ants. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Animal Legends</span><span class="font0"> Maurice Burton examines strange stories about animals. He finds that accounts of foxes using water to get rid of fleas are not likely to be fanciful stories. He tells about a letter printed in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Countryside,</span><span class="font0"> the journal of the British Empire Naturalists Association, for 1947. It was from R. Atkinson of Kendal and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The following account of a fox ridding itself of fleas, which I saw by a sheer slice of good luck, will . . . dispose of the folklore theory. Standing in a farm enclosure one day with the occupier of a farm, the latter drew my attention to a fox which he had been watching for some time; field glasses were brought into use, and as only two or three hundred yards separated us, the fox could distinctly be seen gathering wool from the hawthorn fence which almost encircled the field, and on the lower branches of which strands of sheep’s wool could be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“To secure the wool the fox either reached up for it, standing on all fours, or, if it could not reach it by this means, either stood on its hind legs or jumped for it. It arranged the wool in its muzzle so that it projected two or three inches on either side; then it proceeded towards a stream of water running through the field, entered it backwards, sat down on its haunches </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">lik</span><span class="font0">e a dog, and eventually lowered itself in the water by putting out its forelegs until the whole of its body except the nostrils, and the wool held in its mouth, were submerged. The fox stopped in that position for two or three minutes, then liberated the wool slowly, left the water, shook itself vigorously and disappeared. The wool, as it was released by the fox, was carried downstream, so we went in search of it, and eventually found it lodged by the side of the stream. To our amazement it was simply alive with hen-fleas—hundreds of them. It is obvious that the fleas objected to the water, and made for the highest dry point, i.e., the wool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So the use of tools or substances in nature for doctoring purposes and for making a living is just another of the many things of which it can be said: Nature had it first!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">F</span><span class="font0">OR many people a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wild, swampy moorland is probably the last place they would think of going for fuel to heat their homes, but this is precisely what many people in Ireland do. When those who live in the country find that their fuel supply is running low they head for the family bog or for one they rent. There they proceed to dig up the wet sod that serves very well as a fuel when thoroughly dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may seem strange to say that the sod of swampy ground can be used as fuel for heating and cooking, but it is possible in Ireland, because the ground in an Irish bog consists of decayed and partly carbonized vegetable matter known generally as peat and locally as turf. The material consists chiefly of reeds, rushes, mosses, coarse grass and heather that have died and, over a period of time, have been packed down under the pressure of subsequent layers. Being insulated from oxygen by a layer of water, it gradually carbonizes as time passes and the pressure on it increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The depth to which peat in Ireland has been formed varies from one or two feet in mountainous regions to as much as thirty feet in other places. Its rate of growth may be from one to four inches a year. At great depths peat is nearly black, but it becomes increasingly lighter in shades of brown toward the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the family reaches their bog, they must first dig deep, systematic trenches across it for ' ' drainage. The top foot or two of material must be removed with a spade. An oddly shaped spade with a narrow blade is the instrument used for cutting the peat. This is what the Irish call a “slane.” The person who does the cutting marks out a straight line of peat with an ordinary</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">spade and then proceeds to cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the sod with the slane. One powerful thrust frees a sod of peat that is about two feet long and perhaps nine inches in the other dimensions. He then throws this soggy piece of sod to a catcher, who places it on a donkey-drawn cart or on a wheelbarrow. When the cart or wheelbarrow is finally stacked high with wet sod, it is taken a little distance away. There the sod is spread out on the ground to dry. When thoroughly dry it will be only about half its present size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After a week or two the sods are turned over to allow the other side to dry out. Sometimes they are stacked at this time with two sods crosswise to the two below and with the dry side down and the wet side up. After further weeks of drying these small stacks, or footings, are built up into larger stacks called “clamps.” Because the dried sods are packed tightly together in the clamps, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only the</span><span class="font0"> outer ones become wet in bad weather.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">A sight that is picturesquely a part of Ireland is a peat-laden cart being slowly pulled by a donkey along an unpaved country road. Sometimes a donkey may be seen with a large basket slung on each side of its back, with each basket loaded with dried peat. These are called “creels.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Digging by Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The approximately three million acres of bogs in Ireland cover roughly one seventh of Ireland’s surface. The problem that has long confronted Ireland is how to extract the energy locked in these bogs on a scale large enough to meet its needs. Machinery appears to be a promising answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When experiments were made in digging peat by means of machines, the results were very encouraging. They led the government in 1946 to establish an organization called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bord na Mona<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font0"> which means Peat Board. It was hoped that large-scale production of peat would help cut down on Ireland’s coal imports. That, of course, would be a boost to its economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Peat Board has been authorized to spend £19,000,000 on its projects. At present it employs approximately 7,000 workers, and expects to have an additional 2,000 when its current development program is completed. For the benefit of its employees it has thus far constructed 578 houses, with more on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first step toward cutting peat by machinery is to drain the selected bog. This is done by means of ditches that are dug by machine. The equipment used is a tractor-like device that operates a large disc on one of its sides. A series of blades attached to the disc does the digging. By means of it, along with other machines, the men dig main drains, cross drains and subdrains. The next step is to cut away the top layer of grass, heather and other vegetation as well as the recent layers of decayed matter. This too is done by machine. Now the peat is exposed and is ready to be cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A big forty-ton machine moves into place on the side of a sharply angled trench. It cuts out a portion of the bank that is about six and a half feet wide and nearly ten feet deep. This big chunk- of peat passes into a macerating compartment in the machine, where it is kneaded before being squeezed out like tooth paste on a long spreader arm. This is a very long platform that is mounted on rollers. As the peat is finally lowered to the ground, it is cut into lengths that are easily handled. During the cutting season, which begins in the spring and carries through the summer, peat-cutting machines are kept operating day and night. They produce 1,000 tons a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the peat has been deposited on the ground, it is left there from three to five weeks, depending upon weather conditions, until it is sufficiently solid to be lifted either by machine or by hand. Machines are used to gather it into windrows for further drying, for turning it over, and for collecting it and loading it into railway wagons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Milled Peat</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another machine method for digging peat is the milling method. In this process a tractor-like machine works along the surface of the bog, instead of on the side of a trench. It cuts and mills the peat to a depth of half an inch, leaving it on the ground to dry. This breaks the turf into pieces small enough to pass through a one-inch mesh screen. A machine that has an aluminum ridging blade forty feet long pushes the dry, milled peat into a long pile, and other machines deposit it into wagons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The milling process has an advantage over the sod method because the drying time is cut to a few days. The production costs are smaller, and the risk of loss from a bad season is considerably less than with the other method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The present development program of the Peat Board has an ultimate goal of four million tons of peat annually. Well over half of this will be fuel for electric generating stations. What is left over of the milled peat will go into briquettes. The first briquette factory was unable to keep up with the demand, so another one was built and now a third is on the way. The briquettes and what sod peat the power stations do not need are supplied to institutions, industry and common households.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although peat can be obtained at less cost in Ireland than coal, it has certain disadvantages. With present methods it cannot be cut all year round, but only from March to August. Elven then late frost and heavy rainfall can interfere with production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another disadvantage is the fact that peat takes up much more storage space than does coal. Thirty-five cubic feet will take a ton of coal, but the same amount of peat requires 105 cubic feet. This is due to the fact that it is not as dense as coal. Obviously, any industry that switches from coal to peat is faced with the immediate problem of storage. Perhaps further research may produce methods for compressing a ton of peat into a smaller volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the Peat Board pushes its program ‘ for mechanizing peat production, many Irish living out in the country continue to dig fuel from their bogs by the same time-worn method their forefathers used. The quaint sight of these people bringing home dried peat on the backs of donkeys or in carts continues to charm the tourists who venture out into the moorlands to see the famous bogs of Ireland, which are second only to Russia’s in the production of peat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In her millions of acres of bogs Ireland has a vast reservoir of energy that possibly could meet most of her fuel needs if the problems of production and storage could be solved. But while the Irish dig in their bogs for fuel, visitors will not cease to marvel at how energy can come from the sod of a soggy bog.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;L “When the outer layer of a leaf is stripped off and examined under a powerful lens,” write William J. Tinkle and Walter E. Lammerts in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Science and Christian Faith,</span><span class="font17"> &quot;the leaf tissue is magnified revealing its minute arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a layer of cells fitted nicely together, all having similar size and shape, and within each cell there is a smaller body called a nucleus. When a thin slice of root tip is magnified still more, using a compound microscope, one observes that the nucleus is made up of regularly shaped parts, including the rod-shaped chromosomes. The more we magnify the things of nature, the more order is revealed to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C “Such intricate structure is not characteristic of the work of man. When magnified, the edge of a sharp razor blade looks like a jagged and very irregular saw, as if a nervous man had cut out saw teeth with his eyes shut. If we look at fine printing we see irregular blobs of ink on criss-cross fibers of paper. Yet who would look at the razor blade or the piece of fine printing and deny the intelligent'planning of the man who formed them ? Such order and design as we see in nature demands a Designer.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">B</span><span class="font0">IBLE prophecies foretell that Jehovah God will rid this ear|h of all its wicked inhabitants at the rapidly approaching battle of Armageddon. According to Jesus Christ, that will mark the greatest tribulation this earth has ever seen or will ever see.—Matt. 24:21; Rev. 16:14, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not only will Armageddon rid the earth of all the wicked but it will destroy them beyond hope of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> resurrection. How can we be so certain of that? Because when Jehovah God takes action against the wicked he changes not; his judgments are irrevocable.—Mal. 3:5, 6,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus at Revelation 18:4, 5, God warns his people to get out of Babylon, Satan’s visible organization, lest they share in her sins and receive of her plagues. Since Babylon’s plagues will be eternal destruction, just as ancient Babylon was literally destroyed, never to rise again, so any who today share in the sins of Satan’s organization will also share its plagues and therefore suffer annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jude tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah underwent “the judicial punishment of everlasting fire,” or eternal destruction. Since Jesus likened the present generation to that existing at the time Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, it follows that those who perish at Armageddon will suffer the same fate as did those of Sodom and Gomorrah.—Jude 7; Luke 17:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But what about children at Armageddon? Is there any hope for these, or will tney pensn with their parents? Will they automatically be spared because they happen to have faithful parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The answers to these questions are found in the Scriptural principles of family responsibility and family merit. Until they reach the age of accountability children share the destiny of their parents. Unjust? No, merely the working out of one of God’s perfect laws. Certainly the children yet unborn, in the loins of the fathers, perish when the father does, even as the unborn babes in the wombs of the mothers perish when their mothers perish. So also with newborn babes, young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus Adam’s unborn children inherited-death from him. (Rom. 5:12) The young also died in the Deluge and in Sodom and Gomorrah because of what their parents had done. And were not even the young first-born of Egypt slain by Jehovah’s death angel because their parents had failed to sprinkle blood on the doorposts and lintels of their houses on the night of the passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The converse has also been true throughout the years. The young Israelite firstborn were spared because of what their parents did in obedience to God’s instruction on that Passover night, even as they were delivered with their parents at the Red Sea when Pharaoh’s hosts came storming after them. Logically, the same principle will apply at the battle of the great day of God the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The governing principle is stated at 1 Corinthians 7:14, where we read: “For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, your children would really be unclean, but now they are holy.” Not that unbelieving mates will be spared at Armageddon by virtue of their having believing mates, but rather that they are advantaged as to taking their stand for Jehovah God. Thus Lot’s course gave his wife an advantage, but because she herself did not obey she did not survive. As for the children, the fact that they are considered holy would indicate that the merit of the believing mate would cover them, but only until they are able to do something themselves in behalf of their salvation, at which time they would be in a position similar to that of the unbelieving mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So let not parents think that their children will receive such protection regardless of how they may rear their children. Not at all! Children to be spared at Armageddon will have to be bringing forth Christian fruits to the extent their years permit. And parents should not minimize what young children can learn and do. Newspaper reports tell of children as young as four years stealing. Surely such delinquent children will not be spared even if their own parents were heeding the command at Zephaniah 2:3 to ‘seek Jehovah, righteousness and meekness.’ Rather, the rule would apply: “Even by his practices a boy makes himself recognized as to whether his activity is pure and upright.”—Prov. 20:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If children of four years are old enough to steal and be delinquent in other respects, they are also old enough to learn about God and serving him. As soon as they begin to use words they should be taught about God and his Word, the Bible. Failure to start early with discipline is a mistaken kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This requires that the parents themselves be so fully saturated with God’s truth and spirit that they will find it a real pleasure to obey the Biblical command: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force. And these words . . . must prove to be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.”—Deut. 6:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, for children to survive Armageddon with their parents, their parents must “go on bringing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” In turn, the children must heed the instructions: “Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous: ‘Honor your father and mother’; which is the first command with a promise: ‘That it may go well with you and you may endure a long time on &quot;die earth.’ ” For those that survive Armageddon such “long time” may well be forever.—Eph. 6:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many examples could be cited showing that very young children can leam about God and serve him. Space permits giving but one. One seven-year-old lad, whose mother was studying the Bible with one of the Witnesses, demurred to hold the flag during the patriotic exercises because of what he overheard in these studies. Mother and the Witness had to come to school and explain. Later the mother asked one of the servants in her congregation if Jehovah’s witnesses refused to sing Christmas songs. Her young son had refused, causing the teacher to exclaim: “Those Jehovah’s witnesses! All they do is read the Bible!” Still, at the end of the school term this lad was cited for his exemplary behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No question about it, family merit alone will not cause children who are old enough to leam and obey to survive Armageddon. They must take in knowledge of God and Christ and serve God to the extent their years permit. They too must seek Jehovah, righteousness and meekness. They too must live for the new world now to live in it after Armageddon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">$&gt; On August 19 Russia put into orbit an earth satellite weighing over 10,000 pounds, cartying two dogs and television equipment to enable ground stations to watch their behavior. After orbiting the earth seventeen times, and traveling about 437,500 miles during a twenty-four-hour flight, the dogs were returned to the earth alive and in good condition, Soviet news agency Tass reported that “the flight into outer space and back of the space satellite ship—a creation of the genius of Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians and workers—is a forerunner of a manned space flight.” Also on August 19, a U.S- plane recovered in mid-air an 85-pound space capsule, which had been ejected from a rocKet satellite on its seventeenth revolution around the earth.</span></p>

On September 7 a group of 150 ministers and laymen, under the leadership of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale of New York, met in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington to discuss the “real and vital religious issue&quot; of the presidential campaign. It was felt that a Roman Catholic president would be under “extreme pressure from the hierarchy of his church,” since “his church insists he is duty bound to admit to its directions.” It was pointed. out that “the record of the Roman Catholic Church in many countries where it is predominant is one of denial of equal rights for all of other faiths.” “In countries such as Spain and Colombia, Protestant ministers and religious workers have been arrested, imprisoned and otherwise persecuted because of their religion.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; According to East German authorities, this year 135,000 boys and girls took vows to the State as a part of their atheistic “Youth Initiations” c e r emonies. Youth initiation rose to approximately 80 percent last year, from about 44 percent in 1958. Fifteen years ago about 80 percent received church confirmation, whereas last year only about 10 percent were confirmed. The number leaving the churches continues to increase without the East German State’s taking steps physically to prevent church attendance. A West Berlin source reveals that in the Evangelical Parish of Halle over 5,000 persons have cut off all connections with the church during each of the last two years.</span></p>

After receiving abuse necessitating hospital treatment, Dr. Menges was able to put the gang to flight with his walking stick. His comment: &quot;I have traveled alone, unarmed, all through the interior of the Caucasus, Turkey, Mongolia, Persia, amid primitive tribes supposed to be hostile to white men.

Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There were increases in every major category during the six-month period. Robberies increased 13 percent, burglaries were up 12 percent, murders rose 6. percent, rape and auto theft increased 5 percent, and aggravated assault 4 percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Sporting winds up to 150 miles an hour, hurricane Donna swept over the Caribbean, through the Forida Keys, up the middle of Florida and north along the eastern coast, leaving death and destruction in her path. According to an Associated Press count, 118 were killed in the Caribbean and 30 on the mainland. The U.S. weather chief called it “the most destructive and vicious tropical storm since Weather Bureau records were first kept in 1886.” Property damage in Florida was estimated at one billion dollars, and in the millions in the northeastern United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Childbirths During Storm</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As hurricane Donna neared Florida on September 9, expectant mothers began checking into hospitals throughout the threatened area. The American Medical Association pointed out that from similar past experienee, Florida doctors were probably well advised to expect an Increase of births during the storm. A theory held is that the low barometric pressure accompanying a hurricane could be responsible for premature labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Indian Floods</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On September 8 officials reported that so far at least 256 persons have been killed by what are described as the worst floods in recent years in India’s Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa states. Forty inches of rain fell during a two-day period in the state of Orissa. Eighty-five villages were completely washed away and more than 1,500,000 persons were left homeless. Many cattle were killed, and because of crop damage it is estimated that food production may drop by 50 percent. In the state of Punjab 1,000 villages were flooded and about 2,500 homes were wrecked, leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;§&gt; During the summer scientists headed by Jean Perrot did excavating work at Beersheba, which is forty-eight miles southwest of the old city of Jerusalem in Palestine. They claim that the inhabitants of the area had a highly developed culture on a par with the Egyptians and preceding them by many years. Their homes were built entirely underground, protecting them from the heat of the day and the cold of the night.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On September 6 Professdr Abraham I. Katsh, chairman of the Department of Hebrew Studies at New York University, said that he had uncovered manuscripts that record some original, uncensored sections of the Talmud. These manuscripts reveal that the name of Jesus appeared in the original version of the Talmud. This means that somewnere along the line censors struck out Jesus’ name, since it does not appear in the present Talmud.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">William H. Martin, 29, and Bernon F. Mitchell, 31, employees of the U.S. National Security Agency in Washington, went on vacation June 24 and finally turned up in Russia, where they have taken up Soviet citizenship. On September 6, speaking from the headquarters of the Soviet Journalists Union, they explained they were opposed to United States intelligence methods, which they feared would lead to war. Evidence indicates that the United States government is “as unscrupulous as it has accused the Soviet Government of being,” they said. The U.S. Defense Department said their statements were &quot;false- ■ hoods” and that the men are</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;toots or soviet propaganda.” President Eisenhower called them traitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching New Heights</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On August 12 Major Robert M. White of the U.S. Air Force flew the rocket ship X-15 to a record height of 131,000 feet, nearly twenty-five miles up. The previous record was 126,200 feet, set in 1956. Four days later Captain Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., of the U.<sub>(</sub>S. Air Force ascended in a balloon to over 102,800 feet, nearly nineteen and s half miles, and then jumped, plummeting sixteen miles and reaching a speed of 320 miles an hour before his parachute opened. The free fall through space lasted 4 minutes 38 seconds, and the final 17,500-foot descent after his main parachute opened took 8 minutes 30 seconds. This was the highest man has ascended in a balloon, as well as being the longest parachute jump and free fall.</span></p>

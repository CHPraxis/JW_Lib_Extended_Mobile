FIELD MINISTRY
Carefully searching the Scriptures results in promoting accurate knowledge among those who are God’s ministers. (Col. 1:9, 10) During May Jehovah’s witnesses will use accurate knowledge by witnessing to others and presenting the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained and a Bible-study booklet on a contribution of 75c. If you would like to have a share in this work, contact Jehovah’s witnesses at a nearby Kingdom Hall or write to this office.

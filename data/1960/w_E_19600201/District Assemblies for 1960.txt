District Assemblies for 1960
Each District Assembly during the course of this year will be called “Peace-pursuing District Assembly,” in accord with the 1960 yeartext. As many branches of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania as deem it advisable will arrange for one or more district assemblies in the territories under their supervision. As early as possible due announcement will be made in the Society’s official publications of the locations of these assemblies and of the dates of each of these four-day assemblies, that all those interested in attending may select the most appropriate assembly location for themselves and may make their necessary preparations. At this time we are pleased to announce the following assemblies for which the arrangements have been consummated. The list is complete for the United States, Canada and Great Britain.

FIELD MINISTRY
In the great battle for truth and righteousness The Watchtower helps one in ‘acquiring mightiness for turning the battle’ to a successful conclusion. During February a year’s subscription for this magazine will be offered for $1, with three Bible booklets given free to new subscribers. If you would like to have a share in this work, inquire at the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or write to this office.
HOPE FOR PEACE
Peace is the desire of all people, yet the nations of this world have not been able to attain it, not even within the borders of individual nations. So commonplace has violence become that many persons view it as an inevitable evil of life. But is it? Will conditions never change? For your peace of mind and assurance of future happiness send for and read the beautifully illustrated hard-bound book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. It is only 75c.

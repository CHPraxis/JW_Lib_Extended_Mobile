<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In 1865 the American Bible Union published a Revised English Version of the New Testament that was widely used by Baptists. The Executive Board of the American Baptist Publication Society in 1883 appointed a committee to prepare an improved edition of this translation. This improved edition later was published and distributed by the American Baptist Publication Society of Philadelphia. This Baptist committee correctly rejected the trinitarian spurious text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 5:7</a> as found in the King James version.—See <em>The New Testament American Bible Union Version, </em>p. 544.</p>

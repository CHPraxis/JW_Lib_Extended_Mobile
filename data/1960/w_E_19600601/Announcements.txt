FIELD MINISTRY
As workers together with the Right Shepherd Christ Jesus and his Great Shepherd Jehovah God, we know we must be ‘tending our shepherd’s flock skillfully.’ (Ps. 78:72) Throughout June extend help to “other sheep” by presenting the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained and a booklet, on a contribution of 75c.

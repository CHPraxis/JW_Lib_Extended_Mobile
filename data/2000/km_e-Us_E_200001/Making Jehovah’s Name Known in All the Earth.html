<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When Jesus commissioned his disciples to be witnesses “to the most distant part of the earth,” he had already set the example for them to follow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) Whenever and wherever he found people, he talked about God’s purpose for humankind. In imitation of Jesus, the faithful slave class is using a great variety of ways to make Jehovah’s name “known in all the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:12:4-23:12:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 12:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>What Was Done in Former Days: </strong>In years gone by, sermons were published in newspapers; the “Photo-Drama of Creation” was produced and shown to millions; sound cars were used; and extensive use was made of the phonograph and, for a time, radio​—all to preach the good news. Of course, primary emphasis has always been placed on making personal contact with people so that the interest found can be cultivated. Consequently, the house-to-house ministry has proved to be a very effective means of making Jehovah’s name known everywhere.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 5:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>What Is Being Done in Our Day: </strong>With changing times the world is moving at a hectic pace, and in many places people are seldom found at home. Few are inclined to spend time reading and meditating on spiritual things. We must therefore adapt our ministry accordingly. In addition to continually covering the territory from house to house, we have been encouraged to go where the people are and to be “always ready” to make a defense for the hope within us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) This means endeavoring to preach to workmates, to schoolmates, to people on the street and in the park or parking lot, from store to store, and anywhere else that people may be found. Having Jehovah’s backing, our efforts meet with good success. Are you having a share in reaching people wherever they are?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>May we individually leave no stone unturned when it comes to making Jehovah’s name known in our territory. We can find great satisfaction in fully accomplishing our ministry, as we look to Jehovah to draw righthearted ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>.</p>

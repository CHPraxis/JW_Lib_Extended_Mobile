<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>Any 192-page book published prior to 1986 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>Individual copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Have <em>Require </em>brochure available for interested people, and endeavor to start home Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ All baptized publishers present at the Service Meeting the week of January 10 may obtain the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the Identity Card for their children.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “The Real Armageddon​—Why? When?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 19, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion, allowing time to greet visitors and encourage newly interested ones. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 2000 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 16. The subject of the talk will be “Why Mankind Needs a Ransom.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 16, 2000.</p>

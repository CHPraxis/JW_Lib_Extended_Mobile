<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101984127/">Song 107</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Local announcements. Selected Announcements from <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:202000000/">Making Jehovah’s Name Known in All the Earth</a>.” Question-and-answer discussion. Include comments on informal witnessing from <em>Our Ministry </em>book, pages 93-4.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Making a Legal Choice for Nonblood Management of Health Care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) Talk by a qualified elder, based on question-and-answer guide that accompanies the Society’s health-care durable power of attorney, or proxy, form and the sheet entitled “Information About the Society’s Health-Care Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Forms,” both dated January 1997. Following this meeting, baptized Witnesses may obtain a new Advance Medical Directive/​Release card, and those with unbaptized minor children may receive an Identity Card for each child. These cards are not to be filled out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home but NOT signed. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done after the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Before signing, be sure that the cards are filled out completely. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. By adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive to use for themselves and their children. The durable power of attorney, or proxy, form has been prepared by the Society and is a more comprehensive health-care document that provides primary legal protection. Witnesses who have not already filled out this form and who wish to do so can obtain a copy from the congregation secretary. (If a publisher has moved to another state, he would need to execute a new form in order for it to be effective in that state.) Additionally, if a durable power of attorney, or proxy, form has been executed, you should write on the front of the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card, preferably in your own hand: “I have also executed a health-care power of attorney.” Book study conductors should be sure that all assigned to their group have the assistance they desire to fill out the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and durable power of attorney, or proxy, form. For the best possible legal protection, <em>both </em>documents should be filled out.</p>

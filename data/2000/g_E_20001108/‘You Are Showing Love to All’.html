<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THESE words of commendation were written to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Yugoslavia, a land where people of different ethnic backgrounds have been fighting one another for centuries. The letter stated:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Sirs,</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I had heard much about you Jehovah’s Witnesses in my hometown, Sarajevo, but I was never interested in what you believe until last summer when I had the opportunity to attend your convention in Germany. I was deeply impressed to see people from Croatia, Yugoslavia, and Bosnia peacefully sitting together and even calling one another brother and sister. I have never seen anything like that! Your mutual love gives strong evidence that politics can do nothing to you. May God bless you for the love you are showing to all!”</p>

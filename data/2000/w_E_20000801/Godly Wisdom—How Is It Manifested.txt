Godly Wisdom—How Is It Manifested?
“THE wisdom of the needy one is despised, and his words are not listened to.” With these words, wise King Solomon concluded the story of a lowly but wise man who saved an entire city from destruction. Sadly, though, “no man remembered that needy man.”—Ecclesiastes 9:14-16.
Humans tend to look down on people of little means, even if these poor ones have performed noble deeds. This was true in Jesus’ case. Isaiah prophesied about him: “He was despised and was avoided by men, a man meant for pains and for having acquaintance with sickness.” (Isaiah 53:3) Jesus was despised by some simply because he did not have the status or prominence of the leaders of his day. Yet, he possessed wisdom that was far greater than that of any sinful human. People in Jesus’ hometown refused to acknowledge that this “carpenter’s son” manifested such wisdom and performed such powerful works. That, however, was a serious mistake, for the account goes on to say that Jesus “did not do many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.” What a loss for those people!—Matthew 13:54-58.
May we not make the same mistake. “Wisdom is proved righteous by its works,” said Jesus. Those who are doing God’s work and imparting heavenly wisdom are distinguished, not by their status or social standing, but by the “fine fruit” they manifest—their Bible-based faith and deeds.—Matthew 7:18-20; 11:19.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN a fire consumed their home in Trinidad, the Bartholomew family lost everything except their lives. A relative living nearby was able to take them in, but that did not end the story.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Olive Bartholomew is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and members of the congregation in which she serves​—as well as those in surrounding areas—​began making contributions toward rebuilding the house that she and her family lost. A committee was set up to oversee the rebuilding project, and construction began. About 20 Witnesses, along with some neighbors, were on the scene. Even youths joined in, while others were on hand to offer refreshments.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“My family is overwhelmed,” said Olive, as reported in Trinidad’s <em>Sunday Guardian. </em>“They are not Witnesses, and my husband is still in shock at what he is seeing.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In summarizing the effort, the coordinator of the construction project stressed that such acts are truly identifying marks of true Christianity. “We don’t just go from home to home talking about love,” he stated. “We are trying to practice what we preach.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>.</p>

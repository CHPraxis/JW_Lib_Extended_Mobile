The Theocratic Ministry School for 2001
1 There are ample Scriptural reasons why all of us should participate as fully as possible in the Theocratic Ministry School.​—Prov. 15:23; Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 15:32; 1 Tim. 4:12, 13; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Pet. 3:15.
2 A program for weekly Bible reading has long been a feature of the school. It amounts to reading about one page of the Bible each day. Beginning this year, a Bible reading is also assigned for each written review week. The supplemental Bible reading, which was scheduled for the past three years, has been completed. But if you wish to read more of the Bible than is scheduled, you may make up your own reading program.
3 Assignment No. 2 trains brothers for “public reading” of God’s Word. (1 Tim. 4:13) When you have a reading assignment, practice it aloud again and again. You might use the Society’s audiocassette recordings of the Bible to improve your pronunciation, modulation, and other aspects of good reading.
4 Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 are based on the Reasoning book, which was prepared for use in the field ministry. If the assigned material is more than you can consider within the allotted time, select only what will be most practical for your congregation territory. Any setting that is appropriate for your territory may be used.
5 Make every reasonable effort to fulfill all your assignments in the school. Take the time to prepare well, and speak from your heart. You will be a source of encouragement to the congregation, and you will benefit personally by participating wholeheartedly in the Theocratic Ministry School during 2001.

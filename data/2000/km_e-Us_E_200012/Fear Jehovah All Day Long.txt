Fear Jehovah All Day Long
1 “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (Ps. 111:10) It stimulates us to do good works and helps us to turn away from what is bad. (Prov. 16:6) This fear is a profound reverence for our Creator, moving us to shun displeasing and disobeying him. It is something that we need to cultivate and display all day long.​—Prov. 8:13.
2 Every day, the spirit of Satan’s world exerts tremendous pressure on us to conform to its evil ways. (Eph. 6:11, 12) Our imperfect flesh is sinful and naturally tends toward what is bad. (Gal. 5:17) Hence, to obey Jehovah’s commandments, be happy, and gain life, we have to fear him all day long.​—Deut. 10:12, 13.
3 At Hebrews 10:24, 25, we are admonished to gather together so as to encourage one another “all the more so” during these times in which we live. Regular meeting attendance is vital if we are to survive these last days. Our fear of displeasing God moves us to attend meetings and value their purpose highly. Those who fear God view sharing in Christian meetings as a sacred privilege.
4 Obeying the command to preach the good news of the Kingdom is another way that we display our fear of God. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 10:42) A primary goal of our preaching work is to help others cultivate the fear of Jehovah and submit to his will. We accomplish this by making return visits, endeavoring to start home Bible studies, and then teaching others all the commandments of God. We thereby demonstrate our fear of Jehovah and our love of neighbor.​—Matt. 22:37-39.
5 Those not fearing God fail to develop an appreciative attitude toward spiritual things, and they succumb to the world’s deadly air, or mental attitude. (Eph. 2:2) May our firm resolve be to “render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.” (Heb. 12:28) We will thus reap the blessings of those who fear Jehovah all day long.

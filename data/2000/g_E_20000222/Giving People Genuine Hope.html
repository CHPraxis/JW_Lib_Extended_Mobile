<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 17-YEAR-OLD youth from the former Soviet republic of Moldova wrote to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses there to express appreciation for the September 8, 1998, <em>Awake! </em>cover series “What Hope for Today’s Youths?” The writer explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I could hardly suppress my tears, and I simply had to write to thank you. The articles made me recall feelings that I had a short time ago. When I was about to commit suicide, Jehovah’s Witnesses saved me, without their realizing it. Talking to them about hope for the future and strengthening my confidence in the Creator’s mercy helped me recover little by little from a state of despair. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Your helping people to learn about God’s purpose to bring better living conditions is a true manifestation of love toward your neighbor. It is evident that these efforts are not without results. Your efforts in highlighting the most important problems of society are praiseworthy. Keep on doing this useful work. I will be waiting for each new issue of this magazine.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the paragraph “Why <em>Awake! </em>Is Published,” which appears on page 4 of every issue, it says: “This magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.” The Bible-based promise of God has given millions of people around the earth strength to face the problems of these troublesome times.</p>

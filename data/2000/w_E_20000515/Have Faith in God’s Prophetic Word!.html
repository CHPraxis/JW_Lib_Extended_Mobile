<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">JEHOVAH was the Source of the first prophecy ever recorded. After Adam and Eve sinned, God told the serpent: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:14-1:3:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>) Centuries would pass before those prophetic words were fully understood.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>That first prophecy held out real hope for sinful mankind.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Unlike his father, godly Abel exercised faith in the first prophecy. Abel evidently realized that the shedding of blood would be needed to cover sin. Faith therefore moved him to offer an animal sacrifice that proved acceptable to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:2-1:4:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 4:2-4</a>) Yet, the identity of the promised Seed remained a mystery.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4. God gave Abraham what promise, and what did it indicate regarding the promised Seed?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Some 2,000 years after Abel’s day, Jehovah gave the patriarch Abraham this prophetic promise: “I shall surely bless you and I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens . . . And by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>) Those words linked Abraham with the fulfillment of the first prophecy.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:8-62:3:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 3:8</a>) “Because of the promise of God [Abraham] did not waver in a lack of faith” and neither did other pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah who “did not get the fulfillment of the promise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:4:20-45:4:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 4:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:39-58:11:39" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:39</a>) Instead, they maintained faith in God’s prophetic word.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The apostle Paul identified God’s promised Seed when he wrote: “The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It says, not: ‘And to seeds,’ as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one: ‘And to your seed,’ who is Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16</a>) The Seed through whom the nations were to bless themselves did not include all of Abraham’s offspring.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The prophet Daniel recorded a vital Messianic prophecy. In the first year of Darius the Mede, he realized that Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation was near its end.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Faith in God’s prophetic word makes it possible for us to identify the Messiah. Of the many Messianic prophecies recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, a number were directly applied to Jesus by writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures. To illustrate: Jesus was born of a virgin in Bethlehem.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>In the first year of Babylonian King Belshazzar, Jehovah granted his prophet Daniel a dream and remarkable visions. The prophet first saw four huge beasts. God’s angel identified them as “four kings,” thus indicating that they symbolized successive world powers.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>What are the prospects of loyal supporters of the anointed? They too have faith in <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>God’s prophetic word, and their hope rests on entering the earthly Paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:39-42:23:43" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 23:39-43</a>) There they will drink from a life-sustaining “river of water of life” and will find healing from “the leaves of the trees” planted alongside it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 22:1, 2</a>) If you have such a wonderful hope, may you continue to demonstrate deep love for Jehovah and faith in his prophetic word. May you be among those who experience the unbounded joy of everlasting life in the Paradise earth.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. Life in the earthly Paradise will include what blessings?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Imperfect humans are at a loss to describe life in the coming earthly Paradise, but God’s prophetic word gives us insight into the blessings then in store for obedient mankind. When God’s Kingdom rules unopposed and his will is done on earth as it is in heaven, no vicious humans<wbr />—no, not even animals—<wbr />will “do any harm or cause any ruin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) The meek will inhabit the earth, and “they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>) Starving masses will not exist, for “there will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>) No longer will tears of sorrow be shed. Sickness will be gone, and even death will be no more. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:4</a>) Can you imagine<wbr />—no doctors, no medicines, no hospitals or mental institutions, no funerals. What splendid prospects!</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18. (a) Of what was Daniel given assurance? (b) What will be Daniel’s “lot”?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Even the common grave of mankind will be emptied as deaths give way to resurrections. The righteous man Job had such a hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:14-18:14:15" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) So did the prophet Daniel, for Jehovah’s angel gave him the comforting assurance: “As for you yourself, go toward the end; and you will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:13-27:12:13" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Daniel 12:13</a>) Daniel served God faithfully until the end of his life. Now he is resting in death, but he will “stand up” in “the resurrection of the righteous ones” during Christ’s Millennial Reign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:14:14-42:14:14" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Luke 14:14</a>) What will be Daniel’s “lot”? Well, in its Paradise fulfillment, Ezekiel’s prophecy suggests that all of Jehovah’s people will have a place, even the land being apportioned in a just and orderly way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:47:13-26:48:35" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ezekiel 47:13–48:35</a>) So Daniel will have a place in Paradise, but his lot there will involve more than land. It will include his place in Jehovah’s purpose.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">19. What is required for life in the earthly Paradise?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>What about you and your lot? If you have faith in God’s Word, the Bible, very likely you yearn for life in the earthly Paradise. You may even imagine yourself there, enjoying its many blessings, caring for the earth, and joyfully welcoming back the dead. After all, Paradise is where mankind belongs. God created the first human pair to live in such a place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:7-1:2:9" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7-9</a>) And he wants obedient humans to live forever in Paradise. Will you act in accord with the Scriptures so that you can be among the billions who will eventually live on the Paradise earth? You can be there if you have true love for our heavenly Father, Jehovah, and enduring faith in God’s prophetic word.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In describing the real-life experience of Jesus’ disciples as they struggled to cross the Sea of Galilee in a boat, the Gospel writer Mark says that they were “hard put to it in their rowing, for the wind was against them.” While still on the shore, Jesus saw their plight and miraculously walked on the sea to reach them. When he got up into the boat with them, the wind abated.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:6:48-41:6:51" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 6:48-51</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The same Bible writer reported that on an earlier occasion, a “violent windstorm broke out.” At that, Jesus “rebuked the wind . . . , and the wind abated, and a great calm set in.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:4:37-41:4:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 4:37-39</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Although we today are not privileged to witness such miraculous events, we can learn much from them. As imperfect humans living in perilous times, we are not immune to the winds of adversity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) In fact, at times we may feel that the distress associated with personal trials reaches windstorm intensity. But relief is available! Jesus extends the invitation: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:28-40:11:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When it appears that ‘the winds are against us,’ we can experience “a great calm” of heart. How? By trusting in Jehovah God’s unfailing promises.<wbr />—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:9-23:55:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:5-50:4:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:5-7</a>.</p>

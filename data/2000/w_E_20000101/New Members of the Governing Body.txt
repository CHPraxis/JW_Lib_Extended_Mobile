ON Saturday, October 2, 1999, the Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was concluded with a surprise announcement. The 10,594 in attendance or connected by tie line were thrilled to hear that four new members had been added to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The new members, all anointed Christians, are Samuel F. Herd; M. Stephen Lett; Guy H. Pierce; and David H. Splane.

Thereafter, he and his wife, Gloria, have been part of the United States Bethel family, where Brother Herd has been working in the Service Department. He was also serving as a helper to the Service Committee.

Since April 1998, he and Susan have been part of the United States Bethel family. There he has worked in the Service Department and was a helper to the Teaching Committee.
• Guy Pierce raised a family and then with his wife started pioneering in April 1982. He served as a circuit overseer from 1986 until 1997, when he and his wife, Penny, became part of the United States Bethel family. Brother Pierce had been serving as a helper to the Personnel Committee.

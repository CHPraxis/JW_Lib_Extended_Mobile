Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: Distribution of Kingdom News No. 36 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each dwelling with a copy of Kingdom News No. 36 may offer the Require brochure or the Knowledge book. If people already have these, either the Live Forever book or the Creation book may be used. December: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life with the New World Translation. January: Any 192-page book published in or prior to 1986 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that have on hand Mankind’s Search for God may also offer it. February: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!, or any older 192-page book that the congregation has in stock.
▪ After the Kingdom News campaign is completed, congregations that still have a supply of Kingdom News No. 36 may encourage publishers to offer these in the same manner that they offer tracts​—both from door to door and elsewhere. If advisable, publishers may leave one at each not-at-home, making sure that it cannot be seen by passersby. Efforts should be made to distribute all remaining copies of this important message.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2001 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their November literature request. The Yearbook will be available in Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the Yearbook is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Yearbooks are special-request items.

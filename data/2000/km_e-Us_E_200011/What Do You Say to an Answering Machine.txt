What Do You Say to an Answering Machine?
The telephone is an effective means of witnessing to people who cannot be found at home or who live in territories that are inaccessible. However, more and more people do not answer the phone​—an answering machine does it for them. When this happens, what can you do? Do not hang up. Instead, have a well-prepared response written out that you can read over the phone. Practice doing so in a pleasant, conversational voice. What can you say?
You could extend a warm invitation to the householder to attend the next Public Meeting at the Kingdom Hall. You might say: “I am sorry that I did not find you at home. If you would like to hear a Bible-based discussion of [title of public talk], please come to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The public is invited. No collections are ever taken.” Then state clearly the day and time of the meeting, and give the street address or describe the location of the Kingdom Hall.
Be alert to any new ones who may attend the meetings, introduce yourself to them, and make them feel welcome. Do not forget to offer a free home Bible study!

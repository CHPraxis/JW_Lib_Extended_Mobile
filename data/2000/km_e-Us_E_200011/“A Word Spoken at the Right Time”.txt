“A Word Spoken at the Right Time”
1 Is sharing the message of life with others a challenge for you? Do you feel that you must say something profound to impress your listeners? When Jesus sent forth his disciples, he told them: “As you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’” (Matt. 10:7) The message was uncomplicated and easy to share. It is no different today.
2 Often just a few words are needed to start a conversation. When Philip met the Ethiopian eunuch, he asked him: “Do you actually know what you are reading?” (Acts 8:30) What a rewarding discussion resulted from “a word spoken at the right time”!​—Prov. 25:11.
3 You can use a similar approach in your ministry. How? By being observant and choosing words that are appropriate to the circumstances. Ask a question, and listen to the response.
4 Some Basic Questions: To initiate a conversation, you might try any of these questions:
▪ “Do you use the Lord’s Prayer (or, Our Father) in your worship?” (Matt. 6:9, 10) Recite a portion, and then state: “Some people ask, ‘What is God’s name that Jesus said is to be sanctified (or, hallowed)?’ Others ask, ‘What is the Kingdom for which Jesus said we should pray?’ Have you found satisfying answers to these questions?”
▪ “Have you ever wondered: ‘What is the meaning of life?’” Show that it relates to a knowledge of God.​—Eccl. 12:13; John 17:3.
▪ “Do you think that death will ever be done away with?” Use Isaiah 25:8 and Revelation 21:4 to give a trustworthy answer.
▪ “Is there a simple solution to the turmoil in the world?” Show that God teaches “love your neighbor.”​—Matt. 22:39.
▪ “Will a cosmic disaster destroy our earth someday?” Share the Bible promise that the earth will remain forever.​—Ps. 104:5.
5 Present the good news in a simple, direct manner and with a kind approach. Jehovah will bless your efforts to share even “a word” of the truth with others.

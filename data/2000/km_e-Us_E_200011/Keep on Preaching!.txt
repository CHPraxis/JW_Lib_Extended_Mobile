Keep on Preaching!
1 It is God’s will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) For this reason, he has given us the assignment to preach the good news. (Matt. 24:14) If we appreciate why we should keep on preaching, any discouragement or potential distraction that comes our way will not deter us.
2 Why Persist? There are many distractions in the world that cause people to forget or to take lightly what we tell them. So we must keep reminding them of God’s message of salvation. (Matt. 24:38, 39) Additionally, circumstances in the lives of people are always changing. Even world conditions can change drastically overnight. (1 Cor. 7:31) Tomorrow, next week, or next month, the people to whom we preach may face new problems or concerns that cause them to give serious consideration to the good news that we bring them. Are you not thankful that the Witness who brought you the truth was persistent?
3 To Imitate God’s Mercy: Jehovah has patiently allowed time to pass before executing judgment on the wicked. Through us he has continued to appeal to righthearted ones to turn to him and get saved. (2 Pet. 3:9) We would be bloodguilty if we did not keep God’s merciful message before the people and warn them about the coming execution of God’s judgment on all who do not turn away from their bad ways. (Ezek. 33:1-11) Even though our preaching is not always well received, we must never slack off from making every effort to help sincere ones appreciate God’s great mercy.​—Acts 20:26, 27; Rom. 12:11.
4 To Demonstrate Our Love: It is Jehovah God, through Jesus Christ, who commanded that the good news be preached in all the earth. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Even when people refuse to listen, we have an opportunity to show our love and devotion to God by persisting in doing what is right.​—1 John 5:3.
5 May we be determined to keep on preaching! Let us do so zealously while it is yet Jehovah’s “day of salvation.”​—2 Cor. 6:2.

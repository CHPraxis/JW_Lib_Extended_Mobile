<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>November: </strong>Distribution of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 36 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each dwelling with a copy of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 36 may offer the <em>Require </em>brochure or the <em>Knowledge </em>book. If people already have these, either the <em>Live Forever </em>book or the <em>Creation </em>book may be used. <strong>December: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>with the <em>New World Translation. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any 192-page book published in or prior to 1986 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that have on hand <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>may also offer it. <strong>February: </strong><em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!, </em>or any older 192-page book that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ After the <em>Kingdom News </em>campaign is completed, congregations that still have a supply of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 36 may encourage publishers to offer these in the same manner that they offer tracts​—both from door to door and elsewhere. If advisable, publishers may leave one at each not-at-home, making sure that it cannot be seen by passersby. Efforts should be made to distribute all remaining copies of this important message.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>

“Most University Textbooks Aren’t as Accurate”
That was part of one man’s assessment of the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Sydney, Australia, placed this book with him. That evening the Witness found the following message on her answering machine:
“I spoke to you this morning. I’m halfway through reading the book you left with me—“Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?” I called because I was stunned to see how up-to-date and accurate that book is about the beginning of the universe. It covers the same ground as the book I showed you . . .
“Your book is so accurate and up-to-date! Most university textbooks aren’t as accurate. It mentions the four fundamental physical forces—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. These are very current findings and very up-to-the-minute. Talk to you next week. Good-bye.”

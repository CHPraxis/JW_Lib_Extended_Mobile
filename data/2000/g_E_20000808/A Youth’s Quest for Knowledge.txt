A Youth’s Quest for Knowledge
A 16-year-old high-school student in the Czech Republic wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Prague the following letter of appreciation.
“By chance I came in touch with your magazine Awake! I do not know how long it has been affecting this big world, but I think its public acceptance must be enormous. At first glance it is astonishing how much information and how many facts are included in the articles. The true stories and the counsel that Awake! contains open the eyes of one who is not acquainted with everyday problems and risks.
“I admire the magazine not only because it is so instructive but also because it has a bird’s-eye view with respect to peoples and races. . . . By this letter I would like to express how important your endeavor to write for us is. I thank you on behalf of all readers who, like myself, admire your work. Please send me further issues of your magazine Awake! . . . Please also send me the brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?”

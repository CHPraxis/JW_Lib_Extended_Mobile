<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">1, 2. What does the “beloved one” plant, but how does it prove disappointing?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">“FOR exquisite beauty of language and consummate skill in effective communication, this parable is virtually peerless.” So said one Bible commentator referring to the opening verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:1-23:5:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 5</a>. More than simply a work of art, Isaiah’s words paint a touching portrait of the loving care that Jehovah has for his people. At the same time, these words warn us against things that displease him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Isaiah’s parable begins: <strong><em>“Let me sing, please, to my beloved one a song of my loved one concerning his vineyard. There was a vineyard that my beloved one came to have on a fruitful hillside.</em></strong> <strong><em>And he proceeded to dig it up and to rid it of stones and to plant it with a choice red vine, and to build a tower in the middle of it. And there was also a winepress that he hewed out in it. And he kept hoping for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:1-23:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 5:1,</em></strong> <strong><em>2</em></strong></a><strong><em>;</em></strong> compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:1-41:12:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 12:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Whether Isaiah literally sings this parable to his listeners or not, it surely captures their attention. Most are <span id="page74" class="pageNum" data-no="74" data-before-text="74"></span>probably familiar with the work of planting a vineyard, and Isaiah’s description is vivid and realistic. Like vine growers today, the vineyard owner plants, not grape seeds, but a “choice,” or rich, “red vine”​—a cutting or shoot from another vine. Appropriately, he plants this vineyard “on a fruitful hillside,” a place where a vineyard will thrive.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>It takes hard work to make a vineyard produce. Isaiah describes the owner’s ‘digging the land and ridding it of stones’​—tedious, exhausting work! He likely uses the larger stones “to build a tower.” In ancient times such towers served as stations for watchmen who guarded the crops against thieves and animals.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Also, he builds a stone wall to line the vineyard terraces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:5-23:5:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 5:5</a>) This was commonly done to prevent the washing away of vital topsoil.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Having worked so hard to protect his vineyard, the owner has every right to expect that it will bear fruit. In anticipation of this, he hews out a winepress. But does the hoped-for harvest materialize? No, the vineyard produces wild grapes.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Isaiah calls Jehovah, the owner of the vineyard, “my loved one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:1-23:5:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 5:1</a>) Isaiah can speak of God in such an intimate way only because he has a close relationship with Him.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Jehovah “planted” his nation in the land of Canaan and gave them his laws and regulations, which served as a wall to protect them from being corrupted by other nations.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">10. What parable involving a vineyard did Jesus give?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Jesus may have had Isaiah’s words in mind when he gave the parable of the murderous cultivators: “There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad.” Unhappily, the cultivators betrayed the vineyard owner, even killing his son. Jesus went on to show that this parable involved more than just literal Israel when he said: <span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>“The kingdom of God will be taken from you [fleshly Israel] and be given to a nation producing its fruits.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:33-40:21:41" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 21:33-41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 43</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>That new “nation” proved to be “the Israel of God”​—a spiritual nation of anointed Christians totaling 144,000.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Therefore, Isaiah’s condemnation of Judah applies today to Christendom. A study of her history​—her wars, her crusades, her Inquisitions—​reveals just how sour her fruit has been! Nevertheless, the true vineyard of anointed Christians and their “great crowd” companions must heed Isaiah’s words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>) If they are to please the vineyard’s owner, they must, individually and as a group, produce fruits that please him.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Having gone to extraordinary lengths to nurture and cultivate his vineyard, Jehovah rightfully expects it <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>to become “a vineyard of foaming wine!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:2-23:27:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 27:2</a>) However, instead of producing usable fruit, it produces “wild grapes,” literally “stinking things” or “putrid (rotten) berries.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:2-23:5:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 5:2</a>; footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:21-24:2:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) Therefore, Jehovah declares that he will remove his protective “hedge” from around the nation. The nation will be ‘set as a thing destroyed’ and will experience abandonment and drought. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:6-23:5:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 5:6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Moses had warned that they would undergo such things if they disobeyed God’s Law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:17-5:11:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 11:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:63-5:28:64" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 28:63, 64;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:29:22-5:29:23" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 29:22, 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>God expects the nation to produce good fruits. Isaiah’s contemporary Micah declares: “What is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Micah 6:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:9-38:7:9" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Zechariah 7:9</a>) However, the nation fails to heed Jehovah’s exhortation. <strong><em>“</em>[<em>God</em>] <em>kept hoping for judgment, but, look! the breaking of law; for righteousness, but, look! an outcry.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:7-23:5:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 5:7b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Moses predicted that the unfaithful nation would produce poisonous grapes from “the vine of Sodom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:32-5:32:32" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>) Likely, then, sexual immorality, including homosexuality, is part of their deviation from God’s Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:22-3:18:22" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:22</a>) The expression “breaking of law” can also be rendered “outpouring of blood.” Such brutal treatment has no doubt resulted in “an outcry” from mistreated ones​—an outcry that has reached the ears of the Planter of the vineyard.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:28-18:34:28" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 34:28</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:1-59:2:4" data-bid="32-1" class="b">James 2:1-4</a>) It is particularly important that those serving in positions of oversight ‘do nothing according to a biased leaning,’ always seeking to hear both sides of a matter before making judgment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:21-54:5:21" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Proverbs 18:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>“Revelries,” or “wild parties,” were also a problem among some Christians in the first century. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:21-48:5:21" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Galatians 5:21</a>; <em>Byington; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:13-61:2:13" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:13</a>) So it is not surprising that some dedicated Christians today have shown poor judgment when it comes to social gatherings. Unrestrained use of alcoholic beverages has caused some to become loud and boisterous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:1-20:20:1" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:1</a>) There have even been those who behaved immorally under the influence of excessive alcohol, and some gatherings have been allowed to go on virtually all night, interfering with Christian activities the next day.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Balanced Christians, however, produce godly fruit and exercise restraint and moderation in their choice of recreation. They heed Paul’s advice found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:13-45:13:13" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Romans 13:13</a>: “As in the daytime let us walk decently, not in revelries and drunken bouts.”</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Hear now Isaiah’s third and fourth woes: <strong><em>“Woe to those drawing error with ropes of untruth, and as with wagon cords sin;</em></strong> <strong><em>those who are saying: ‘Let his work hasten; do let it come quickly, in order that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!’</em></strong> <strong><em>Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness, those who are putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:18-23:5:20" data-bid="55-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 5:18-20</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

They are attached to sin the way draft animals are tied to wagons. These sinners do not fear any coming day of judgment. Mockingly they say: “Let [God’s work] come quickly!” Rather than submitting to God’s Law, they twist things, declaring that “good is bad and bad is good.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:15-24:6:15" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:7" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:3-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">27. How can Christians today avoid an attitude like that of the Israelites?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Christians today must avoid such an attitude at all costs. For example, they refuse to embrace the world’s view of fornication and homosexuality as acceptable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:18-49:4:19" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:18, 19</a>) True, a Christian might ‘take a false step’ that could lead to committing a serious sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1</a>) The elders in the congregation are ready to <span id="page84" class="pageNum" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>help those who have fallen and need assistance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="59-1" class="b">James 5:14, 15</a>) With the aid of prayers and Bible-based counsel, spiritual recovery is possible. Otherwise, there is the danger of becoming “a slave of sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:34-43:8:34" data-bid="60-1" class="b">John 8:34</a>) Rather than mocking God and losing awareness of the coming day of judgment, Christians strive to remain “spotless and unblemished” before Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:14-61:3:14" data-bid="61-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:8" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">28. What sins are condemned in Isaiah’s final woes, and how can Christians today avoid such sins?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>Appropriately, Isaiah adds these final woes: <strong><em>“Woe to those wise in their own eyes and discreet even in front of their own faces!</em></strong> <strong><em>Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine, and to the men with vital energy for mixing intoxicating liquor,</em></strong> <strong><em>those who are pronouncing the wicked one righteous in consideration of a bribe, and who take away even the righteousness of the righteous one from him!” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:21-23:5:23" data-bid="62-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 5:21</em></strong><strong><em>-23</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>These words were evidently addressed to those serving as judges in the land. Congregation elders today avoid seeming “wise in their own eyes.” They humbly accept counsel from fellow elders and adhere closely to organizational instructions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:5" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) They are moderate in their use of alcoholic beverages, never indulging before carrying out congregation responsibilities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:11-28:4:11" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Hosea 4:11</a>) Elders also avoid giving even the appearance of showing favoritism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:9-59:2:9" data-bid="65-1" class="b">James 2:9</a>) How different from the clergy of Christendom! Many of these whitewash the influential and wealthy sinners in their midst, in direct contrast to the apostle Paul’s warnings at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:18-45:1:18" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Romans 1:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:26-45:1:27" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="66-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:5" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>.</p>

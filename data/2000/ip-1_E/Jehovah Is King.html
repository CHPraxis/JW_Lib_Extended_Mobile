<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">BABYLON, Philistia, Moab, Syria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Edom, Tyre, Assyria​—all will experience Jehovah’s wrath. Isaiah has foretold the calamities that will befall these hostile nations and cities. What, though, of Judah? Will the inhabitants of Judah be exempt from punishment for their sinful ways? The historical record answers with a resounding no!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Consider what happened to Samaria, the capital of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. That nation did not keep its covenant with God. It did not keep separate from the lewd practices of the nations round about. Instead, the inhabitants of Samaria “kept doing bad things to offend Jehovah . . . Therefore Jehovah got very incensed against Israel, so that he removed them from his sight.” Forcibly removed from its land, “Israel went off its own soil into exile in Assyria.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:9-12:17:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 17:9-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:16-12:17:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16-18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:23-12:17:23" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:12-28:4:14" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Hosea 4:12-14</a>) What happened to Israel bodes ill for her sister kingdom, Judah.</p>

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:37-58:11:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:37</a>.)

Hence, Jehovah declares: “Here I am bringing a calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, of which if anyone hears both his ears will tingle. . . . I shall simply wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes the handleless bowl clean, wiping it clean and turning it upside down.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Like a bowl that is turned upside down, allowing all its contents to spill out, the land will be emptied of its human inhabitants. This coming desolation of Judah and Jerusalem is again the subject of prophecy by Isaiah. He begins: <strong><em>“Look!

Most of the Jewish survivors are taken captive to Babylon, and the few left behind flee to Egypt. Thus the land of Judah is wrecked and completely depopulated. Not even domestic animals remain. The deserted land becomes a wilderness with dreary ruins inhabited only by wild beasts and birds.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In order that there be no misunderstanding, Isaiah describes the completeness of this coming disaster and explains the reason for it: <strong><em>“The land has gone to mourning, has faded away. The productive land has withered, has faded away. The high ones of the people of the land have withered.</em></strong> <strong><em>And the very land has been polluted under its inhabitants, for they have bypassed the laws, changed the regulation, broken the indefinitely lasting covenant.</em></strong> <strong><em>That is why the curse itself has eaten up the land, and those inhabiting it are held guilty.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Some 800 years before Isaiah’s day, the Israelites willingly entered into a covenant relationship with Jehovah and agreed to abide by it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:3-2:24:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 24:3-8</a>) The terms of that Law covenant stipulated that if they obeyed Jehovah’s commandments, they would experience his rich blessing but if they violated the covenant, they would lose his blessing and be taken captive by their enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 19:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:1-5:28:68" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 28:1-68</a>) This Law covenant, given through Moses, was to remain in force for an indefinite, unspecified time.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>But the people have “broken the indefinitely lasting covenant.” They have bypassed the divinely given laws, ignoring them.

No mercy will be shown in the coming judgment. Among the first to ‘wither’ because of Jehovah’s withdrawing his protection and favor will be “the high ones,” the nobility. In fulfillment of this, as the destruction of Jerusalem approaches, first the Egyptians and then the Babylonians make Judean kings their vassals. Subsequently, King Jehoiachin and other members of the royal family are among the first ones taken into Babylonian captivity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:4-14:36:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:9-14:36:10" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">9, 10. (a) What role does agriculture play in Israel? (b) What is the significance of each one ‘sitting under his own vine and fig tree’?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The nation of Israel is an agricultural society. From the time that the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they have settled down to a life of cultivating crops and herding livestock. Thus, agriculture occupies an important place in the legislation given to Israel. A compulsory sabbath rest is commanded for the land every seventh year to allow fertility to be restored to the soil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:10-2:23:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 23:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:3-3:25:7" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Leviticus 25:3-7</a>) The three annual festivals that the nation is commanded to celebrate are timed to coincide with agricultural seasons.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:14-2:23:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Exodus 23:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Vineyards are common throughout the land. The Scriptures list wine, a product of the vine, as a gift from God that “makes the heart of mortal man rejoice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:15-19:104:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 104:15</a>) Each one ‘sitting under his own vine and fig tree,’ denotes prosperity, peace, and security under God’s righteous rule.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>In order to harvest olives, the Israelites beat the trees with rods so that the fruit will fall. According to God’s Law, <span id="page265" class="pageNum" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>they are forbidden to go over the boughs of the trees to collect the remaining olives. Nor should they gather the leftover grapes after harvesting their vineyards. The remnants of the harvest are to be left for the poor​—“for the alien resident, for the fatherless boy and for the widow”—​to glean. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:19-5:24:21" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>) Drawing on these well-known laws, Isaiah illustrates the comforting fact that there will be survivors of Jehovah’s coming judgment: <strong><em>“Thus it will become in the midst of the land, in among the peoples, like the beating off of the olive tree, like the gleaning when the grape gathering has come to an end.</em></strong> <strong><em>They themselves will raise their voice, they will cry out joyfully. In the superiority of Jehovah they will certainly cry out shrilly from the sea.</em></strong> <strong><em>That is why in the region of light they must glorify Jehovah, in the islands of the sea the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</em></strong> <strong><em>From the extremity of the land there are melodies that we have heard: ‘Decoration to the Righteous One!’”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:13-23:24:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 24:13</em></strong><strong><em>-16a</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Just as some fruit remains on the tree or vine after harvesting, so there will be some who are left over after Jehovah’s execution of judgment​—“the gleaning when the grape gathering has come to an end.” As recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:6-23:24:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa 24 verse 6</a>, the prophet has already spoken of these, saying <span id="page266" class="pageNum" data-no="266" data-before-text="266"></span>that “very few mortal men have remained over.” Still, few as they are, there are to be survivors of the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah, and later a remnant will return from captivity to repopulate the land.

The survivors will see Jehovah’s prophetic word unfold and will realize that Isaiah has been a true prophet of God. They will be filled with joy as they witness the fulfillment of the restoration prophecies. From wherever they have been scattered​—be it the islands of the Mediterranean in the West, Babylon in “the region of light” (the sunrise, or the East), or any other distant place—​they will praise God because they have been preserved, and they will sing: “Decoration to the Righteous One!”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Revelation 16:13, 14</a>) Speaking symbolically, Isaiah says that they will be gathered and “shut up in the dungeon.” “After an abundance of days,” perhaps when <span id="page270" class="pageNum" data-no="270" data-before-text="270"></span>Satan and his demons (but not “the kings of the ground upon the ground”) are temporarily released at the end of the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ, God will bring upon them the final punishment they deserve.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:3-66:20:3" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Revelation 20:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 7-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>This part of Isaiah’s prophecy thus left the Jews with a wonderful assurance. In Jehovah’s due time, he would bring about the fall of ancient Babylon and restore the Jews to their homeland. In 537 B.C.E., when he demonstrates his power and sovereignty in this way in behalf of his people, it could truly be said to them: “Your God has become king!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:7</a>) In modern times, Jehovah ‘became king’ in 1914 when he installed Jesus Christ as King in His heavenly Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:10-19:96:10" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 96:10</a>) He also ‘became king’ in 1919 when he demonstrated the power of his kingship by liberating spiritual Israel from bondage to Babylon the Great.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Jehovah will again “become king” when he brings an end to Babylon the Great and the rest of this wicked system of things.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:5-66:22:5" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 22:5</a>.) They will be ashamed, so to speak, to compare themselves to the glorious Jehovah of armies.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 1. Why does Isaiah have appreciation for Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">ISAIAH has deep love for Jehovah and delights in praising him. He cries out: <strong><em>“O Jehovah, you are my God. I exalt you, I laud your name.” </em></strong>What helps the prophet to have such fine appreciation for his Creator? A major factor is his knowledge of Jehovah and of his activities. Isaiah’s next words reveal this knowledge: <strong><em>“For you have done wonderful things, counsels from early times, in faithfulness, in trustworthiness.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:1-23:25:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Like Joshua before him, Isaiah knows that Jehovah is faithful and trustworthy and that all his “counsels”​—the things he purposes—​come true.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 2. What counsel of Jehovah does Isaiah now pronounce, and what may be the object of this counsel?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The counsels of Jehovah include his judgment declarations against Israel’s enemies. Isaiah now pronounces one of these: <strong><em>“You have made a city a pile of stones, a fortified town a crumbling ruin, a dwelling tower of strangers to be no city, which will not be rebuilt even to time indefinite.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:2-23:25:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:2</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>What is this unnamed city? Isaiah may be referring to Ar of Moab​—Moab has long been at enmity with God’s people.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Or he may be referring to another, stronger city​—Babylon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 15:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:8-36:2:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Zephaniah 2:8, 9</a></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 3. In what way do Jehovah’s enemies glorify him?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>How will Jehovah’s enemies react when his counsel <span id="page272" class="pageNum" data-no="272" data-before-text="272"></span>against their strong city comes true? <strong><em>“Those who are a strong people will glorify you; the town of the tyrannical nations, they will fear you.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:3-23:25:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:3</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>It is understandable that the enemies of the almighty God will fear him. How, though, do they glorify him? Will they abandon their false gods and adopt pure worship? Hardly! Rather, like Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, they glorify Jehovah when they are compelled to recognize his overwhelming superiority.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:16-2:10:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 10:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:30-2:12:33" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12:30-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:37-27:4:37" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Daniel 4:37</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 4. What “town of the tyrannical nations” exists today, and how does even she have to glorify Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Today “the town of the tyrannical nations” is “the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth,” namely, “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:18-66:17:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 18</a>) The principal part of this empire is Christendom. How do the religious leaders of Christendom glorify Jehovah? By bitterly conceding the wonderful things he has accomplished in behalf of his Witnesses. Particularly in 1919 when Jehovah restored his servants to dynamic activity after their release from spiritual captivity to Babylon the Great, these leaders “became frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:13-66:11:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 11:13</a>.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 5. How does Jehovah protect those who have absolute confidence in him?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Although fearsome when viewed by his enemies, Jehovah is a refuge to the meek and humble who want to serve him. Religious and political tyrants may try everything to break the faith of true worshipers, but they fail because these have absolute confidence in Jehovah. Eventually, he easily silences his opposers, doing so as if he were covering the burning desert sun with a cloud or blocking the force of a rainstorm with a wall.​<strong><em>—Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:4-23:25:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:4,</em></strong> <strong><em>5</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">6, 7. (a) What kind of feast does Jehovah spread, and for whom? (b) What does the banquet prophesied by Isaiah foreshadow?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Like a loving father, Jehovah not only protects but also feeds his children, especially in a spiritual way. After liberating his people in 1919, he set before them a victory banquet, an abundant supply of spiritual food: <strong><em>“Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples, in this mountain, a banquet of well-oiled dishes, a banquet of wine kept on the dregs, of well-oiled dishes filled with marrow, of wine kept on the dregs, filtered.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The banquet is spread in Jehovah’s “mountain.” What is this mountain? It is “the mountain of the house of Jehovah” to which all nations stream “in the final part of the days.” It is Jehovah’s “holy mountain,” where his faithful worshipers do no harm and cause no ruin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11:9</a>) In this elevated place of worship, Jehovah spreads his lush banquet for faithful ones. And the spiritual good things now supplied so generously foreshadow the physical good things that will be provided when God’s Kingdom becomes the sole government of mankind. Then hunger will be no more. “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:8-19:72:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 72:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Those who now partake of the divinely provided spiritual feast have glorious prospects. Listen to Isaiah’s next words. Comparing sin and death to a suffocating “woven work,” or “envelopment,” he says: <strong><em>“In this mountain </em>[<em>Jehovah</em>] <em>will certainly swallow up the face of the envelopment that is enveloping over all the peoples, and the woven work that is interwoven upon all the nations.</em></strong> <strong><em>He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord </em></strong><span id="page274" class="pageNum" data-no="274" data-before-text="274"></span><strong><em>Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:7-23:25:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:7,</em></strong> <strong><em>8a</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Yes, no more sin and death! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) Moreover, the lying reproach that Jehovah’s servants have endured for thousands of years will also be done away with. <strong><em>“The reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:8-23:25:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:8b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>How will this happen? Jehovah will remove the source of that reproach, Satan and his seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 20:1-3</a>) Little wonder that God’s people will be moved to exclaim: <strong><em>“Look! This is our God. We have hoped in him, and he will save us. This is Jehovah. We have hoped in him. Let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:9-23:25:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:9</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">10, 11. What harsh treatment does Jehovah reserve for Moab?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Jehovah saves those of his people who manifest humility. However, Israel’s neighbor Moab is proud, and Jehovah detests pride. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:18-20:16:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:18</a>) Moab, therefore, is slated for humiliation. <strong><em>“The hand of Jehovah will settle down on this mountain, and Moab must be trodden down in its place as when a straw heap is trodden down in a manure place. And he must slap out his hands in the midst of it as when a swimmer slaps them out to swim, and he must abase its haughtiness with the tricky movements of his hands. And the fortified city, with your high walls of security, he must lay low; he must abase it, bring it into contact with the earth, to the dust.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:10-23:25:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 25:10-12</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Jehovah’s hand will “settle down” protectively on his holy mountain. However, haughty Moab is to be slapped and trodden down as “in a manure place.” In Isaiah’s time, straw is trampled into piles of dung to make fertilizer; so <span id="page276" class="pageNum" data-no="276" data-before-text="276"></span>Isaiah foretells humiliation for Moab, despite her high, seemingly secure walls.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">12. Why is Moab singled out for Jehovah’s judgment declaration?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Why does Jehovah single out Moab for such harsh counsel? The Moabites are descendants of Lot, the nephew of Abraham and a worshiper of Jehovah. Thus, they are not only neighbors of God’s covenant nation but also relatives. Despite this, they have adopted false gods and manifested hard-set enmity toward Israel. They deserve their fate. In this, Moab is like the enemies of Jehovah’s servants today. She is especially like Christendom, which claims to have roots in the first-century Christian congregation but which, as seen earlier, is the principal part of Babylon the Great.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>A Song of Salvation</strong></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">13, 14. What “strong city” does God’s people have today, and who are allowed to enter it?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>What of God’s people? Thrilled to have Jehovah’s favor and protection, they raise their voices in song. <strong><em>“In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: ‘We have a strong city. He sets salvation itself for walls and rampart. Open the gates, you men, that the righteous nation that is keeping faithful conduct may enter.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:1-23:26:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 26:1, 2</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>While these words no doubt had a fulfillment in ancient times, they also have a clear fulfillment today. Jehovah’s “righteous nation,” spiritual Israel, is endowed with a strong, citylike organization. What a cause for rejoicing, for song!</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>What kind of people come into this “city”? The song gives the answer: <strong><em>“The inclination that is well supported you </em>[<em>God</em>] <em>will safeguard in continuous peace, because it is in you that one is made to trust. Trust in Jehovah, you people, for all times, for in Jah Jehovah is the Rock of times indefinite.” </em></strong><span id="page277" class="pageNum" data-no="277" data-before-text="277"></span><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:3-23:26:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 26:3, 4</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>“The inclination” Jehovah supports is the desire to obey his righteous principles and to trust in him, not in the floundering commercial, political, and religious systems of the world. “Jah Jehovah” is the only reliable Rock of security. Those having full confidence in Jehovah receive his protection and enjoy “continuous peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>What a contrast to what happens to the enemies of God’s people! <strong><em>“He has laid low those inhabiting the height, the elevated town.

Whatever the case, Jehovah has turned the tables on “the elevated town,” and his ‘lowly and afflicted ones’ trample it. Today this prophecy aptly fits Babylon the Great, particularly Christendom. In 1919 this “elevated town” was forced to release Jehovah’s people​—a humiliating fall—​and they, in turn, have taken to trampling upon their old captor.

He compares the nation to a woman who is in labor but who without help is unable to give birth. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:17-23:26:18" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 26:17, 18</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>That help comes in 537 B.C.E., and Jehovah’s people return to their homeland, eager to rebuild the temple and restore true worship. In effect, the nation is raised from the dead. <strong><em>“Your dead ones will live. A corpse of mine​—they will rise up. Awake and cry out joyfully, you residents in the dust!

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>However, if faithful ones are to enjoy the spiritual blessings promised through Isaiah, they must obey Jehovah’s commands: <strong><em>“Go, my people, enter into your interior rooms, and shut your doors behind you.

Jehovah is coming forth from his place to call to account the error of the inhabitant of the land against him, and the land will certainly expose her bloodshed and will no longer cover over her killed ones.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:20-23:26:21" data-bid="48-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 26:20, 21</em></strong></a><strong><em>; </em></strong>compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:14</a>.) This passage may have an initial fulfillment when the Medes and the Persians, led by King Cyrus, conquer Babylon in 539 B.C.E. According to the Greek historian Xenophon, when Cyrus enters Babylon, <span id="page283" class="pageNum" data-no="283" data-before-text="283"></span>he commands everyone to stay in their homes because his cavalry has “orders to cut down all whom they found out of doors.” Today, the “interior rooms” of this prophecy could be closely linked with the tens of thousands of congregations of Jehovah’s people around the world. Such congregations will continue to play a key role in our lives, even through “the great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>) How vital that we maintain a wholesome attitude toward the congregation and regularly associate with it!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Looking toward that time, Isaiah prophesies: <strong><em>“In that day Jehovah, with his hard and great and strong sword, will turn his attention to Leviathan, the gliding serpent, even to Leviathan, the crooked serpent, and he will certainly kill the sea monster that is in the sea.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:1-23:27:1" data-bid="53-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 27:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>In the initial fulfillment, “Leviathan” refers to the countries to which Israel has been scattered, such as Babylon, Egypt, and Assyria. These countries will be unable to prevent the return of Jehovah’s people to their homeland at the proper time. Who, though, is the modern-day Leviathan? It appears to be Satan​—“the original serpent”—​and his wicked system of things here on earth, his tool for warring against spiritual Israel.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>With another song, Isaiah now beautifully illustrates the fruitfulness of Jehovah’s freed people: <strong><em>“In that day </em></strong><span id="page285" class="pageNum" data-no="285" data-before-text="285"></span><strong><em>sing to her, you people: ‘A vineyard of foaming wine!

Hence, let no one endanger the welfare of the Christian congregation! Rather, let all ‘take hold of Jehovah’s stronghold,’ seeking his favor and protection. In so doing, they make peace with God​—something so important that Isaiah mentions it twice. The result? <strong><em>“In the coming days Jacob will take root, Israel will put forth blossoms and actually sprout; and they will simply fill the surface of the productive land with produce.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:6-23:27:6" data-bid="59-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 27:6</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong><span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> What wonderful evidence of Jehovah’s power the fulfillment of this verse is! Since 1919, anointed Christians have filled the earth with “produce,” nourishing spiritual food. As a result, they have come to be joined by millions of loyal other sheep, who together with them “are rendering [God] sacred service day and night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15</a>) In the midst of a corrupt world, these joyfully maintain his elevated standards. And Jehovah continues to bless them with increase. May we never lose sight of the grand privilege of partaking of “produce” and sharing it with others through our own shout of praise!</p>

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sc">  In 607 B.C.E., Judah’s pains increase when Jehovah disciplines his wayward nation with the stroke of exile. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:7-23:27:11" data-bid="62-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 27:7-11</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>The nation’s error is too great to be atoned for by animal sacrifices. So, as one might scatter sheep or goats with <strong><em>“a scare cry” </em></strong>or might <strong><em>“blast” </em></strong>leaves away with a strong wind, Jehovah expels Israel from their homeland. Thereafter, even weak peoples, symbolized by the feminine sex, are able to exploit what remains in the land.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sc">  However, the time comes for Jehovah to deliver his people from captivity. He frees them as a farmer might free olives held prisoner, so to speak, on trees. <strong><em>“It must occur in that day that Jehovah will beat off the fruit, from the flowing stream of the River </em>[<em>Euphrates</em>] <em>to the torrent valley of Egypt, and so you yourselves will be picked up one after the other, O sons of Israel.</em></strong> <strong><em>And it must occur in that day that there will be a blowing on a great horn, and those who are perishing in the land of Assyria and those who are dispersed in the land of Egypt will certainly come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:12-23:27:13" data-bid="63-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 27:12,</em></strong> <strong><em>13</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Following his victory in 539 B.C.E., Cyrus issues a decree freeing all the Jews in his empire, which includes those in Assyria and Egypt.

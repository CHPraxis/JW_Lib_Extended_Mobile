<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">1, 2. Why is the prophetic message of Isaiah to the Jews of his day of interest to us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">DISGUSTED with the condition of Jerusalem and Judah, the prophet Isaiah now turns to Jehovah God and declares: <strong><em>“You have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:6-23:2:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 2:6a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>What has provoked God to reject the people whom he himself had chosen as his “special property”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:2-5:14:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Isaiah’s denunciation of the Jews of his time is of great interest to us. Why? Because the condition of Christendom today is very similar to that of Isaiah’s people, and so is the judgment that Jehovah pronounces. Paying attention to Isaiah’s proclamation will give us a clear understanding of what God condemns and will help us to shun practices that he disapproves of. With keen anticipation, then, let us consider Jehovah’s prophetic word as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:6-23:4:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:6–4:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>In Pride They Bow Down</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. What error of his people does Isaiah confess?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Confessing the error of his people, Isaiah says: <strong><em>“They have become full of what is from the East, and they are practicers of magic like the Philistines, and with the children of foreigners they abound.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:6-23:2:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 2:6b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Some 800 years earlier, Jehovah had commanded his chosen people: “Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things <span id="page50" class="pageNum" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>[by which] the nations whom I am sending out from before you have made themselves unclean.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:24-3:18:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:24</a>) Concerning those whom he had selected as his special property, Jehovah forced Balaam to say: “From the top of the rocks I see them, and from the hills I behold them. There as a people they keep tabernacling isolated, and among the nations they do not reckon themselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:9-4:23:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Numbers 23:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:12-4:23:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Yet, by Isaiah’s day Jehovah’s chosen ones have adopted the abominable practices of the surrounding nations and are “full of what is from the East.” Rather than putting faith in Jehovah and his word, they are practicing “magic like the Philistines.” Far from keeping separate from the nations, the land ‘abounds’ with “the children of foreigners”​—doubtless, foreigners who introduce ungodly practices to God’s people.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. Rather than causing them to thank Jehovah, how do riches and military strength affect the Jews?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Noting the current economic prosperity and the military strength of Judah under King Uzziah, Isaiah states: <strong><em>“Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no limit to their treasures.

Instead, they put their trust in the wealth itself and turn away from its Source, Jehovah God. The result? <strong><em>“Their land is filled with valueless gods.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Bowing down can be a sign of humility. But bowing down to lifeless things is futile, making the idol worshiper “low,” degenerate.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The foretold day of judgment comes upon the Jews in 607 B.C.E. when Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar destroys Jerusalem. The inhabitants see their beloved city aflame, its proud buildings demolished, its mighty wall smashed. The temple of Jehovah is reduced to rubble. Neither their treasures nor their chariots amount to anything on “the day belonging to Jehovah of armies.” And their idols? It happens just as Isaiah foretells: <strong><em>“The valueless gods themselves will pass away completely.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:18-23:2:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 2:18</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The Jews​—princes and mighty men included—​are taken into exile to Babylon.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>How similar the condition of Christendom is to that of Jerusalem and Judah in Isaiah’s day! Christendom has certainly cultivated a close relationship with the nations of this world. She is an enthusiastic supporter of the United Nations and has filled her house with idols and unscriptural practices. Her adherents are materialistic and put their confidence in military might. And do they not view their clergy as worthy of great distinction, attributing to them titles and honors? Christendom’s self-exaltation will without fail be brought to nothing. But when?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>The Impending “Day of Jehovah”</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. To what “day of Jehovah” do the apostles Paul and Peter point?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Scriptures point to a “day of Jehovah” that will be of far greater significance than the day of judgment upon ancient Jerusalem and Judah. The apostle Paul, under inspiration, associated the coming “day of Jehovah” with the <span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>presence of the enthroned King Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:1, 2</a>) Peter spoke of that day in connection with the establishment of ‘new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness is to dwell.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>) It is the day on which Jehovah will execute his judgment upon the entire wicked system of things, including Christendom.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. (a) Who will “hold up under” the upcoming “day of Jehovah”? (b) How can we make Jehovah our refuge?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>“Alas for the day,” says the prophet Joel, “because the day of Jehovah is near, and like a despoiling from the Almighty One it will come!” In view of the imminence of that “day,” should not security during that fear-inspiring time concern everyone? “Who can hold up under it?” asks Joel. He answers: “Jehovah will be a refuge for his people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:15-29:1:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Joel 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:11-29:2:11" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:16-29:3:16" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 3:16</a>) Will Jehovah God be a refuge for those who have a haughty spirit and who put their confidence in riches, military might, and man-made gods? Impossible! God abandoned even his chosen people when they acted in this way. How vital that all of God’s servants “seek righteousness, seek meekness,” and examine seriously the place of Jehovah’s worship in their lives!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:2-36:2:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>How will idol worshipers view their idols during Jehovah’s great day? Isaiah answers: <strong><em>“People will enter into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the dust because of the dreadfulness of Jehovah and from his splendid superiority, when he rises up for the earth to suffer shocks.</em></strong> <strong><em>In that day the earthling man will throw his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold . . . to the shrewmice and to the bats,</em></strong> <strong><em>in order to enter into the holes in the rocks and </em></strong><span id="page54" class="pageNum" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span><strong><em>into the clefts of the crags, because of the dreadfulness of Jehovah and from his splendid superiority, when he rises up for the earth to suffer shocks.</em></strong> <strong><em>For your own sakes, hold off from the earthling man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for on what basis is he himself to be taken into account?”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:19-23:2:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 2:19-22</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Shrewmice live in holes in the ground, and bats roost in dark and desolate caves. Moreover, where a large number of bats roost in one place, there is a repulsive smell and a buildup of thick layers of droppings. Casting idols into such places is fitting. A place of darkness and uncleanness is all that they deserve. As for the people, they will seek refuge in caves and clefts in the rock on the day of Jehovah’s judgment. So the fate of the idols and their worshipers will be the same. True to Isaiah’s prophecy, lifeless idols saved neither their worshipers nor Jerusalem from Nebuchadnezzar’s hands in 607 B.C.E.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>During the coming day of Jehovah’s judgment upon Christendom and other segments of the world empire of false religion, what will people do? Faced with deteriorating conditions earth wide, most will likely come to realize that their idols are valueless.

The city will be leveled to the ground. For “her entrances,” it will be a time to “mourn and express sorrow.” Jerusalem will be “cleaned out” and laid desolate.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>The loss of men by the sword will have drastic consequences for the women of Jerusalem. Concluding this part of his prophetic book, Isaiah foretells: <strong><em>“Seven women will actually grab hold of one man in that day, saying: ‘We shall eat our own bread and wear our own mantles; only may we be called by your name to take away our reproach.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:4:1-23:4:1" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 4:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The shortage of marriageable men will become so severe that several women will attach themselves to one man in order to be called by his name​—that is, to be publicly known as his wives—​and thus be free of the reproach of being without a husband. The Mosaic Law required that a husband provide sustenance and clothing for his wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:10-2:21:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Exodus 21:10</a>) However, agreeing to ‘eat their own bread and wear their own clothing,’ these women are willing to release the man from his legal obligations. What a desperate situation for the once haughty “daughters of Zion”!</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Jehovah humiliates self-exalted ones. In 607 B.C.E., he does indeed make the haughtiness of his chosen people “bow down” and cause their “loftiness” to become “low.” May true Christians never forget that “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="38-1" class="b">James 4:6</a>.</p>

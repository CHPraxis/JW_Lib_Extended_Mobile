<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">1, 2. What can be said about the text of the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">TOWARD the end of the 1940’s, a remarkable collection of scrolls was found in caves located near the Dead Sea, in Palestine. They became known as the Dead Sea Scrolls and are believed to have been written sometime between 200 B.C.E. and 70 C.E. Best known among them is a scroll of Isaiah written in Hebrew on durable leather. This scroll is almost complete, and its text differs very little from that of manuscripts of the Masoretic text dated about 1,000 years later. Thus, the scroll demonstrates the accurate transmission of the Bible text.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>A noteworthy detail about the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah is that the portion making up what is today known as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 32</a> is marked with an “X” scrawled in the margin by a scribe. We do not know why the scribe made such a mark, but we do know that there is something special about this portion of the Holy Bible.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>After seeing in vision the final sealing of these 144,000 corulers, the apostle John reports: “I saw, and, <em>look! </em>a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.” Here is the nucleus of the new earth​—a great crowd now numbering into the millions, who have been gathered to the side of the few, mostly elderly remaining ones of the 144,000. This great crowd will survive the fast-approaching great tribulation and in the Paradise earth will be joined by resurrected faithful ones and billions of others who will be given the opportunity to exercise faith.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>However, as long as the present hate-filled world exists, members of the great crowd need protection. In large <span id="page332" class="pageNum" data-no="332" data-before-text="332"></span>measure this is provided by the “princes” who “rule . . . for justice itself.” What a grand arrangement! These “princes” are described further in the glowing words of Isaiah’s prophecy: <strong><em>“Each one must prove to be like a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a waterless country, like the shadow of a heavy crag in an exhausted land.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:2-23:32:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:2</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Right now in this time of worldwide distress, there is a need for “princes,” yes, elders who will “pay attention to . . . all the flock,” caring for Jehovah’s sheep and administering justice in harmony with Jehovah’s righteous principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 20:28</a>) Such “princes” must meet the qualifications set out in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:2-7 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:6-56:1:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Titus 1:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In his great prophecy describing the distressful “conclusion of the system of things,” Jesus said: “See that you are not terrified.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-8</a>) Why are Jesus’ followers not terrified by today’s dangerous world conditions? One reason is that the “princes”​—whether they be anointed or “other sheep”—​are loyally protecting the flock. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) They fearlessly care for their brothers and sisters, even in the face of such horrors as ethnic wars and genocide. In a spiritually exhausted world, they see to it that depressed souls are refreshed by the upbuilding truths of God’s Word, the Bible.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8. How is Jehovah training and using the “princes” who are of the other sheep?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>During the past 50 years, the “princes” have come clearly into view. “Princes” who are of the other sheep are being trained as a developing “chieftain” class so that after the great tribulation, qualified ones from among them will <span id="page334" class="pageNum" data-no="334" data-before-text="334"></span>be ready for appointment to serve in an administrative capacity in the “new earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:44:2-26:44:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezekiel 44:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>) By providing spiritual guidance and refreshment as they take the lead in Kingdom service, they are proving themselves to be “like the shadow of a heavy crag,” bringing relief to the flock in its realm of worship.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9. What conditions show the need for “princes” today?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In these perilous last days of Satan’s wicked world, dedicated Christians sorely need such protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Strong winds of false doctrine and twisted propaganda are blowing. Storms are raging in the form of wars between and within nations as well as direct assaults against faithful worshipers of Jehovah God. In a world parched by spiritual drought, Christians badly need the streams of water of pure, unadulterated truth in order to quench their spiritual thirst. Happily, Jehovah has promised that his reigning King, through his anointed brothers and supportive “princes” of the other sheep, will provide encouragement and guidance to despondent and discouraged ones in this time of need. Jehovah will thus see to it that what is righteous and just will prevail.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Paying Attention With Eyes, Ears, and Hearts</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10. What provisions has Jehovah made so that his people can ‘see’ and ‘hear’ spiritual things?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>How have the great crowd responded to Jehovah’s theocratic arrangement? The prophecy continues: <strong><em>“The eyes of those seeing will not be pasted together, and the very ears of those hearing will pay attention.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:3-23:32:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:3</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Over the years, Jehovah has provided for the instruction and bringing to maturity of his precious servants. The Theocratic Ministry School and other meetings operating <span id="page335" class="pageNum" data-no="335" data-before-text="335"></span>in the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide; the district, national, and international conventions; as well as the specialized training of the “princes” to treat the flock with loving care have all contributed to the building up of a united, global brotherhood of millions. Wherever these shepherds are on earth, their ears are wide open to adjustments in understanding of the advancing word of truth. With Bible-trained consciences, they are ever ready to hear and to obey.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:10-19:25:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 25:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11. Why are God’s people now speaking with confidence, not stammering with uncertainty?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The prophecy then cautions: <strong><em>“The heart itself of those who are overhasty will consider knowledge, and even the tongue of the stammerers will be quick in speaking clear things.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:4-23:32:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:4</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Let no one be overhasty in drawing conclusions about what is right and what is wrong. The Bible says: “Have you beheld a man hasty with his words? There is more hope for someone stupid than for him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:20-20:29:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:2-21:5:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>) Before 1919, even Jehovah’s people were tainted with Babylonish ideas. But starting in that year, Jehovah has given them a clearer understanding of his purposes. They have found the truths he has revealed to be, not overhasty, but well thought out, and they are now speaking with the certainty of belief, not stammering with uncertainty.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Isaiah’s prophecy next draws a contrast: <strong><em>“The senseless one will no longer be called generous; and as for the unprincipled man, he will not be said to be noble;</em></strong> <strong><em>because the senseless one himself will speak mere senselessness.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:5-23:32:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:5,</em></strong> <strong><em>6a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Who is “the senseless one”?

In effect, so do “intellectuals” and others who act as if there were no God, believing that they are accountable to no one. The truth is not in such ones. There is no generosity in their hearts. They have no gospel of love. In contrast with genuine Christians, they are slow to provide for needy ones in distress or fail to do so entirely.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13, 14. (a) How do modern-day apostates work what is hurtful? (b) Of what do apostates try to deprive the hungry and the thirsty, but what will be the final outcome?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Many such senseless ones come to hate those who champion God’s truth. <strong><em>“His very heart will work at what is hurtful, to work at apostasy and to speak against Jehovah what is wayward.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:6-23:32:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:6b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>How true this is of modern-day apostates! In a number of countries in Europe and Asia, apostates have joined forces with other opponents of truth, speaking outright lies to the authorities, with a view to having Jehovah’s Witnesses banned or restricted. They manifest the spirit of the “evil slave,” of whom Jesus prophesied: “If ever that evil slave should say in his heart, ‘My master is delaying,’ and should start to beat his fellow slaves and should eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards, the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know, and will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his part with the hypocrites.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>In the meantime, the apostate causes <strong><em>“the soul of the hungry one to go empty, and he causes even the thirsty one to go without drink itself.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:6-23:32:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:6c</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Enemies of truth <span id="page337" class="pageNum" data-no="337" data-before-text="337"></span>try to deprive truth-hungry people of spiritual food, and they try to keep thirsty ones from drinking the refreshing waters of the Kingdom message. But the final outcome will be what Jehovah declares to his people through another of his prophets: “They will be certain to fight against you, but they will not prevail against you, for ‘I am with you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to deliver you.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:19-24:1:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jeremiah 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Isaiah 54:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>From the middle years of the 20th century, immorality has openly run riot in the lands of Christendom. Why? The prophecy foretold one reason: <strong><em>“As for the unprincipled man, his instruments are bad; he himself has given counsel for acts of loose conduct, to wreck the afflicted ones with false sayings, even when someone poor speaks what is right.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:7-23:32:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:7</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>In fulfillment of these words, many of the clergy in particular have adopted a permissive attitude toward premarital sex, cohabitation of the unmarried, homosexuality​—indeed, “fornication and uncleanness of every sort.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3</a>) Thus, they “wreck” their flocks with their false sayings.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:44-40:5:45" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 5:44, 45</a>) Their greatest happiness is found in doing God’s will, in generously giving of themselves in order to make known to others “the glorious good news of the happy God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11</a>.</p>

In contrast with the majority of mankind, who are divided by hatred, violence, and abject spiritual poverty, true Christians are globally united, even though they are “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” They live, work, and serve in harmony with God’s righteousness, doing so in confidence of enjoying, at last, true peace and security to time indefinite.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:17-66:7:17" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

It says: <strong><em>“My people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting-places.”</em></strong> But for the imitation Christians, <strong><em>“it will certainly hail when the forest goes down and the city becomes low in an abased state.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:19-23:32:19" data-bid="43-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:19</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Yes, like a tempestuous hailstorm, Jehovah’s judgment is poised to strike the counterfeit city of false religion, debasing its “forest” of supporters, obliterating these for all time!</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>This portion of the prophecy concludes: <strong><em>“Happy are you people who are sowing seed alongside all waters, sending forth the feet of the bull and of the ass.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:20-23:32:20" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 32:20</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The bull and the ass were beasts of burden used by God’s ancient people in plowing fields and sowing seed. Today, Jehovah’s people use printing equipment, electronic tools, modern buildings and transport and, above all, a united, theocratic organization to print and distribute billions of Bible publications. Willing workers use these instruments to sow seeds of Kingdom truth throughout the earth, literally “alongside all waters.” Millions of God-fearing men and women have already been harvested, and other multitudes are joining them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:15-66:14:16" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 14:15, 16</a>) All of them are indeed to be counted “happy”!</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 1. What terrible error did Jeroboam make?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">WHEN Jehovah’s covenant people were divided into two kingdoms, the northern ten-tribe kingdom came under the rulership of Jeroboam. The new king was an able, energetic ruler. But he lacked real faith in Jehovah. Because of this he made a terrible error that blighted the whole history of the northern kingdom. Under the Mosaic Law, the Israelites were commanded to travel three times a year up to the temple in Jerusalem, which was now in the southern kingdom of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:16-5:16:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>) Afraid that such regular journeys would make his subjects think about reunification with their southern brothers, Jeroboam “made two golden calves and said to the people: ‘It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’ Then he placed the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:28-11:12:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Kings 12:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">2, 3. What effects did Jeroboam’s error have on Israel?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In the short term, Jeroboam’s plan seemed to work. The people gradually left off going to Jerusalem and took up worshiping before the two calves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:30-11:12:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 12:30</a>) However, this apostate religious practice corrupted the ten-tribe kingdom. In later years, even Jehu, who had shown such commendable zeal in clearing Baal worship out of Israel, continued to bow down to the golden calves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:28-12:10:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Kings 10:28, 29</a>) What else resulted from Jeroboam’s tragically <span id="page134" class="pageNum" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>wrong decision? Political instability and suffering for the people.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Because Jeroboam had become apostate, Jehovah said that his seed would not reign over the land, and in the end the northern kingdom would suffer a terrible disaster. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:14-11:14:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 14:14, 15</a>) Jehovah’s word proved true. Seven of Israel’s kings ruled for two years or less​—some for only a few days. One king committed suicide, and six were assassinated by ambitious men who usurped the throne. Especially after the reign of Jeroboam II, which ended about 804 B.C.E. while Uzziah was reigning in Judah, Israel was plagued with unrest, violence, and assassinations. It is against this backdrop that Jehovah through Isaiah sends a direct warning, or “word,” to the northern kingdom. <strong><em>“There was a word that Jehovah sent against Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:8-23:9:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:8</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jehovah’s “word” will not be ignored. <strong><em>“The people will certainly know it, even all of them, Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, because of their haughtiness and because of their insolence of heart.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:9-23:9:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:9</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>“Jacob,” “Israel,” “Ephraim,” and “Samaria” all refer to the northern kingdom of Israel, of which Ephraim is the predominant tribe and Samaria the capital. Jehovah’s word against that kingdom is a strong judicial statement, for Ephraim has <span id="page135" class="pageNum" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>become hardened in apostasy and is brazenly insolent toward Jehovah. God will not protect the people from the consequences of their wicked ways.

In effect, the people say: ‘We may lose houses made of perishable mud bricks and inexpensive wood, but we will do more than make good for these losses by rebuilding with superior materials​—hewn stone and cedar!’ (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:19-18:4:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 4:19</a>.)

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Isaiah continues: <strong><em>“Jehovah will set the adversaries of Rezin on high against him.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:11-23:9:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:11a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>King Pekah of Israel and King Rezin of Syria are allies. They are scheming to conquer the two-tribe kingdom of Judah and to place on Jehovah’s throne in Jerusalem a puppet king​—a certain “son of Tabeel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:6-23:7:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:6</a>) But the conspiracy is doomed. <span id="page136" class="pageNum" data-no="136" data-before-text="136"></span>Rezin has powerful enemies, and Jehovah will ‘set on high’ these enemies against “him,” Israel. The term ‘set on high’ means to allow them to wage effective warfare that will bring about the destruction of the alliance and its objectives.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">7, 8. For Israel, what is the result of Assyria’s conquest of Syria?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The dissolving of this alliance begins when Assyria attacks Syria. “The king of Assyria went up to Damascus [the capital of Syria] and captured it and led its people into exile at Kir, and Rezin he put to death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:9-12:16:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Kings 16:9</a>) Having lost his powerful ally, Pekah finds that his designs on Judah are thwarted. In fact, shortly after Rezin’s death, Pekah himself is assassinated by Hoshea, who thereafter usurps the throne of Samaria.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:23-12:15:25" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Kings 15:23-25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:30-12:15:30" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Syria, Israel’s former ally, is now a vassal of Assyria, the dominant power in the region. Isaiah prophesies about how Jehovah will use this new political alignment: <strong><em>“The enemies of that one </em>[<em>Israel</em>] <em>he </em>[<em>Jehovah</em>] <em>will goad on,</em></strong> <strong><em>Syria from the east and the Philistines from behind, and they will eat up Israel with open mouth. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:11-23:9:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:11b, 12</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Yes, Syria is now Israel’s enemy, and Israel must prepare for attack from Assyria <em>and </em>Syria. The invasion succeeds. Assyria makes the usurper Hoshea his servant, exacting a hefty tribute. (A few decades earlier, Assyria received a large sum from King Menahem of Israel.) How true the prophet Hosea’s words: “Strangers have eaten up his [Ephraim’s] power”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:7:9-28:7:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hosea 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:19-12:15:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 15:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:3" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 17:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. Why can we say that the Philistines attack “from behind”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Does not Isaiah also say that the Philistines will invade “from behind”? Yes. Prior to the days of magnetic compasses, <span id="page137" class="pageNum" data-no="137" data-before-text="137"></span>the Hebrews indicated direction from the viewpoint of a person facing the sunrising. Thus, “the east” was the front, while the west, the coastal home of the Philistines, was “behind.” The “Israel” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:12-23:9:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:12</a> may include Judah in this instance because the Philistines invaded Judah during the reign of Pekah’s contemporary, Ahaz, capturing and occupying a number of Judean cities and strongholds. Like Ephraim to the north, Judah deserves this discipline from Jehovah, for she too is riddled with apostasy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:1-14:28:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 28:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:18-14:28:19" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11. What punishment will Jehovah bring against Israel because of their persistent rebellion?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In spite of all its suffering​—and despite the strong pronouncements of Jehovah’s prophets—​the northern kingdom persists in rebellion against Jehovah. <strong><em>“The people themselves have not returned to the One striking them, and Jehovah of armies they have not sought.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:13-23:9:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:13</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> Consequently, the prophet says: <strong><em>“Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, shoot and rush, in one day. The aged and highly respected one is the head, and the prophet giving false instruction is the tail.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The “head” and the “shoot” represent “the aged and highly respected one”​—the leaders of the nation. The “tail” and the “rush” refer to false prophets who utter words pleasing to their leaders. A Bible scholar writes: “The false Prophets are called the tail, because they were morally the basest of the people, and because they <span id="page138" class="pageNum" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>were the servile adherents and supporters of wicked rulers.” Professor Edward J. Young says of these false prophets: “No leaders were they but, following where the leaders led, they simply flattered and fawned, a wagging tail on a dog.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:3-55:4:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:3</a>.</p>

Jehovah patiently sends his prophets, hoping that the people will change their ways. For example, “Do come back, O Israel, to Jehovah your God, for you have stumbled in your error,” pleads Hosea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:1-28:14:1" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hosea 14:1</a>) How it must pain the Champion of widows and fatherless boys to have to execute judgment against even them!</p>

Bible commentators Keil and Delitzsch describe the level of violence as being “the most inhuman self-destruction during an anarchical civil war. Destitute of any tender emotions, they devoured one another without being satisfied.” Likely, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh are singled out here because they are the main representatives of the northern kingdom and, as descendants of Joseph’s two sons, they are the most closely related of the ten tribes. Despite this, however, they interrupt their fratricidal violence only when they war against Judah to the south.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:1-14:28:8" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 28:1-8</a>.</p>

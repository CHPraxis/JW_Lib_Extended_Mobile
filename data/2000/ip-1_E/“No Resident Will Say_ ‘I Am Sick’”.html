At the peak of its power, that aggressive nation seems unbeatable. It has ‘despoiled without being despoiled,’ ravaging the cities of Judah, even stripping the house of Jehovah of its wealth​—and doing so with seeming impunity!

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>During that frightening period of time, loyal worshipers of Jehovah will need to turn to him for help.

With an attitude like that of Sennacherib, Satan the Devil will be emboldened to strike out​—not only against apostate organizations deserving of punishment but also against true Christians. Alongside the remaining ones of Jehovah’s anointed spiritual sons, millions who have come out of Satan’s world, which includes Babylon the Great, take their stand for Jehovah’s Kingdom. Angered at the refusal of true Christians to pay him homage, “the god of this system of things,” Satan, will launch an all-out attack against them.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:14-12:18:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) The Assyrian will <strong><em>‘contemn the cities’ </em></strong>of Judah, viewing them with contempt and scorn, having no regard for human life.

As in Hezekiah’s day, physical resistance to these destructive forces will be futile. Christendom’s “heroes”​—its politicians, financiers, and other people of influence—​will be unable to come to her aid. Political and financial ‘covenants,’ or agreements, designed to protect Christendom’s interests will be violated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:15-23:28:18" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:15-18</a>) Frantic attempts to stave off destruction by diplomacy will fail. Commercial activities will come to a halt, as Christendom’s properties and investments are confiscated or destroyed. Any who still have friendly feelings toward Christendom will do little more than stand at a safe distance and mourn her passing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:9-66:18:19" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 18:9-19</a>) Will true Christianity be swept away with the false?

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">18. What responsibility does Jehovah accept?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Why, though, can lovers of God’s Kingdom feel so confident of divine protection? Explains Isaiah: <strong><em>“Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King; he himself will save us.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="49-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 33:22</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Jehovah accepts the responsibility of protecting and directing his people, who recognize his position as Supreme Sovereign. These willingly submit to his rule through his Messianic King, recognizing that Jehovah has the authority not only to make laws but also to enforce them. However, because Jehovah is a lover of righteousness and justice, his rule, through his Son, is not a burden to his worshipers. Rather, they ‘benefit themselves’ by submitting to his authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>) He will never abandon his loyal ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 37:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. How does Isaiah describe the ineffectiveness of enemies of Jehovah’s faithful people?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Isaiah tells enemies of Jehovah’s faithful people: <strong><em>“Your ropes must hang loose; their mast they will not hold firmly erect; they have not spread a sail. At that time even spoil </em></strong><span id="page352" class="pageNum" data-no="352" data-before-text="352"></span><strong><em>in abundance will have to be divided up; the lame ones themselves will actually take a big plunder.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:23-23:33:23" data-bid="52-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 33:23</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Any approaching enemy will prove to be as ineffective and helpless against Jehovah as a warship with loose rigging, a wobbling mast, and no sail. The destruction of God’s enemies will result in so much spoil that even disabled ones will share in taking plunder. We can therefore be confident that through the King Jesus Christ, Jehovah will triumph over his enemies in the coming “great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>A Healing</strong></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. God’s people will experience what kind of healing, and when?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>This section of Isaiah’s prophecy concludes with a heartwarming promise: <strong><em>“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’ The people that are dwelling in the land will be those pardoned for their error.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="54-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 33:24</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The sickness that Isaiah speaks of is primarily spiritual, for it is connected with sin, or “error.” In the first application of these words, Jehovah promises that after their release from Babylonian captivity, the nation will be healed spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:6-24:33:6" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 33:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:1-19:103:5" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 103:1-5</a>.) Having been forgiven for their former sins, the returning Jews will reestablish pure worship in Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21. In what ways do Jehovah’s worshipers today experience spiritual healing?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>However, Isaiah’s prophecy has a modern fulfillment. Jehovah’s people today have also enjoyed a spiritual healing. They have been liberated from such false teachings as the immortality of the soul, the Trinity, and hellfire. They receive moral guidance, freeing them from immoral <span id="page355" class="pageNum" data-no="355" data-before-text="355"></span>practices and helping them to make good decisions. And thanks to the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, they have a clean standing before God and enjoy a clean conscience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:13-51:1:14" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Colossians 1:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:24-60:2:24" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="57-3" class="b"> 1 John 4:10</a>) This spiritual healing has physical benefits. For example, avoiding immoral sex and the use of tobacco products protects Christians against sexually transmitted diseases and certain forms of cancer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="58-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22, 23. (a) What grand fulfillment will <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a> have in the future? (b) What is the resolve of true worshipers today?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Moreover, there will be a grander fulfillment of the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a> after Armageddon, in God’s new world. Under the rulership of the Messianic Kingdom, humans will experience a great <em>physical </em>healing along with their spiritual healing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) Shortly after the destruction of Satan’s system of things, miracles like those that Jesus performed while on earth will no doubt take place on a global scale. The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the lame will walk! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>) This will allow all survivors of the great tribulation to share in the grand work of bringing the earth to a paradisaic condition.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Later, when the resurrection begins, those coming back to life will no doubt be raised with good health. But as the value of the ransom sacrifice is applied to an increasing extent, more physical benefits will ensue, until mankind is lifted to perfection. Then, righteous ones will “come to life” in the fullest sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:5-66:20:6" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Revelation 20:5, 6</a>) At that time, in both a spiritual and a physical way, “No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” What an exciting promise! May all true worshipers today resolve to be among those who will experience its fulfillment!</p>

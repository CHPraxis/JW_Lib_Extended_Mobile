Neither his parents, nor the angels, nor even the Creator had seen a human baby before. This newborn infant could have brought hope to a condemned human race. How disappointing it was when, after he grew up, he became a murderer! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:12-62:3:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 3:12</a>) Since then mankind has witnessed countless other murders.

He was born of a virgin, by the power of holy spirit​—the only such birth in history. At the time of his birth, a multitude of joyful angels sang praises to God, saying: “Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:13-42:2:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 2:13, 14</a>) Far from being a murderer, Jesus opened the way for humans to be at peace with God and to gain everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:55-46:15:55" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:55</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Turning to the Demons</strong></p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">4, 5. What is the state of affairs in Isaiah’s day, and to whom do some turn?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Because of their disobedience, Isaiah’s contemporaries are in a deplorable moral state, a veritable pit of spiritual darkness. Even the southern kingdom of Judah, the location of God’s temple, has no peace. As a result of their unfaithfulness, the people of Judah are threatened with invasion by the Assyrians, and hard times lie ahead. To whom do they turn for help? Sadly, many turn to Satan, not to Jehovah. No, they do not invoke Satan by name. Rather, like King Saul of old, they engage in spiritism, looking for answers to their problems by trying to communicate with the dead.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:1-9:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Samuel 28:1-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Some are even promoting this practice. Isaiah points to such apostasy when he says: <strong><em>“In case they should say to you people: ‘Apply to the spiritistic mediums or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping and making utterances in low tones,’ is it not to its God that any people should apply? Should there be application to dead persons in behalf of living persons?” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:19-23:8:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 8:19</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Spirit mediums can trick people, “chirping and making utterances <span id="page120" class="pageNum" data-no="120" data-before-text="120"></span>in low tones.” Such sound effects, attributed to the spirits of dead ones, can be worked through ventriloquism by a living medium. At times, though, the demons may get directly involved and impersonate the dead, as apparently happened when Saul inquired of the witch of Endor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:8-9:28:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Samuel 28:8-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 6. Why are the Israelites who have resorted to spiritism especially blameworthy?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>All of this is going on in Judah despite the fact that Jehovah has forbidden the practice of spiritism. Under the Mosaic Law, it is a capital offense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:31-3:19:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:6-3:20:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 20:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:27-3:20:27" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:9-5:18:12" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>) Why do a people who are Jehovah’s special possession commit such a grave transgression?

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> 7. How do many today imitate the Israelites of Isaiah’s day, and what will be the future of such ones if they do not repent?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Likely they reason, ‘Of what good is the Law of Jehovah when we are faced with an imminent attack by the Assyrians?’ They want a quick and easy solution to their predicament and are not about to wait for Jehovah to work out his will. In our day too, many ignore Jehovah’s law and search out spirit mediums, consult horoscopes, and resort to other forms of occultism to solve their problems. However, for the living to seek answers from the dead is just as ridiculous today as it was back then. The future of any who unrepentantly practice such things will be with the “murderers and fornicators and . . . idolaters and all the liars.” They have no future prospects of life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 21:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 8. What is “the law” and “the attestation” to which we today should be going for direction?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah’s law banning spiritism, together with his other commands, is not hidden in Judah. It is preserved in writing. Today his Word is available in its completed form in writing. It is the Bible, which includes not only a compilation of divine laws and regulations but also an account of God’s dealings with his people. This Bible account of Jehovah’s dealings forms an attestation, or testimony, teaching us about Jehovah’s nature and qualities. Instead of consulting with the dead, where should the Israelites be going for direction? Isaiah answers: <strong><em>“To the law and to the attestation!” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:20-23:8:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 8:20a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Yes, those seeking true enlightenment should go to God’s written Word.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Some Israelites dabbling in spiritism may profess respect for the written Word of God. But such claims are empty and hypocritical. Isaiah says: <strong><em>“Surely they will keep saying what is according to this statement that will have no light of dawn.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:20-23:8:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 8:20b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>To what statement is Isaiah here referring? Perhaps to the statement: “To the law and to the attestation!” It may be that some apostate Israelites refer to the Word of God, just as apostates and others today may quote Scripture. But <span id="page122" class="pageNum" data-no="122" data-before-text="122"></span>these are mere words.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:14-46:2:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>) Isaiah describes their condition: <strong><em>“Each one will certainly pass through the land hard pressed and hungry.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:21-23:8:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 8:21a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Because of the nation’s unfaithfulness​—particularly during the reign of King Ahaz—​the survival of Judah as an independent kingdom is threatened. The nation is surrounded by enemies. The Assyrian army assaults one Judean city after another. The enemy desolates the productive land, making food scarce. Many are “hard pressed and hungry.” But another kind of hunger also afflicts the land. Some decades earlier Amos prophesied: “‘Look! There are days coming,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and I will send a famine into the land, a famine, not for bread, and a thirst, not for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:11-30:8:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Amos 8:11</a>) Judah is now in the throes of just such a spiritual famine!</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Isaiah now alludes to one of the worst of the cataclysmic events that come upon the descendants of Abraham: <strong><em>“The obscureness will not be as when the land had stress, as at the former time when one treated with contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali and when at the later time one caused it to be honored​—the way by the sea, in the region of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:1-23:9:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Galilee is a territory in the northern kingdom of Israel. In Isaiah’s prophecy it includes “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali” and also “the way by the sea,” an ancient road that ran by the Sea of Galilee and led to the Mediterranean Sea. In Isaiah’s day, the region is called “Galilee of the nations,” likely because many of its cities are inhabited by non-Israelites.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> <span id="page125" class="pageNum" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>How is this land “treated with contempt”?

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>The apostle Matthew answers this question in his inspired record of the earthly ministry of Jesus. Describing the early days of that ministry, Matthew says: “After leaving Nazareth, [Jesus] came and took up residence in Capernaum beside the sea in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: ‘O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:13-40:4:16" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matthew 4:13-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>The effects of the activity of the Messiah are permanent, as we see from Isaiah’s next words: <strong><em>“The yoke of their load and the rod upon their shoulders, the staff of the one driving them to work, you have shattered to pieces as in the day of Midian.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:4-23:9:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:4</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Centuries before Isaiah’s day, the Midianites conspired with the Moabites to <span id="page129" class="pageNum" data-no="129" data-before-text="129"></span>lure Israel into sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:1-4:25:9" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Numbers 25:1-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:14-4:25:18" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 14-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:15-4:31:16" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 31:15, 16</a>) Later, Midianites terrorized the Israelites by raiding and plundering their villages and farms for seven years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:1-7:6:6" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Judges 6:1-6</a>) But then Jehovah, through his servant Gideon, routed Midian’s armies. After that “day of Midian,” there is no evidence that Jehovah’s people ever again suffered at the hands of the Midianites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:7-7:6:16" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Judges 6:7-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:28-7:8:28" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 8:28</a>) In the near future, Jesus Christ, the greater Gideon, will deliver a deathblow to modern-day enemies of Jehovah’s people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:2-7:7:22" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Judges 7:2-22</a>) God’s people will never again suffer under the yoke of oppression!</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">21. What does Isaiah’s prophecy indicate as to the future of warfare?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Displays of divine power are not a glorification of warfare. The resurrected Jesus is the Prince of Peace, and by annihilating his enemies, he will usher in eternal peace. Isaiah now speaks of military paraphernalia as being totally destroyed by fire: <strong><em>“Every boot of the one tramping with tremors and the mantle rolled in blood have even come to be for burning as food for fire.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:5-23:9:5" data-bid="53-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:5</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The tremors caused by the tramping of the boots of marching soldiers will never again be felt. The bloody uniforms of combat-hardened warriors will no longer be seen. War will be no more!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:9-19:46:9" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">22. What multiple prophetic name is Jesus given in the book of Isaiah?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>At the time of his miraculous birth, the one born to be the Messiah received the name Jesus, meaning “Jehovah Is Salvation.” But he has other names, prophetic names that outline his key role and his elevated position. <span id="page130" class="pageNum" data-no="130" data-before-text="130"></span>One such name is Immanuel, meaning “With Us Is God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:14</a>, footnote) Isaiah now describes another prophetic name: <strong><em>“There has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="56-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:6</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Consider the rich meaning of this multiple prophetic name.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">23, 24. (a) In what way is Jesus a “Wonderful Counselor”? (b) How can Christian counselors today imitate Jesus’ example?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>A counselor is one who gives counsel, or advice. When on earth Jesus Christ provided wonderful counsel. In the Bible we read that “crowds were astounded at his way of teaching.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:28" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Matthew 7:28</a>) He is a wise and empathetic Counselor, with an extraordinary understanding of human nature. His counsel is not restricted to reprimands or chastisement. More often, it is in the form of instruction and loving advice. Jesus’ counsel is wonderful because it is always wise, perfect, and infallible. When followed, it leads to everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:68-43:6:68" data-bid="58-1" class="b">John 6:68</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Jesus’ counsel is not simply the product of his brilliant mind. Rather, he says: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="59-1" class="b">John 7:16</a>) As was the case with Solomon, Jehovah God is the Source of Jesus’ wisdom.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>“Mighty God” and “Eternal Father”</strong></p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">25. What does the name “Mighty God” tell us about the heavenly Jesus?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Jesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position <span id="page131" class="pageNum" data-no="131" data-before-text="131"></span>of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:2-47:1:2" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:6-50:2:6" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Philippians 2:6</a>) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="64-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>) In the Scriptures, the word “god” can mean “mighty one” or “strong one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:12-2:12:12" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Exodus 12:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> Psalm 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="65-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) Before Jesus came to earth, he was “a god,” “existing in God’s form.” After his resurrection, he returned to an even higher position in the heavens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="66-1" class="b">John 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:6-50:2:11" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Philippians 2:6-11</a>) Further, the designation “god” carries an additional implication. Judges in Israel were called “gods”​—once by Jesus himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:6-19:82:6" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Psalm 82:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:35-43:10:35" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> John 10:35</a>) Jesus is Jehovah’s appointed Judge, “destined to judge the living and the dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:1-55:4:1" data-bid="68-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:30-43:5:30" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> John 5:30</a>) Clearly, he is well named Mighty God.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">26. Why can Jesus be called “Eternal Father”?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>The title “Eternal Father” refers to the Messianic King’s power and authority to give humans the prospect of eternal life on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:25-43:11:26" data-bid="69-1" class="b">John 11:25, 26</a>) The legacy of our first parent, Adam, was death.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>“Prince of Peace”</strong></p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">27, 28. What wonderful benefits come both now and in the future to subjects of the “Prince of Peace”?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Besides everlasting life, man also needs peace, both with God and with his fellowman. Even today, those <span id="page132" class="pageNum" data-no="132" data-before-text="132"></span>subjecting themselves to the rule of the “Prince of Peace” have ‘beaten their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) They do not nurse hatreds because of political, territorial, racial, or economic differences. They are united in the worship of the one true God, Jehovah, and they work to maintain peaceful relations with their neighbors, both inside and outside the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:2-49:4:3" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:24" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 2:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>In God’s due time, Christ will establish on earth a peace that will be global, firmly established, permanent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:7-44:1:7" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Acts 1:7</a>) <strong><em>“To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="75-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:7a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>In exercising his authority as the Prince of Peace, Jesus will not resort to tyrannical means. His subjects will not be stripped of their free will and subjugated by force. Rather, all that he will accomplish will be “by means of justice and by means of righteousness.” What a refreshing change!</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">29. What should we do if we wish to enjoy the blessing of everlasting peace?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>In view of the wonderful implications of Jesus’ prophetic name, Isaiah’s conclusion to this part of his prophecy is truly thrilling. He writes: <strong><em>“The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="76-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 9:7b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Yes, Jehovah acts with zeal. He does nothing in a halfhearted way. We can be sure that whatever he promises, he will fully accomplish. If anyone, then, longs to enjoy everlasting peace, let him serve Jehovah wholeheartedly. Like Jehovah God and Jesus, the Prince of Peace, may all servants of God be “zealous for fine works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Titus 2:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JERUSALEM’S inhabitants are terrified​—and with good reason! Assyria, the mightiest empire of the day, has attacked “all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” Now, Assyria’s military machine is threatening the capital city of Judah.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Since the other cities of his land have already fallen, Hezekiah knows that Jerusalem is no match for Assyria’s powerful military force. Moreover, the Assyrians have an unparalleled reputation for cruelty and violence. That nation’s army is so fear-inspiring that opponents sometimes flee without even a fight! In view of Jerusalem’s dire circumstances, where can her inhabitants turn for help? Is there any escape from the Assyrian army? And how did God’s people get into such a situation? To answer these questions, we have to look back and see how Jehovah dealt with his covenant nation in earlier years.</p>

Israel places greater trust in horses and in war chariots than in the living God, Jehovah. To Israel’s fleshly way of thinking, Egypt’s horses are numerous and mighty. Surely Egypt will be a valuable ally against the Assyrian army! However, the Israelites will soon find that their fleshly alliance with Egypt is futile.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:3-3:26:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:3-8</a>) True to that promise, Jehovah has repeatedly proved to be a “fortress in the time of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:39-19:37:39" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 37:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:2-14:14:2" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 14:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:9-14:14:12" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 9-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:17:3-14:17:5" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 17:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:17:10-14:17:10" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> 10</a>) Moreover, through Moses, the mediator of the Law covenant, Jehovah told future kings of Israel not to increase horses for themselves.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>There is a lesson in this for Christians today. Israel looked to visible support from Egypt rather than to the far more powerful support that Jehovah provides. Likewise today, Christians may be tempted to place their confidence in fleshly sources of security​—bank accounts, social position, connections in the world—​rather than in Jehovah. Granted, Christian family heads take seriously their responsibility to provide materially for their families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) But they do not put their faith in material things.

But is not the Creator of the universe supremely wise? By all appearances Israel’s scheme to seek help from Egypt is strategically sound. Nevertheless, forming such a political alliance constitutes spiritual <span id="page320" class="pageNum" data-no="320" data-before-text="320"></span>adultery in Jehovah’s sight.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Human promises are notoriously unreliable, and human protection is uncertain. Jehovah, on the other hand, does not need to ‘call back his own words.’ He will without fail do what he promises.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Situated a few miles from Israel’s southern border is Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Isaiah’s next words are comforting to Jerusalem’s residents. He assures them that Jehovah still loves his covenant people, saying: <strong><em>“This is what Jehovah has said to me: ‘Just as the lion growls, even the maned young lion, over its prey, when there is called out against it a full number of shepherds, and in spite of their voice he will not be terrified and in spite of their commotion he will not stoop; in </em></strong><span id="page322" class="pageNum" data-no="322" data-before-text="322"></span><strong><em>the same way Jehovah of armies will come down to wage war over Mount Zion and over her hill.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:4-23:31:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 31:4</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Like a young lion standing over its prey, Jehovah will jealously protect his holy city, Zion.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Jehovah now reminds his people that they have sinned and encourages them to abandon their erring ways: <strong><em>“Return, you people, to the One against whom the sons of Israel have gone deep in their revolt.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:6-23:31:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 31:6</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The ten-tribe kingdom of Israel has not been alone in her rebellion. The people of Judah, also “sons of Israel,” have gone “deep in their revolt.” This will be especially evident when, shortly after Isaiah concludes his prophetic message, Hezekiah’s son Manasseh becomes king. According to the Bible record, “Manasseh kept seducing Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:9-14:33:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>) Imagine that!

He warns the Jewish king against relying on Jehovah for salvation and points out that the gods of other nations have been ineffective in protecting their people against the mighty Assyrian war machine.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:33-12:18:35" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Jehovah gives the sought-for direction.

This is a lesson that the inhabitants of Judah should take to heart. Despite the faithfulness of King Hezekiah, the land of Judah, like Israel, has been filled with idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:5-23:2:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:5-8</a>) For the inhabitants of Judah, rebuilding their relationship with Jehovah will require repenting of their sins and rejecting “each one his worthless gods.”​—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Exodus 34:14</a>.</p>

The cream of Assyria’s troops are devoured, not by the swords of men, but by the sword of Jehovah. As for Assyrian King Sennacherib, “he must flee because of the sword.” After the death of 185,000 of his warriors at the hand of Jehovah’s angel, he returns home.

Isaiah foretells: <strong><em>“‘His own crag will pass away out of sheer fright, and because of the signal his princes must be terrified,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, whose light is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:9-23:31:9" data-bid="38-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 31:9</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Sennacherib’s gods​—his “crag,” the refuge in which he has trusted—​fail him. They “pass away out of sheer fright,” as it were. Moreover, even Sennacherib’s princes are of little help. They too are struck with terror.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>This part of Isaiah’s prophecy provides a clear message for any would-be opposer of God. There is no weapon, no power, no device that can frustrate Jehovah’s purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:11-23:41:12" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:11, 12</a>) At the same time, those who claim to serve God yet turn away from him to seek security in fleshly things will meet with disappointment. Any who “have not looked to the Holy One of Israel” will see Jehovah “bring in what is calamitous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:1-23:31:2" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:1, 2</a>) Truly, the only real and lasting refuge is Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:5-19:37:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 37:5</a>.</p>

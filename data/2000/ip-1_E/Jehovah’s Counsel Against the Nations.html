<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 1. What judgment proclamation against Assyria does Isaiah record?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb">JEHOVAH can use the nations to discipline his people for their wickedness. Even so, he does not excuse those nations for their unnecessary cruelty, their pride, and their animosity toward true worship. Thus, long in advance he inspires Isaiah to record “the pronouncement against Babylon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:1-23:13:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 13:1</a>) However, Babylon is a future threat. In Isaiah’s day, Assyria is oppressing God’s covenant people. Assyria destroys the northern kingdom of Israel and devastates much of Judah. But Assyria’s triumph is limited. Isaiah writes: <strong><em>“Jehovah of armies has sworn, saying: ‘Surely just as I have figured, so it must occur . . . in order to break the Assyrian in my land and that I may tread him down on my own mountains; and that his yoke may actually depart from upon them and that his very load may depart from upon their shoulder.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:24-23:14:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 14:24, 25</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Not long after Isaiah utters this prophecy, the Assyrian threat is removed from Judah.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What, though, of other nations that are enemies of God’s covenant people? They too must be judged. Isaiah declares: <strong><em>“This is the counsel that is counseled against all the earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out against </em></strong><span id="page190" class="pageNum" data-no="190" data-before-text="190"></span><strong><em>all the nations.

It is his firm determination, his decree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:20-24:49:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 49:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:30-24:49:30" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 30</a>) God’s “hand” is his applied power. In the final verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:29-23:14:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 14 vss 29-32</a> and in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:19:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa chapters 15 to 19</a>, Jehovah’s counsel is against Philistia, Moab, Damascus, Ethiopia, and Egypt.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>However, Isaiah says that Jehovah’s hand is stretched out against “all the nations.” Hence, while these prophecies of Isaiah are first fulfilled in ancient times, they also apply in principle during “the time of the end” when Jehovah stretches out his hand against all the kingdoms of the earth.

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"> 4. What are some details of Jehovah’s pronouncement against Philistia?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The Philistines receive attention first. <strong><em>“In the year that King Ahaz died this pronouncement occurred:</em></strong> <strong><em>‘Do not rejoice, O Philistia, any one of you, just because the staff of the one striking you has been broken. For out of the root of the serpent there will come forth a poisonous snake, and its fruit will be a flying fiery snake.’”​</em>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:28-23:14:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 14:28, 29</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">5, 6. (a) In what way was Uzziah like a serpent to the Philistines? (b) What does Hezekiah prove to be against Philistia?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>King Uzziah was strong enough to contain the threat posed by Philistia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:6-14:26:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:6-8</a>) To them, he was like a serpent, and his staff kept striking that unfriendly <span id="page191" class="pageNum" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>neighbor. After Uzziah died​—‘his staff was broken’—​the faithful Jotham ruled, but “the people were yet acting ruinously.” Next, Ahaz became king. Things changed, and the Philistines conducted successful military raids on Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:27:2-14:27:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 27:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:17-14:28:18" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 28:17, 18</a>) Now, however, things are changing again. In 746 B.C.E., King Ahaz dies and the young Hezekiah takes the throne. If the Philistines feel that things will continue in their favor, they are sadly mistaken. Hezekiah proves to be a deadly foe. A descendant of Uzziah (the “fruit” from his “root”), Hezekiah is like “a flying fiery snake”​—rapidly darting to the attack, striking in a lightninglike fashion, and producing a burning effect, as if injecting his victims with venom.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>This is an apt description of the new king. “It was [Hezekiah] that struck down the Philistines clear to Gaza and also its territories.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:8-12:18:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:8</a>) According to the annals of Assyrian King Sennacherib, the Philistines become subjects of Hezekiah. <strong><em>“The lowly ones”​</em></strong>—the weakened kingdom of Judah—​get to enjoy security and material plenty, while Philistia suffers famine.​<strong><em>—Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:30-23:14:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 14:30,</em></strong> <strong><em>31</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>It seems that ambassadors are present in Judah​—perhaps seeking an alliance against Assyria. What should they be told? <strong><em>“What will anyone say in answer to the messengers of the nation?” </em></strong>Should Hezekiah seek security <span id="page192" class="pageNum" data-no="192" data-before-text="192"></span>in foreign alliances? No! He should tell the messengers: <strong><em>“Jehovah himself has laid the foundation of Zion, and in her the afflicted ones of his people will take refuge.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:32-23:14:32" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 14:32</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>The king must have full trust in Jehovah.

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 8. (a) How have some nations today been like Philistia? (b) As he did in ancient times, what has Jehovah done to support his people today?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Like Philistia, some nations today viciously oppose God’s worshipers. Christian Witnesses of Jehovah have been confined in prisons and concentration camps. They have been banned. A number have been killed. Opponents continue to “make sharp attacks on the soul of the righteous one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:21-19:94:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 94:21</a>) To their enemies, this Christian group may seem “lowly” and “poor.” However, with Jehovah’s support, they enjoy spiritual plenty, while their enemies suffer famine.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>East of the Dead Sea is another neighbor of Israel​—Moab. Unlike the Philistines, the Moabites are related to Israel, being descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:37-1:19:37" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 19:37</a>) Despite that relationship, Moab has a history of enmity with Israel. For example, back in the days of Moses, the king of Moab hired the prophet Balaam, hoping that he would curse the Israelites.

Tiglath-pileser III mentioned Salamanu of Moab among the rulers who paid tribute to him. Sennacherib received tribute from Kammusunadbi, king of Moab. Assyrian monarchs Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal referred to Moabite Kings Musuri and Kamashaltu as being their subjects. Centuries ago, the Moabites ceased to exist as a people. Ruins of cities thought to be Moabite have been found, but little physical evidence of this once-powerful enemy of Israel has thus far been unearthed.</p>

However, Jehovah will send a Grand Savior, the King Jesus Christ, to liberate all the meek ones. When these last days reach their climax at the war of Armageddon, he will bring relief and everlasting blessings to God-fearing humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:2-19:72:2" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Psalm 72:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:4-19:72:4" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:7-19:72:7" data-bid="100-3" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:14" data-bid="100-4" class="b"> 12-14</a>.</p>

Thus, people from all nations are united in ‘rendering service.’ There are no nationalistic divisions among these ones.

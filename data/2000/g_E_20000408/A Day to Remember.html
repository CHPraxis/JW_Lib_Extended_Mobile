<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>A Day to Remember</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE evening before he died, Jesus instituted a memorial of his death. It was a simple ceremony. During it he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This year the anniversary of this event falls on Wednesday, April 19, after sunset.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As a result, Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathered on this special night to observe this Memorial in the manner Jesus requested. You are most warmly invited to join them as observers. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.</p>

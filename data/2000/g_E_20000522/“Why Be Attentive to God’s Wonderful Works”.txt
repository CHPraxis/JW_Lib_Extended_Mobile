Come, hear the free public discourse
“Why Be Attentive to God’s Wonderful Works”
BEGINNING this month the above talk will be delivered as a highlight at 181 three-day “Doers of God’s Word” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the continental United States. Of these conventions, 38 will be held in Spanish, and 17 in 12 languages other than English. The above theme will be featured at more than 2,000 such conventions in over 150 countries throughout the world.
During the 20th century, humans accomplished amazing things and no doubt in the 21st century will accomplish many more. But how these human works pale in comparison with God’s accomplishments! No wonder an ancient wise man urged: “Stand still and show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God”!—Job 37:14.
What lessons should we draw from the creations around us, such as the tides, the rain, the snow, and the wind? How should the source of these influence our lives today? These and other questions will be answered during the discourse.
Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally or write to the publishers of this magazine for the location of the convention nearest you. The February 15th issue of our companion magazine, The Watchtower, lists the addresses of all convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.

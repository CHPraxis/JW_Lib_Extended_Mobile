<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>They are powerful for educating people about the Bible and Jehovah’s Witnesses. They have motivated many to take a firm stand for the truth. They have strengthened the faith and the appreciation of God’s dedicated people. What are they? The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization. Have you viewed all ten of them? How recently? Do you use them in your ministry? The release of the 11th video, <em>Our Whole Association of Brothers, </em>was announced at the district convention. Have you ordered it? How can you benefit all the more from these wonderful tools?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"> <sup>2 </sup>The July 1, 1999, <em>Watchtower </em>article “Regularly Study God’s Word as a Family” made the recommendation to “set aside part of your study time to watch a portion of one of the Society’s instructive videos . . . and then discuss it.” In harmony with that good advice, a different video will be featured on the Service Meeting every other month. We encourage everyone in the congregation to watch the video at home prior to when it will be discussed at the Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"> <sup>3 </sup>This month we begin with the first video that we produced, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—The Organization Behind the Name. </em>Watch and listen for the answers to these questions:</p>

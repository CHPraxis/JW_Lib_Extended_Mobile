Tools That Educate, Motivate, and Strengthen
1 They are powerful for educating people about the Bible and Jehovah’s Witnesses. They have motivated many to take a firm stand for the truth. They have strengthened the faith and the appreciation of God’s dedicated people. What are they? The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization. Have you viewed all ten of them? How recently? Do you use them in your ministry? The release of the 11th video, Our Whole Association of Brothers, was announced at the district convention. Have you ordered it? How can you benefit all the more from these wonderful tools?
 2 The July 1, 1999, Watchtower article “Regularly Study God’s Word as a Family” made the recommendation to “set aside part of your study time to watch a portion of one of the Society’s instructive videos . . . and then discuss it.” In harmony with that good advice, a different video will be featured on the Service Meeting every other month. We encourage everyone in the congregation to watch the video at home prior to when it will be discussed at the Service Meeting.
 3 This month we begin with the first video that we produced, Jehovah’s Witnesses​—The Organization Behind the Name. Watch and listen for the answers to these questions:
▪ For what are Jehovah’s Witnesses best known?
▪ Everything done at Bethel is linked to what scripture?
▪ What Bible scene did you see being staged, photographed, and painted for use in the publications?
▪ What impresses you about the way our literature is prepared?
▪ From 1920 to 1990, how many pieces of literature were printed by the Society?
▪ Who especially among God’s people should reach out to qualify for Bethel service?​—Prov. 20:29.
▪ In what ways does the Bethel family set an excellent example for all of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
▪ What impresses you about the work being done at Bethel to reach as many people as possible with the good news?
▪ How is the worldwide work financed?
▪ What activity can we zealously support, and with what spirit?​—John 4:35; Acts 1:8.
▪ How do you feel about the organization behind our name?
▪ How can you use this video in the ministry?
In December we will review the video The Bible​—Accurate History, Reliable Prophecy.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The following letter was left at a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Messenger:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am writing to thank the person that probably unknowingly created a miracle in my life.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“A couple of weeks ago, my husband and I were in a heated argument. I had just said the words, ‘This is so big that I really don’t know if I can get over it.’ Right then the doorbell rang. Now I had one of Jehovah’s Witnesses at my door, and it was too late to hide.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“When I opened the door, I was really too distracted to hear what was being said. I do remember the words ‘children’ and ‘family.’ The man pulled out a book called <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>When I saw the title, I just started to cry and couldn’t stop. He looked up, and then he apologized for disturbing me, handed me the book, and left.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The miracle? The reminder that when I don’t know what to do, it’s OK because God knows. My trust needs to be in God. He even sends a messenger. Thank you.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>can benefit every member of the family. Among its instructive chapters are “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” “Maintain Peace in Your Household,” and “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family.”</p>

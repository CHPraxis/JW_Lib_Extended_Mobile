An Unusual Cemetery
BY AWAKE! CORRESPONDENT IN ECUADOR
IN THE town of Ibarra, north of Ecuador’s capital city, Quito, there is a unique cemetery—el cementerio de los pobres (the Cemetery of the Poor). What makes it unusual? The paintings on the outside wall are enlarged versions of illustrations taken directly from publications of the Watch Tower Society!a The picture in the center is a depiction of the apostle John, taken from page 7 of the book Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! Above John, in Spanish, is the text: “The Kingdom of God means righteousness and peace and joy. Romans 14:17.” To the left are the words of Matthew 11:28: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you,” from the New World Translation. Doubtless this cemetery wall serves to direct people to God’s Word.

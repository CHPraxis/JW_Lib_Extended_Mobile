“My Trust Needs to Be in God”
The following letter was left at a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
“Dear Messenger:
“I am writing to thank the person that probably unknowingly created a miracle in my life.
“A couple of weeks ago, my husband and I were in a heated argument. I had just said the words, ‘This is so big that I really don’t know if I can get over it.’ Right then the doorbell rang. Now I had one of Jehovah’s Witnesses at my door, and it was too late to hide.
“When I opened the door, I was really too distracted to hear what was being said. I do remember the words ‘children’ and ‘family.’ The man pulled out a book called The Secret of Family Happiness. When I saw the title, I just started to cry and couldn’t stop. He looked up, and then he apologized for disturbing me, handed me the book, and left.
“The miracle? The reminder that when I don’t know what to do, it’s OK because God knows. My trust needs to be in God. He even sends a messenger. Thank you.”
The book The Secret of Family Happiness can benefit every member of the family. Among its instructive chapters are “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” “Maintain Peace in Your Household,” and “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family.”

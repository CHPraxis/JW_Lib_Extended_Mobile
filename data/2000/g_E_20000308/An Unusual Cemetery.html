<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN THE town of Ibarra, north of Ecuador’s capital city, Quito, there is a unique cemetery—<em>el cementerio de los pobres </em>(the Cemetery of the Poor). What makes it unusual? The paintings on the outside wall are enlarged versions of illustrations taken directly from publications of the Watch Tower Society!<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The picture in the center is a depiction of the apostle John, taken from <a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1101988001/26-27">page 7 of the book <em>Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</em></a> Above John, in Spanish, is the text: “The Kingdom of God means righteousness and peace and joy. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:17-45:14:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 14:17</a>.” To the left are the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:28-40:11:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28</a>: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you,” from the <em>New World Translation. </em>Doubtless this cemetery wall serves to direct people to God’s Word.</p>

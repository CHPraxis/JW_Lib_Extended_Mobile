A Special Occasion—Will You Be There?
ON A memorable day over 3,500 years ago, Jehovah God had each household of the enslaved Israelites in Egypt kill a lamb or a goat and sprinkle its blood on the doorposts and lintels of their houses. That very night, God’s angel passed over the houses marked in this way but killed the firstborn sons in the homes of all the Egyptians. The Israelites were then freed. On the anniversary of that event, Jews have celebrated the Passover.
Immediately after Jesus Christ finished celebrating his last Passover with his apostles, he instituted a meal that would memorialize his sacrificial death. He handed his apostles unleavened bread and said: “Take, eat. This means my body.” Then he gave them a cup of wine and said: “Drink out of it, all of you; for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” Jesus also said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Matthew 26:26-28; Luke 22:19, 20) So Jesus commanded his followers to hold this observance of his death.
This year the anniversary of Jesus’ death falls on Wednesday, April 19, after sunset. Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will gather on this special night to observe this Memorial in the manner Jesus requested. You are most warmly invited to join us as observers. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">CONVENTIONERS were eager to obtain their copy of the newly released 320-page book, <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>How did they feel about the book? Consider what some said.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Like most teenagers, I have a difficult time enjoying the study of ancient history. So when I received my personal copy of the new book, <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>I wasn’t exactly thrilled about reading it, but I gave it a try. Boy, did I have the wrong attitude! This is one of the best books I’ve ever encountered. It is a real page-turner! I no longer feel that I’m reading about an account that happened thousands of years ago. For the first time, I feel that I can put myself in Daniel’s place. I can truly visualize what it would be like to be taken from your family, be sent to a foreign land, and have your integrity tested time and again. Thank you so much for this book.”​—<em>Anya.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“What helps me most is the unmistakable message that Jehovah is in absolute control of matters that affect his people. Through Daniel’s visions and dreams and those of others that he interpreted, it is clear that our God will never allow events to become any more or any less than what he has purposed. This strengthens the hope we have in the prophetic pictures found in the Bible regarding the new world of his making.”​—<em>Chester.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I loved the way you made Daniel come alive. I felt better acquainted with him by the way you highlighted his cares and concerns. I could better understand why Jehovah found him so desirable. During all his trials and persecutions, he wasn’t concerned about himself. His utmost concern was for Jehovah and His beautiful name. Thank you for making these points stand out.”​—<em>Joy.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“This is what we have been waiting for! Never before has it been shown how much of Daniel’s book actually applies to each of us. After reading much of the new book the evening after I received it, I just had to stop and thank Jehovah in prayer.”​—<em>Mark.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“What we didn’t expect was the impact it would have on our children. They are five and three years old. . . . While the stories of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah have always been among their favorites in <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>the presentation in the <em>Daniel’s Prophecy </em>book has affected them in a way we didn’t anticipate. Even at their young age, they seem to be able to identify with these righteous young men. What wonderful role models for our children! What a fabulous tool you have given us! Thank you, thank you so much!”​—<em>Bethel.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I felt I was right there with the young Hebrew boys as they underwent tests of their faith; and that encouraged me to examine my own faith. The review box entitled “What Did You Discern?” sounds the chapter’s content into the heart. Thank you again for another masterpiece.”​—<em>Lydia.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE comment above was made by 13-year-old Ulrike from California, U.S.A., in connection with her study of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>She wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I really appreciated the fact that you put in the chapter ‘Single-Parent Families Can Succeed!’ It helped me to be nicer and more helpful to my mom because she is a single parent. It also helped me to understand more about how she feels. I always thought I was the only one in emotional pain.” The youth concluded: “That book helped me a lot!”</p>

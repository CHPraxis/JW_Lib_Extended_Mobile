“I Always Thought I Was the Only One”
THE comment above was made by 13-year-old Ulrike from California, U.S.A., in connection with her study of the book The Secret of Family Happiness. She wrote:
“I really appreciated the fact that you put in the chapter ‘Single-Parent Families Can Succeed!’ It helped me to be nicer and more helpful to my mom because she is a single parent. It also helped me to understand more about how she feels. I always thought I was the only one in emotional pain.” The youth concluded: “That book helped me a lot!”

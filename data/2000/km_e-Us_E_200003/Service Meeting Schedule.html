<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Should I Report Serious Wrongdoing? An earnest talk by an elder, directed toward young people. Many problems have developed in modern society that have had a detrimental effect on young people: decaying moral standards, increasing violence, addiction to drugs, and lack of respect for authority. Some teenagers live a double life, hiding their misconduct. This poses a real threat to the spiritual well-being of the whole congregation. Some commit serious wrongdoing and want to keep it secret. If you learn that a brother or a sister in the congregation has done something that is a serious violation of God’s law, what should you do? Consider the principle set out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:1-3:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:1</a>. (See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:1997607/7:168-34$p/E:1997608/">August 15, 1997, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 27-30</a>.) Refer to <em>Young People Ask </em>book, pages 68-9, and explain what a person should do in such a case.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in April and May should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation each month.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ This issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>contains the complete study schedule for the book <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>You may want to photocopy it and insert it in your personal copy of the book for handy reference.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held Wednesday, April 19, 2000. If your congregation normally has meetings on Wednesday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation’s monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all who are interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>

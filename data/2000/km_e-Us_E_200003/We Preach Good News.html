<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What a wonderful privilege we have to be the bearers of “good news of good things!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:15-45:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:15</a>) We have a refreshing message to share with people who are surrounded by turmoil and despair. How can we help them recognize that we are offering <em>“good </em>news of something better”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 52:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Prepare a Positive Message: </strong>Our conversations in the ministry will have a wholesome effect if we focus on good things. Therefore, when preparing our presentation and reviewing the publication we will offer, we need to highlight positive aspects of the message. By imparting our Bible-based hope with confidence and enthusiasm, we can expect encouraging results.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:11-20:25:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 25:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Although we are sympathetic when people express how they have been affected by worsening world conditions, we should point out to them the real solution to man’s problems, God’s Kingdom. Even when discussing Jehovah’s coming “day of vengeance,” we want to show how this really means “good news to the meek ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 61:1, 2</a>) We can reassure our listeners that everything Jehovah does will ultimately bring the greatest happiness and the best possible outcome.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Present the Truth With Real Joy: </strong>When people notice our joyful countenance and confident tone of voice, they are more apt to listen. If we reflect an optimistic outlook, our listeners will perceive that we “rejoice in the hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) Thus, they may be more inclined to respond to the good news. Certainly, we have good reason always to display a positive, joyful attitude in every aspect of our ministry.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>As ministers of the good news, we do far more than inform. Our preaching imparts a sure hope of a better life now as well as in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:8</a>) As we approach each person, our positive frame of mind will be reflected in what we say and will help people to accept the good news. By paying attention to what we say and how we say it, let us incite honesthearted ones to embrace the exciting <em>good </em>news that we preach!</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. April and May: Individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! Have Require brochure available for interested people, and endeavor to start home Bible studies. June: What Does God Require of Us? Concentrate on starting home Bible studies.
▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in April and May should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation each month.
▪ This issue of Our Kingdom Ministry contains the complete study schedule for the book Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! You may want to photocopy it and insert it in your personal copy of the book for handy reference.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ The Memorial will be held Wednesday, April 19, 2000. If your congregation normally has meetings on Wednesday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.
▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.
▪ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made each month before the congregation’s monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all who are interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.
▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more persons planning to visit the Society’s facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the Society’s facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The Society will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. LODGING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CONGREGATION ELDERS AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONGREGATION SECRETARY. Before your visit, please review the March 1998 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.
▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in Awake! of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.

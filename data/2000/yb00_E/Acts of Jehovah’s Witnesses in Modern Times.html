<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Britain</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you live where the good news has been preached for many years, what opportunity is there today to have a meaningful ministry? Jehovah’s Witnesses have been preaching in Britain for 118 years. Yet, many doors of opportunity continue to be open for British Witnesses who put the doing of Jehovah’s will first. Much can be learned from the spirit they show.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Czech Republic</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For 46 years Jehovah’s Witnesses were banned in what is now the Czech Republic. The tests of loyalty that they faced furnish many lessons that can benefit every true Christian. During those years of oppression, Jehovah continued to sustain his people spiritually. The things that he provided and the ways in which he did this are marvelous indeed.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Madagascar</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Many plants and animals that are found nowhere else on earth thrive in Madagascar. But of even greater importance to Jehovah’s Witnesses are the people who show an interest in the Creator of these things. On this Big Red Island, attendance at the annual Memorial of Christ’s death grew from 7 in 1956 to 46,392 in 1999.</p>

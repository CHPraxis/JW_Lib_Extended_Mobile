2000 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 1999
“We are not the sort that shrink back . . . but the sort that have faith.”
Pressures of many kinds put our faith to the test. As the end of the old system draws near, such pressures are increasing. But people who have genuine faith do not shrink back. How timely is the encouragement in the above scripture at Hebrews 10:39, which has been designated our yeartext for the year 2000!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Appreciation for what Jesus Christ unselfishly accomplished for mankind should move all of us to use our abilities, energies, and strengths in a self-sacrificing way. The Scriptures entreat: “Present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1</a>) Periodic self-examination will help you to see if you are showing that sort of spirit as fully as your personal circumstances allow.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>In the Pursuit of Bible Knowledge: </strong>Have you set aside time for personal Bible reading and study on a regular basis? Do you hold to that schedule? Is it your routine to prepare well for congregation meetings? If you are a family head, do you have a regular Bible study with your household? Doing these things may require sacrificing time spent in front of the television or at the computer or in other pursuits. However, what a small sacrifice to make, knowing that time spent with God’s Word will help lead you to everlasting life!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>In the Training of Your Children: </strong>The best time to begin learning a course of self-sacrifice is in childhood. Teach your children that while there is a time for play, there must also be a time for work and for theocratic activities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) Give them some useful work to do around the house. Establish a regular schedule to have a share in the ministry with them. Reinforce your instruction with your own good example.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>In Congregational Activities: </strong>A congregation is enriched when everyone in it makes willing sacrifices to accomplish things for the common good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 13:16</a>) Is it possible for you to spend more time in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work? Can you volunteer to assist the sick or the elderly, perhaps helping them with transportation to the meetings?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Prior to making the ultimate sacrifice of his human life, Jesus counseled his disciples to focus their eyes on Kingdom interests, making everything else in life secondary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) Pursuing such a spirit of self-sacrifice will bring us the greater happiness as we continue serving Jehovah with rejoicing.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As a hurricane nears a populated area, the need to warn people of the impending danger becomes urgent. The closer the hurricane comes, the more emphatic the warnings must be. Why? Because lives are at stake! Some people may not have heard previous warnings. Others may have heard but neglected to take action. The same is true of the divine warning that we have been commissioned to sound before “the storm wind” of God’s righteous anger blows away all vestiges of this wicked world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:25-20:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 10:25</a>) The eternal lives of billions of people are at stake! The warning must be sounded. We must be “zealous for fine works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:11-56:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Titus 2:11-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>For decades, Jehovah’s people have been motivated to make the Memorial season a time for special zeal in the ministry. In the spring of 1939, the <em>Informant, </em>forerunner of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>provided this encouragement: “With spring coming on, and good weather, we should expect the hours in the field to be doubled by [congregation] publishers, and the pioneers’ time materially increased. April is a five-Sunday month. It has also five Saturdays. Make every Saturday and Sunday during April . . . a time of special witnessing.” That was an ambitious goal set for the brothers 60 years ago! This year, just as in 1939, the month of April has five full weekends. What are your plans this month? What notations have you made on your calendar for April 2000? Plan to have a meaningful share in fine works with the rest of Jehovah’s people during this special month of accelerated spiritual activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>What We Hope to Accomplish: </strong>The most important day of the year 2000 falls in this month. It is April 19, the anniversary of Jesus’ death. Let us make a special effort to <em>invite as many people as possible to the Memorial. </em>As was suggested last month, make a list of all potential Memorial attenders and check that none are overlooked. Those invited should include any inactive publishers, Bible students, return visits, those who previously studied, work associates, schoolmates, neighbors, relatives, and other acquaintances. Do those who want to attend have transportation? If not, can you lovingly assist? On the night of the Memorial, all of us will have the privilege of making those who attend feel welcome. After the Memorial, we can follow up with additional spiritual assistance for such interested ones.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Being “zealous for fine works” during the days before and after the Memorial is a fine way to show Jehovah that we truly appreciate all that he has done for us. Longer daylight hours and better weather in most areas will enable many of us to <em>increase our efforts in the evangelizing activity. </em>If you are auxiliary pioneering, you will want to do your best to spend 50 hours or more in the ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>) Stick closely to the schedule you worked out at the start of the month. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:40</a>) May the rest of us do what we can to extend a supportive hand to all the pioneers, both by encouraging them and by working with them in the field. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:15-12:10:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Kings 10:15, 16</a>.) If we zealously sow during April, we can expect great joy and a blessing from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mal. 3:10</a>) Perhaps this will serve as a stepping-stone to continuous auxiliary pioneering or to regular pioneering. May the spiritual momentum that we gain in April carry over into succeeding months as we continue to be regular Kingdom publishers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Undoubtedly, thousands of Jehovah’s people this month will <em>start more home Bible studies. </em>Would you like to start one? Pray specifically for a study, and work in harmony with your prayers. You can be sure that Jehovah will appreciate your humble requests for help in finding an honesthearted person to teach.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:22-62:3:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 3:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Here is a field-tested approach that has been successfully used to start conversations. You begin by asking: “Do you think that all the violence in public schools is the result of demonic activity, or does it come from a lack of parental training?” Allow for a response. If the person says “demonic activity,” read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 12</a>, and highlight the Devil’s role in promoting turmoil in the world. Then open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996044/"><em>Require </em>brochure to <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>lesson 4</a>, and ask if the person ever wondered where the Devil came from. Proceed to read and discuss the first two paragraphs. If the person chooses “a lack of parental training” as the reason for violence in the schools, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a> and point out the traits that evidently contribute to this problem. Then open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996048/"><em>Require </em>brochure to lesson 8</a>, read paragraph 5, and continue the discussion. If you can make an appointment to return, you may be well on your way to having a regular Bible study with the person. During a subsequent visit, ask him if he knows anyone else who might be interested in hearing what he is learning.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Another way to be “zealous for fine works” during April is to <em>share in various avenues of preaching. </em>Have you been thinking about witnessing in a park or a parking lot? At a bus stop or a train station? Or would you like to try witnessing by telephone, on the street, or in business territory? Why not turn those thoughts into reality this month? Jehovah will help you muster up the necessary boldness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 4:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:2-52:2:2" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 2:2b</a>) Perhaps you can make an appointment to work with a pioneer or a publisher who is experienced in these facets of the ministry.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Anyone desirous of increasing his share in the witness work will want to <em>participate in informal witnessing. </em>Often all it takes is engaging a person in a friendly conversation. Simply raise a subject of common interest, perhaps using the approach highlighted in paragraph 6. Strive to make good use of even small increments of time that otherwise would be lost. We do not discard nickels, dimes, or quarters just because they are not full dollars. Why not profitably use even five minutes, ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour witnessing informally?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><strong>A Time for Reflection: </strong>Think back to the powerful points that were made in the drama at the “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention last year. The drama, entitled <em>Appreciating Our Spiritual Heritage, </em>made us think carefully about the contrast between Jacob and Esau. Esau <em>said </em>that like Jacob, he had interest in spiritual things, but Esau’s works did not show it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:29-1:25:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 25:29-34</a>) What a powerful warning for us! Like Jacob, let us be ready to struggle, even wrestle, for Jehovah’s blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:24-1:32:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 32:24-29</a>) Why not use April and all ensuing months to renew our zeal, never taking our wonderful spiritual heritage for granted?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>“The great day of Jehovah is near. It is near, and there is a hurrying of it very much.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:14</a>) The Kingdom good news must be sounded forth. Lives are at stake! May this month prove to be especially blessed for all of Jehovah’s people as we unitedly show that we are “zealous for fine works.”</p>

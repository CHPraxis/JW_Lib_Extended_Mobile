Zeal That Stirs Up the Majority
The apostle Paul commended the Corinthians because their zeal for a good work had “stirred up the majority” of their fellow Christians. (2 Cor. 9:2) Often, an individual, a family, a book study group, or an entire congregation can have a similar effect by the zealous share they have in the evangelizing work. Here are some ways that you may be able to show zeal for the ministry.
▪ Reserve your Saturdays for Magazine Day activity.
▪ Participate in some field service on Sundays.
▪ Use longer daylight hours to share in evening witnessing.
▪ Take part in any special witnessing days that are arranged.
▪ Use a holiday from work or school to go in service.
▪ Support the ministry during the circuit overseer’s visit.
▪ Auxiliary pioneer one or more months during the year.
▪ Adjust your circumstances to regular pioneer if possible.

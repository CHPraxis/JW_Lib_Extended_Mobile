<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Who should receive a district convention lapel badge card?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Convention lapel badge cards can be very helpful in identifying our brothers and in advertising the convention. However, they should not be distributed indiscriminately. They identify the wearer as being in good standing with a particular congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The card has space for the name of the individual as well as the name of the congregation. Therefore, the person would have to be associated to a reasonable extent with the named congregation. The Society sends a supply of cards to each congregation. It would be appropriate to give a card to each baptized and unbaptized publisher. Also, children and others who regularly attend congregation meetings and who are making progress toward sharing in the field ministry may receive one. It would not be proper to give a convention lapel badge card to a disfellowshipped person.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When the cards are made available, the elders should see that they are distributed in harmony with these guidelines.</p>

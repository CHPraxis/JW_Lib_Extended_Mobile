<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The apostle Paul commended the Corinthians because their zeal for a good work had “stirred up the majority” of their fellow Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:2-47:9:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:2</a>) Often, an individual, a family, a book study group, or an entire congregation can have a similar effect by the zealous share they have in the evangelizing work. Here are some ways that you may be able to show zeal for the ministry.</p>

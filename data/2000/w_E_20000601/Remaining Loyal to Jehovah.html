<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LOYALTY, though a rare commodity today, is a quality that characterizes servants of the true God, Jehovah. The loyal person remains steadfast through trials and unwavering despite the passing of time. Consider good King Hezekiah. “After him there proved to be no one like him among all the kings of Judah, even those who had happened to be prior to him,” the Bible states. What made Hezekiah unique? He “kept sticking to Jehovah,” even though he was surrounded by worshipers of the false god Molech. Yes, Hezekiah “did not turn aside from following [Jehovah], but he continued keeping his commandments.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:18:1-12:18:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The apostle Paul was another person who remained loyal to Jehovah. The record of his ministry as found in the Christian Greek Scriptures bears eloquent testimony to Paul’s constancy in rendering whole-souled service to God. Toward the end of his earthly life, Paul could say of himself: “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:7-55:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What fine examples of loyalty we have in Hezekiah and Paul! May we imitate their faith by remaining loyal to our Grand God, Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>.</p>

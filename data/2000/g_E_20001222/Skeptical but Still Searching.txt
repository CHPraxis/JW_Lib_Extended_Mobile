Skeptical but Still Searching
IN A letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Slovenia, a man who said that he was baptized as a Roman Catholic requested: “Please send me a copy of the brochure What Does God Require of Us? I would also like some information as to how I could regularly receive the Awake! magazine at my home.”
The man explained: “Please don’t misunderstand me. I’m rather a skeptic when it comes to religion, but I was almost shocked when I read Awake! as it was not at all dogmatic but explained things in a very straightforward and instructive manner. Just look at the Roman Catholic weekly magazine Družina [Family], which literally brainwashes people, telling them who they should vote for—who is for us and who isn’t.”
The man explained why he had not filled out the coupon on the back of Awake! to request the Require brochure but had chosen to write a personal letter instead. “I did not want to ruin the Awake! magazine,” he said. “I wanted to keep it whole!”
The 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? contains 16 lessons. In these the basic teachings of the Bible are identified and information is presented from the Bible to show what we need to do to receive God’s approval. If you too would like to request a copy of this brochure, fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

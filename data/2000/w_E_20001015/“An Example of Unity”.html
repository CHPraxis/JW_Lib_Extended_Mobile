<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT was the title of an editorial published in a newspaper in Indaiatuba, São Paulo, Brazil. Who provided the example? “Jehovah’s Witnesses, who plan to build a new ‘Kingdom Hall,’ as their temples or auditoriums are called, are giving a positive and concrete example of cooperation that cannot be ignored,” explained the writer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The unity among Jehovah’s Witnesses is evident on such occasions. Thus, the article pointed out: “It is moving to see men, women, and teenage volunteers willingly working together to build a place where they can meet together and worship God.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses set a good example in other respects as well. “In addition to studying and praying, their aim is to rehabilitate alcoholics and drug addicts and point out to people the way of solidarity and love,” added the editorial. How do they achieve this? The Witnesses know that learning and applying Bible counsel helps a person break free from vices. That is why they strive to teach others what they have learned from the Bible. The editorial concludes that theirs is “an example which, without doubt, urgently needs to be followed.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses are open to the public and no collections are taken. You are warmly invited to visit a Kingdom Hall near you.</p>

If people already have these, either the Live Forever book or the Creation book may be used.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2001 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, East Armenian, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.
▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 2001 service year is being sent to each congregation. Please use these forms with discretion. They should be used only for their intended purpose.
▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31, 2000, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the Literature Inventory form (S-18). The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servants in each congregation in the literature group. Each coordinating congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S-18). Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. The secretary and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form.
▪ From August 25, 2000, to August 26, 2000, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand at Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.

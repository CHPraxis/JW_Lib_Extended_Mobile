<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Should the congregation have a master territory map displayed in the Kingdom Hall?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, a master territory map should be mounted in a frame and displayed on a wall in the Kingdom Hall. The map should not be placed on the information board. It should show the overall boundaries of the congregation’s assigned territory and the boundaries of each individual territory with its assigned number. The territory boundaries of all the congregations using the same Kingdom Hall should be indicated. This will help publishers and newly interested ones alike to determine in which congregation’s territory they live. Showing Congregation Book Study locations on the map will also help all in locating the book study to which they are assigned. The map should be kept up-to-date.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Displaying such a map serves as a reminder to all publishers that, if possible, it would be good to have a personal territory assignment. The map is helpful to those who want to select a territory near their home. It may at times be a time-saver at meetings for service, enabling the conductor to direct each group of publishers quickly to the area where they are assigned to work.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The map also gives evidence that the congregation is organized to preach the Kingdom message thoroughly in its assigned territory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:6-42:9:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 9:6</a>.</p>

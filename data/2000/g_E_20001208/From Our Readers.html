<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Twentieth Century  </strong>Congratulations on the informative and educational work you are doing. As a political and military affairs correspondent, I am always critical about the articles I read. But the series “The 20th Century—Critical Years of Change” was second to none. (December 8, 1999) The cover illustration well reflected the most significant events of this century.</p>

I work at an institute where melatonin is being researched, and it appears that your item was inaccurate. If melatonin is involved in seasonal depression, it is an excess rather than a lack of this hormone that is to blame.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>It now appears that the exact relationship of melatonin to seasonal depression—if any—is unconfirmed. Recently, researchers have suggested that the issue may be, not the level of melatonin, but how a lack of light might disrupt the cycle of melatonin production. Obviously, more research will need to be done before any firm conclusions can be drawn.—ED.</em></p>

He said that the EKG (electrocardiogram) strip on the cover was backward.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>The strip appeared as an artistic device. It was shown to some health-care workers before its publication; however, the consensus among other medical personnel who have seen the drawing since then is that it was drawn incorrectly. We apologize for the error.—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Quitting Smoking  </strong>Until quite recently, I have been hooked on cigarettes, marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine. I tried many times to quit on my own but without success. It wasn’t until I started to study the Bible with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses that I began to feel that I was worth something. With the help of Jehovah, I have not done any drugs or smoked since January. The withdrawal symptoms have been agonizing. Since January, I haven’t had a good night’s sleep. The March 22, 2000, issue with the series “How You Can Quit Smoking” helped me to see that my difficulty with sleep is a withdrawal symptom and that I am not going crazy! Thanks so much.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When I read your description of nicotine withdrawal, it reminded me of what I went through. At first I couldn’t think of anything but cigarettes. Gradually days, then weeks, and then months passed without cigarettes ever coming into my mind. Jehovah definitely helped me after I promised myself that I would never smoke again. That was 20 years ago, and, in fact, I have never smoked again.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Moths  </strong>Thank you very much for printing the article “When Love Is Blind,” about the emperor moth. (March 22, 2000) I found one in my backyard. When a second one came along, I took a photo that was shown on local TV. I deeply appreciate the hard work and research involved in providing the magazines.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>El Niño  </strong>I want to thank you for the informative article “What Is El Niño?” (March 22, 2000) To be honest, I’d heard everyone talk about El Niño in 1998, and I didn’t have a clue as to what it was all about. Well, the explanation was delivered right to my door! Your article was short yet very informative.</p>

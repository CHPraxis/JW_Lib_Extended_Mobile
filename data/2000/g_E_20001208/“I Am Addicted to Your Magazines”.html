<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter recently received by the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in Germany read in part:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I must admit that I am addicted to your magazines. It’s the same story every year. Just before going on vacation, I decide to hold back the last two issues for reading on the beach. A firm decision!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“But as soon as I get my hands on them, the problem starts. Just a peek at the table of contents. Wow, a life story! Well, maybe I’ll read it just as an appetizer but nothing more. Oh, but the next article looks especially interesting. Stop! I need the magazines for vacation reading. Oh well, just one more article. And the “Watching the World” items are always so informative! Finally, as you can imagine, by the time I get to the beach, there is not a single article left.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The appeal of <em>Awake! </em>is demonstrated by the fact that about 20,300,000 copies are printed per issue in 82 languages. Readers enjoy its positive outlook. “Why <em>Awake! </em>Is Published,” which appears in each issue, explains that “this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yet, many ask, ‘Why has God permitted suffering for so long?’ That question is answered in the brochure <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>You can request a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">□ Send me a copy of the brochure <em>Does God Really Care About Us?</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.</p>

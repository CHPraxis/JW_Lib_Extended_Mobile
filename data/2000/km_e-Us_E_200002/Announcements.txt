Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: The Secret of Family Happiness. March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. April and May: Individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! Have Require brochure available for interested people, and endeavor to start home Bible studies.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s annual S-201 letters dated October 1. See also paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ On Saturday, May 13, 2000, the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.
▪ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes, or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the regional committee by letter.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.
▪ On occasion the Society issues a check to an individual, and the payee decides not to cash it, thinking that it will be viewed as a donation to the worldwide work. Please be advised that after a period of time, such checks are viewed as unclaimed property, and the funds have to be turned over to the State. If a person wants to donate the amount of the check, he should return the check to the Society with a brief note stating that it is to be considered as a donation.
▪ Beginning the week of April 17, 2000, we will study Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! in the Congregation Book Study.
▪ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories may be worked by special pioneers or are accessible to nearby congregations.

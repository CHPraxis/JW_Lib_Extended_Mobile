<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>With the above words, Paul described Tryphaena and Tryphosa, two hardworking sisters in the Rome congregation. Of another, Persis, he said: “She performed many labors in the Lord.” He likewise made favorable mention of Phoebe as “a defender of many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:2-45:16:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 16:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:12-45:16:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) In the Scriptures, Dorcas was singled out as one who “abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 9:36</a>) What a blessing spiritual women are to the congregation!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Do we appreciate the sisters who work hard in our congregation? They do the bulk of the preaching work, conduct most of the Bible studies, and assist many of the new ones. They also spend considerable time in helping children to make spiritual progress. Christian women do their part in building up the spirit of love, joy, peace, and zeal in the congregation. They are supportive in many ways so that their husbands and other family members can do more in Jehovah’s service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Sisters in Full-Time Service: </strong>Among those who labor very hard in the Lord are missionary sisters, many having shared in developing the work in foreign lands. In the congregations served by their husbands, the wives of traveling overseers are busy in the field ministry, encouraging many sisters. Not to be overlooked are the Bethel sisters, who zealously perform sacred service in support of Jehovah’s organization. And our regular pioneer sisters, by their faithful efforts in praising God, are helping thousands to learn the truth.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>These faithful women find great satisfaction in their self-sacrificing way of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>) They are worthy of commendation and whatever encouragement and support we can give them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Christian women are a valuable asset to Jehovah’s organization, performing faithful service that is a blessing to all. May we continue to appreciate such women and pray that Jehovah’s blessing will be with them as they keep “working hard in the Lord.”</p>

Pay Attention to How You Listen
Paying close attention is vital when attending congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. (Luke 8:18) How can you improve your listening ability?
▪ Avoid eating a heavy meal before meetings.
▪ Refuse to allow your mind to wander.
▪ Take brief notes of the main points.
▪ Look up the scriptures that are read.
▪ Participate when there is opportunity.
▪ Reflect on the material being presented.
▪ Think of ways to use what you hear.
▪ Afterward, discuss what you learned.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Is it appropriate to applaud when a reinstatement is announced?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In his loving-kindness, Jehovah God has provided a Scriptural way for repentant wrongdoers to regain his favor and achieve reinstatement in the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:12-19:51:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 51:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:17-19:51:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17</a>) When this takes place, we are encouraged to confirm our love for such sincerely repentant ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:6-47:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even so, as joyful as we are when a relative or acquaintance is reinstated, a quiet dignity should prevail at the time that the person’s reinstatement is announced in the congregation. <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1998725/21:577-23:242">The <em>Watchtower </em>of October 1, 1998, page 17</a>, expressed matters this way: “We must remember, however, that most in the congregation are not aware of the particular circumstances that led to a person’s expulsion or to his reinstatement. In addition, there may be some who have been personally affected or hurt​—perhaps even on a long-term basis—​by the wrongdoing of the repentant one. Being sensitive to such matters, therefore, when an announcement of reinstatement is made, we would understandably withhold expressions of welcome until such can be made on a personal basis.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although we are very happy to see someone return to the truth, applause at the time of his or her reinstatement would not be appropriate.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for September: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Starting in the latter part of the month, Kingdom News No. 36 will be distributed. November: Distribution of Kingdom News No. 36 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each dwelling with a copy of Kingdom News No. 36 may offer the Require brochure or the Knowledge book. If people already have these, either the Live Forever book or the Creation book may be used. December: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life with the New World Translation.
▪ The telephone area code for the region in which the Society’s facilities are located in Patterson and Wallkill, New York, has been changed. The new area code is 845. The area code for Brooklyn, New York, remains 718.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower, regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.
▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.
▪ The Society does not fill individual publisher’s requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made each month before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.
▪ Effective August 29, 2000, the Society is establishing two sign language circuits. These circuits will be served by traveling overseers who are conversant with American Sign Language.
▪ Beginning with the September 1, 2000, issue, The Watchtower will be available in the Azerbaijani and Tumbuka languages as monthly editions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Would you like to have a continuous supply of good ideas that will keep your ministry fresh and stir people’s interest in the Bible’s message? Then use what is happening on the world scene and in your community to start conversations. You could draw on current local and national events or international news items. These things are ever-changing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:31</a>) Consider the following examples.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>Economic problems and the cost of living are real concerns of people. Thus, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Did you hear on the news that [mention item] prices are rising again?” Or you might comment about unemployment if a large firm has laid off many workers. Depending on how you want to proceed with the discussion, you can follow up by asking either “Have you ever wondered why it is so hard to make a living?” or “Do you think that it will always be hard to make ends meet?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Reports of violence, such as tragedies in families or among school students, provide a basis for another discussion. You could ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Did you read in the newspaper that [name tragedy in the community]?” Then ask either “What do you think is the cause for so much violence in the world?” or “Do you think a time will ever come when we can feel secure?”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>News of devastating floods, earthquakes, or civil unrest in different parts of the world also offers material that stirs interest. For example, you might ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Is God responsible for [name natural disaster]?” Or you could point to the latest outbreak of civil unrest and say: “If everybody wants peace, why is it so hard to achieve?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Remain alert to current events that you can use in your introduction. Helpful suggestions are found under “Current Events,” on <a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/6-26:136">pages 10-11, in the <em>Reasoning</em></a> book. However, avoid taking sides on political or social issues. Instead, direct attention to the Scriptures and God’s Kingdom as the only permanent solution to mankind’s problems.</p>

How Will Jehovah Remember You?
“DO REMEMBER me, O my God.” A number of times Nehemiah petitioned God in those words. (Nehemiah 5:19; 13:14, 31) It is quite natural that when people are in dire straits, they turn to God with expressions of entreaty like that.
What, though, do people have in mind when they ask God to remember them? Clearly, they hope for God to do more than simply recall their names. They no doubt hope in the same way as did one of the criminals executed alongside Jesus. This one, unlike the other, implored Jesus: “Remember me when you get into your kingdom.” He wanted Jesus not only to remember who he was but also to do something for him—to resurrect him.—Luke 23:42.
Consistently, the Bible shows that with God, “remembering” means taking positive action. For example, after the earth had been inundated by the floodwaters for 150 days, “God remembered Noah . . . , and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters began to subside.” (Genesis 8:1) Centuries later, Samson, blinded and chained by the Philistines, prayed: “Jehovah, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, just this once.” Jehovah remembered Samson by giving him superhuman strength so that he could avenge himself against God’s enemies. (Judges 16:28-30) As for Nehemiah, Jehovah blessed his efforts, and true worship was restored in Jerusalem.
“All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope,” wrote the apostle Paul. (Romans 15:4) If we remember Jehovah by seeking to do his will, as his faithful servants did in the past, we can be confident that Jehovah will remember us by helping us to obtain our daily needs, by supporting us in our trials, and by delivering us when he brings judgment upon the ungodly.—Matthew 6:33; 2 Peter 2:9.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What an encouraging thought! Your labor in Jehovah’s service is not in vain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) In contrast, think of how people labor long and hard trying to improve their status in life or their financial situation. They may pursue higher education for years or work slavishly to get ahead materially. Yet, because of “time and unforeseen occurrence,” they may never attain the prestige they are seeking, or they may be forced to settle for much less than they want materially. Like “a striving after wind,” their efforts are in vain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:14-21:1:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9:11</a>) How vital, then, that we have plenty to do in the only work that is not in vain because it has lasting value!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>The Work That Really Counts: </strong>Preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom is the most important work on earth. It is the work that must be done whether people listen or not. We want to be able to say, as did Paul: “I am clean from the blood of all men, for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:26-44:20:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>When people listen and respond to the Kingdom message, what joy there is! A young woman lost her aunt in death. She wondered where her aunt had gone​—to heaven or to hell? She prayed to God for help, using the name Jehovah, as her sister had taught her to do. Soon she was studying the Bible and attending Christian meetings. She gained a whole new outlook on life and broke her ties with street gangs. The young woman quit smoking, taking drugs, and stealing. She admits: “Only love for Jehovah made me leave such a bad way of life. Only Jehovah in his great mercy could give me the hope of everlasting life.” She is no longer spending her life in vain pursuits.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Even when people refuse to listen, you still accomplish something worthwhile. They know that Jehovah’s Witnesses have visited them. Your own integrity, faithfulness, and love are confirmed. So, is your labor in the Lord’s work in vain? Never!</p>

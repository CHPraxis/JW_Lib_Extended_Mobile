What do you do when you encounter an individual who raises an unscriptural argument? The <em>Reasoning </em>book often comes to the rescue by providing practical suggestions on how to give a tactful answer. For example, although we view death as an enemy that will be conquered through Christ’s ransom, others are convinced that nothing will eliminate this eventuality, even putting faith in the false idea of reincarnation. Discuss the responses that are offered in the <em>Reasoning </em>book in the feature “If Someone Says—” on pages 103-4 and 321. Encourage everyone to carry the book in the field ministry.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Centuries ago the apostle Paul instructed Timothy to encourage fellow believers “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:18-54:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:18</a>) Paul also reminded the Hebrew Christians not to forget “the doing of good and the sharing of things with others.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 13:16</a>) Why did he write these instructions? Because he knew that there would be “glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:10-45:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>By reason of his Creatorship, Jehovah God is the Owner of all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) We certainly appreciate what he is doing in our behalf with his belongings. Despite the thankless attitude of many of humankind, the Most High continues to allow all to benefit from his generous provisions for sustaining life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 5:45</a>) He even gave his dearest Son as a sacrifice so that we might have life everlasting. Should not the love that we have been shown compel us to prove ourselves thankful by being liberal with fellow humans?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>What Can We Share? </strong>It is only right that we use whatever assets we have in a way that is pleasing in God’s sight. Surely we want to support the worldwide Kingdom work in a material and spiritual way. Of course, the good news is the most valuable treasure anyone can possess, for it is “God’s power for salvation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 1:16</a>) By liberally using our time and resources every month to participate in the preaching and teaching work, we may be able to share this spiritual treasure with others, leading to their gaining everlasting life.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jehovah is very pleased when we assist those of little means. He promises blessings, and he also reminds us: “Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, but righteousness itself will deliver from death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:4-20:11:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 19:17</a>) Supporting the Kingdom work materially and having a full share in preaching the good news are wonderful ways we can show that we really are liberal, ready to share.</p>

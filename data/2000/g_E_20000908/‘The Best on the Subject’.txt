‘The Best on the Subject’
THAT was the opinion of a Lutheran teacher from San Diego, California, U.S.A., after being given the book Mankind’s Search for God. He wrote the following expression of thanks.
“I appreciate the time and effort you have taken to give me the Witness perspective on this crazy world in which we live. I have read and reread the text on mankind’s search for God. It is the best I have read on the subject. I may not have looked into our Lutheran literature as I should have, but it appears that the Witness literature with which you have so graciously provided me is so superior to what I have seen of ours. I thank you for your continued interest in my spiritual welfare.”
Mankind’s Search for God has chapters on mythology, magic and spiritism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism, Shinto, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It also provides direction on how to worship God in the way that he approves.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT was the opinion of a Lutheran teacher from San Diego, California, U.S.A., after being given the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>He wrote the following expression of thanks.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I appreciate the time and effort you have taken to give me the Witness perspective on this crazy world in which we live. I have read and reread the text on mankind’s search for God. It is the best I have read on the subject. I may not have looked into our Lutheran literature as I should have, but it appears that the Witness literature with which you have so graciously provided me is so superior to what I have seen of ours. I thank you for your continued interest in my spiritual welfare.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A copy of the March 8, 2000, issue of <em>Awake! </em>dealing with the thorny problem of slavery, which, sadly, persists in parts of the world, was given to the Italian Minister for Social Solidarity, Livia Turco. In a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy, she acknowledged:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si">“Modern forms of slavery, affecting especially women and children, constitute a grave emergency in which millions of human beings still suffer inhuman conditions.” She concluded: “Every voice raised in indignation against this unacceptable reality is an irreplaceable contribution, and when it reaches a public as vast as the readership of [Awake!], it is even more telling.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thanks to the distribution of more than 20 million copies of each issue of <em>Awake! </em>in 82 languages, millions of readers are not only informed of the nature of today’s problems but also provided with Bible-based solutions to them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yet, the question persists, If there really is a God, why does he permit the terrible suffering of innocent people? Many wonder, ‘How can I love a Creator whose wisdom is obvious in the marvels of creation but who seemingly shows no compassion for people today?’ Such questions are answered in a satisfying way in the brochure <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>You can request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

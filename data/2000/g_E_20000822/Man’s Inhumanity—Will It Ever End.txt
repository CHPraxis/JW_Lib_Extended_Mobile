Man’s Inhumanity—Will It Ever End?
A copy of the March 8, 2000, issue of Awake! dealing with the thorny problem of slavery, which, sadly, persists in parts of the world, was given to the Italian Minister for Social Solidarity, Livia Turco. In a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy, she acknowledged:
“Modern forms of slavery, affecting especially women and children, constitute a grave emergency in which millions of human beings still suffer inhuman conditions.” She concluded: “Every voice raised in indignation against this unacceptable reality is an irreplaceable contribution, and when it reaches a public as vast as the readership of [Awake!], it is even more telling.”
Thanks to the distribution of more than 20 million copies of each issue of Awake! in 82 languages, millions of readers are not only informed of the nature of today’s problems but also provided with Bible-based solutions to them.
Yet, the question persists, If there really is a God, why does he permit the terrible suffering of innocent people? Many wonder, ‘How can I love a Creator whose wisdom is obvious in the marvels of creation but who seemingly shows no compassion for people today?’ Such questions are answered in a satisfying way in the brochure Does God Really Care About Us? You can request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

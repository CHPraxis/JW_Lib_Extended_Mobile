<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a young business administration assistant from Yucatán, Mexico, said regarding the way <em>Awake! </em>magazine covers topics. In a letter he explained that he was introduced to <em>Awake! </em>by a Witness coworker at the insurance brokerage firm where they both work.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With regard to <em>Awake!, </em>he stated: “It is a real source of information and truth. I like the way it treats matters, as it does not tend toward any political preference and does not value some people over others. I have found solutions to problems by reading this magazine. This is an attractive, well-balanced, up-to-date, enriching publication. I send you my most sincere congratulations!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some years ago <em>Awake! </em>considered the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. That information was later reedited and presented in the brochure entitled <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>Perhaps you or someone you know could be comforted by reading this 32-page brochure. You may request a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

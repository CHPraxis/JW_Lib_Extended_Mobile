“I Like the Way It Treats Matters”
That is what a young business administration assistant from Yucatán, Mexico, said regarding the way Awake! magazine covers topics. In a letter he explained that he was introduced to Awake! by a Witness coworker at the insurance brokerage firm where they both work.
With regard to Awake!, he stated: “It is a real source of information and truth. I like the way it treats matters, as it does not tend toward any political preference and does not value some people over others. I have found solutions to problems by reading this magazine. This is an attractive, well-balanced, up-to-date, enriching publication. I send you my most sincere congratulations!”
Some years ago Awake! considered the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. That information was later reedited and presented in the brochure entitled When Someone You Love Dies. Perhaps you or someone you know could be comforted by reading this 32-page brochure.

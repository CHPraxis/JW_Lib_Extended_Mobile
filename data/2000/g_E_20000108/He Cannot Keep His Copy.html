<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A businessman wrote to the Slovenia branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Thank you for regularly sending me the <em>Awake! </em>and <em>Watchtower </em>magazines. I take them with me when I travel, as I read them during the trip and while waiting for business meetings.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I would also like to request that you send me the following publications that have been mentioned in your magazines: <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?, </em>and <em>A Book for All People.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I would like to have two copies of each publication. This is because every time I read one of your publications when I am traveling, someone is very interested in what I am reading. Despite the fact that I would like to keep it for my own library, I give the person my copy.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We feel confident that you too will benefit greatly from reading the fine 32-page brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>This publication shows that our Creator has a grand purpose that is soon to be realized. You can receive a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">□ Send me a copy of the brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.</p>

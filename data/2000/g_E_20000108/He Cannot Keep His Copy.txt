He Cannot Keep His Copy
A businessman wrote to the Slovenia branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses:
“Thank you for regularly sending me the Awake! and Watchtower magazines. I take them with me when I travel, as I read them during the trip and while waiting for business meetings.
“I would also like to request that you send me the following publications that have been mentioned in your magazines: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?, and A Book for All People.
“I would like to have two copies of each publication. This is because every time I read one of your publications when I am traveling, someone is very interested in what I am reading. Despite the fact that I would like to keep it for my own library, I give the person my copy.”
We feel confident that you too will benefit greatly from reading the fine 32-page brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? This publication shows that our Creator has a grand purpose that is soon to be realized. You can receive a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.
□ Send me a copy of the brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?
□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to review pointed counsel from this month’s insert. Encourage everyone to take a few minutes to look at the printed program before each morning and afternoon session begins and anticipate what might be discussed. This will make it easier to focus attention on the program and take brief but meaningful notes. Two to four weeks following the convention, a 30-minute review of program highlights is to be scheduled on the Service Meeting. At that time, each one will be prepared to volunteer a brief comment when invited to do so by three qualified brothers assigned to handle this part. Such comments may express how what was learned at the convention applies to one’s own life and in one’s field ministry. One or two selected, brief experiences may be related. Good preparation by all is the key to making this Service Meeting part both interesting and instructive.</p>

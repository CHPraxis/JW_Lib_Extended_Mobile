<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>They returned “with joy.” The Bible account expresses how the 70 disciples felt when they reported back to Jesus, following an extended preaching tour. They experienced an inner sense of delight from doing God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:17-42:10:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 10:17</a>) What can help you to find similar joy in sacred service?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>A Positive Attitude: </strong>You have the God-given privilege of acquainting people with Jehovah’s grand purpose. By your preaching, you may help free an individual from this world’s degrading practices and the shackles of false religion. You can offer people the hope of life in a world free of the discord that surrounds us today. Think of the joy that Jehovah has when you successfully plant the seeds of truth in a receptive heart. Be positive in praying for God’s spirit to produce in you the fruit of joy as you pursue the ministry with all your heart.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Practical Training: </strong>The instruction session that Jesus conducted with the 70 disciples has been likened to a modern-day Service Meeting. He provided training so that they could effectively accomplish their ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:1-42:10:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 10:1-16</a>) Today the Service Meeting trains you in ways to approach people, how to start conversations, and how to start and conduct home Bible studies. By applying yourself and improving your preaching skills, you will find that any feelings of uneasiness or inadequacy that you may have had will diminish and be overshadowed by confidence and joy.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Focus on the Future: </strong>Jesus found joy in his sacred service despite the sufferings he endured. Why? Because he kept his eye sharply focused on the blessings and privileges that lay ahead of him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>) You can do the same by keeping your mind and heart focused on Jehovah’s name and on the blessings to come in God’s new world. This will add joy and meaning to your ministry.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Rendering sacred service to Jehovah is the greatest privilege you can have today. Therefore, may you say: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>.</p>

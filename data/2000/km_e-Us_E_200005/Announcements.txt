▪ We find it necessary to remind all publishers that the Society’s return address should never be used on any personal correspondence. This includes all letters and items of literature that are mailed to give a witness to interested people, to not-at-homes, or to those who live in inaccessible places. When witnessing by mail, use either your personal return address or the local Kingdom Hall address. Please do not use the Society’s address.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.

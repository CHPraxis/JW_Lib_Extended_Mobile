‘It Helped Me to Examine My Life’
THAT is what an 18-year-old girl named Maria from the city of Cherepovets said regarding the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. She wrote the following to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses near St. Petersburg, Russia, some 250 miles [400 km] from Cherepovets.
“This publication has helped me to examine myself, my goals, and people around me. I found answers to the questions that concern me most of all. While I was reading the book, tears of thankfulness rolled down my cheeks.”
Maria added: “It felt as if a veil had been taken off my eyes, which were wide open with excitement. This book is the best one I have read in my entire life. No other one compares to it, since it is based on the Bible and the advice of Jehovah God is the best.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is what an 18-year-old girl named Maria from the city of Cherepovets said regarding the book <em>Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. </em>She wrote the following to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses near St. Petersburg, Russia, some 250 miles <strong>[400 km] </strong>from Cherepovets.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“This publication has helped me to examine myself, my goals, and people around me. I found answers to the questions that concern me most of all. While I was reading the book, tears of thankfulness rolled down my cheeks.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Maria added: “It felt as if a veil had been taken off my eyes, which were wide open with excitement. This book is the best one I have read in my entire life. No other one compares to it, since it is based on the Bible and the advice of Jehovah God is the best.”</p>

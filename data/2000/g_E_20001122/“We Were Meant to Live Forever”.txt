“We Were Meant to Live Forever”
That was the conclusion of a man from Kasama, Zambia, regarding the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? He wrote regarding our Creator:
“Jehovah came to have new meaning altogether to me by the time I completed the book. I was especially drawn to him after I read about how intricately our bodies are made. There can be no doubt that we were meant to live forever.”
Such evidence is considered in chapter 4, entitled “How Unique You Are!” which discusses not only the physical structure of the brain but also language, intelligence, and human consciousness.
We invite you to examine the scientific evidence and see if you do not agree with the conclusion reached in the book: “The more we learn about the workings of our brain and mind, the easier it is to see why millions of people have concluded that man’s conscious existence is evidence of a Creator who cares about us.”

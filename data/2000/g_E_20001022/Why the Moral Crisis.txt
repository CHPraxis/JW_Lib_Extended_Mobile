Why the Moral Crisis
LAST October a writer in Loja, Ecuador, expressed appreciation for the ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Among other things, he observed:
“One of the worst scourges afflicting mankind is the moral crisis . . . It seems that people have forgotten to fulfill the Ten Commandments and have ignored their conscience, all of which precludes understanding among men. Everywhere and everyday, we hear about hate, violence, crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and lack of respect for human dignity. . . .
“Jehovah’s Witnesses, with little fuss, perform their duty in a peaceful and calm way, visiting their neighbors from door to door, offering their two beautiful magazines, The Watchtower and Awake!, in which most interesting articles are published. The Awake! in particular covers a variety of interesting matters of undeniable scientific and cultural content. All of this is written with admirable clarity and accuracy.”
Today’s moral crisis is obvious, but as stated on page 4 of this magazine in the section “Why Awake! Is Published,” Awake! “probes beneath the surface and points to the real meaning behind current events.” The brochure Does God Really Care About Us? acknowledges the suffering humans have endured, but it does more. It shows why the moral crisis with its terrible consequences exists. More important, it reveals how relief will soon be realized.

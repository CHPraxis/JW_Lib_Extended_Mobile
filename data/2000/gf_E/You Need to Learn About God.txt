LESSON 3
You Need to Learn About God




To be God’s friend, you need to learn about him. Do your friends know your name and use it? They do. God wants you to know and use his name too. God’s name is Jehovah. (Psalm 83:18; Matthew 6:9) You must also learn what he likes and dislikes. You need to know who his friends are and who his enemies are. It takes time to get to know someone. The Bible says that it is wise to set aside time to learn about Jehovah.​—Ephesians 5:15, 16.
God’s friends do what is pleasing to him. Think about your friends. If you treat them badly and do the things that they hate, will they continue to be your friends? Of course not! In the same way, if you want to be God’s friend, you need to do what is pleasing to him.​—John 4:24.





Not all religions lead to friendship with God. Jesus, who is God’s closest friend, spoke of two roads. One road is wide and is filled with people. That road leads to destruction. The other road is narrow and has few people traveling on it. That road leads to everlasting life. This means that if you want to have God’s friendship, you must learn the correct way to worship him.​—Matthew 7:13, 14.

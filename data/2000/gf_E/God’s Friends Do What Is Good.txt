LESSON 15
God’s Friends Do What Is Good




When you have a friend whom you admire and respect, you try to be like him. “Good and upright is Jehovah,” says the Bible. (Psalm 25:8) To be God’s friend, we must be good and upright. The Bible says: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love.” (Ephesians 5:1, 2) Here are some ways to do that:





Be helpful to others. “Let us work what is good toward all.”​—Galatians 6:10.
Work hard. “Let the stealer steal no more, but rather let him do hard work, doing with his hands what is good work.”​—Ephesians 4:28.
Keep physically and morally clean. “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.”​—2 Corinthians 7:1.





Treat your family members with love and respect. “Let each one of you . . . love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband. Children, be obedient to your parents.”​—Ephesians 5:33–6:1.
Show love to others. “Let us continue loving one another, because love is from God.”​—1 John 4:7.
Obey the laws of the land. “Let every soul be in subjection to the [government] . . . Render to all their dues, to him who calls for the tax, the tax.”​—Romans 13:1, 7.

LESSON 5
God’s Friends Will Live in Paradise




Paradise will not be like the world we live in now. God never wanted the earth to be filled with trouble and sorrow, pain and suffering. In the future, God will make the earth a paradise. What will Paradise be like? Let us see what the Bible says:





Good people. Paradise will be the home of God’s friends. They will do good things for one another. They will live according to the righteous ways of God.​—Proverbs 2:21.
Plenty of food. In Paradise, there will be no hunger. The Bible says: “There will come to be plenty of grain [or, food] on the earth.”​—Psalm 72:16.





Fine houses and enjoyable work. On the Paradise earth, every family will have a home of its own. Everyone will do work that brings true happiness.​—Isaiah 65:21-23.
Peace worldwide. No longer will people fight and die in war. God’s Word says: “[God] is making wars to cease.”​—Psalm 46:8, 9.
Good health. The Bible promises: “No resident [of Paradise] will say: ‘I am sick.’” (Isaiah 33:24) Also, no one will be lame or blind or deaf or unable to talk.​—Isaiah 35:5, 6.
An end to pain, sorrow, and death. God’s Word says: “Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”​—Revelation 21:4.
Bad people will be gone. Jehovah promises: “The wicked . . . will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.”​—Proverbs 2:22.
People will love and respect one another. No longer will there be injustice, oppression, greed, and hatred. People will be united and will live in harmony with God’s righteous ways.​—Isaiah 26:9.

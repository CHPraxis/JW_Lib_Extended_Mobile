<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s Son and his closest, dearest friend. </strong>Before he lived as a man on earth, Jesus lived in heaven as a mighty spirit creature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:5-43:17:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:5</a>) Then he came to earth to teach people the truth about God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) He also gave his human life to save obedient humans from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) Jesus is now the King of God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government that will bring Paradise to this earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:16-66:19:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 19:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>The angels are also God’s friends. </strong>The angels did not begin their lives as humans on earth. They were created in heaven before God made the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7</a>) There are millions of angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 7:10</a>) These heavenly friends of God want people to learn the truth about Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>God also has friends on the earth; he calls them his witnesses. </strong>A witness in court tells what he knows about someone or something. Jehovah’s Witnesses tell others what they know about Jehovah and his purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a>) Like the angels, the Witnesses want to help you learn the truth about Jehovah. They want you to be God’s friend too.</p>

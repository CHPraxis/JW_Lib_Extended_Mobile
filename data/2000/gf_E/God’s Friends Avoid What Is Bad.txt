LESSON 14
God’s Friends Avoid What Is Bad




Satan tempts people to do bad things. A person who wants to be God’s friend needs to hate what Jehovah hates. (Psalm 97:10) Here are some things that God’s friends avoid:





Sexual sins. “You must not commit adultery.” (Exodus 20:14) Having sex before marriage is also wrong.​—1 Corinthians 6:18.
Drunkenness. “Drunkards . . . will [not] inherit God’s kingdom.”​—1 Corinthians 6:10.
Murder, Abortion. “You must not murder.”​—Exodus 20:13.
Theft. “You must not steal.”​—Exodus 20:15.
Lying. Jehovah hates “a false tongue.”​—Proverbs 6:17.
Violence and Uncontrolled Anger. “Anyone loving violence [Jehovah] certainly hates.” (Psalm 11:5) “The works of the flesh [include] . . . fits of anger.”​—Galatians 5:19, 20.
Gambling. “Quit mixing in company with anyone . . . that is a . . . greedy person.”​—1 Corinthians 5:11.
Racial and Ethnic Hatreds. “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”​—Matthew 5:43, 44.
The things God tells us are for our good. It is not always easy to avoid doing bad things. With Jehovah’s help and with the help of his Witnesses, you can avoid doing the things that displease God.​—Isaiah 48:17; Philippians 4:13; Hebrews 10:24, 25.

LESSON 16
Show Your Love for God









To keep a friend, you need to talk with him. You listen to him, and he listens to you. You also say good things about your friend to others. It is the same with being a friend of God. Consider what the Bible says about this:
Talk to Jehovah regularly in prayer. “Persevere in prayer.”​—Romans 12:12.
Read God’s Word, the Bible. “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.”​—2 Timothy 3:16.
Teach others about God. “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”​—Matthew 28:19, 20.





Draw close to God’s friends. “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise.”​—Proverbs 13:20.
Attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall. “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, . . . encouraging one another.”​—Hebrews 10:24, 25.
Help support the Kingdom work. “Let each one [give] just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”​—2 Corinthians 9:7.

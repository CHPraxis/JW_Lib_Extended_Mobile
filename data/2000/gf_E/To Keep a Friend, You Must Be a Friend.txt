LESSON 17
To Keep a Friend, You Must Be a Friend




Friendship is based on love. The more you learn about Jehovah, the greater will be your love for him. As your love for God grows, your desire to serve him will also grow. This will move you to become a disciple of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:19) By joining the happy family of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you can experience God’s friendship forever. What must you do?
You must show your love for God by obeying his laws. “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.”​—1 John 5:3.
Apply what you learn. Jesus told a story that illustrates this. A wise man built his house on rock. A foolish man built his house on sand. When a great storm came, the house built on rock did not cave in, but the house built on sand fell with a great crash. Jesus said that those who hear his teachings and do them are like the wise man who built on rock. But those who listen to his teachings and do not do them are like the foolish man who built on sand. Which man do you want to be like?​—Matthew 7:24-27.





Dedication. This means that you go to Jehovah in prayer and tell him that you want to do his will forever. Doing God’s will shows that you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.​—Matthew 11:29.





Baptism. “Get baptized and wash your sins away by your calling upon his name.”​—Acts 22:16.





Become fully involved in serving God. “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah, and not to men.”​—Colossians 3:23.

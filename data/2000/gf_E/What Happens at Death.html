<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>Death is the opposite of life. </strong>Death is like a deep sleep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 11:11-14</a>) The dead are unable to hear, see, speak, or think anything. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10</a>) False religion teaches that the dead go to a spirit world to live with their ancestors. That is not what the Bible teaches.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Those who have died cannot help us, and they cannot harm us. </strong>It is common for people to perform rituals and sacrifices that they believe will please those who have died. This is displeasing to God because it is based on one of Satan’s lies. It cannot please the dead either, since they are lifeless. We should not fear or worship the dead. We should worship only God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 4:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>The dead will live again. </strong>Jehovah will awaken the dead to life on a paradise earth. That time is yet future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>) God can awaken those who have died just as surely as you can awaken a person from sleep.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:22-41:5:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 5:22, 23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:41-41:5:42" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 41, 42</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>The idea that we do not die is a lie spread by Satan the Devil. </strong>Satan and his demons make people think that spirits of the dead are alive and cause sickness and other problems. Satan deceives people, at times through dreams and visions. Jehovah condemns those who try to talk to the dead.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>.</p>

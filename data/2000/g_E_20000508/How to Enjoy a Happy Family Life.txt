How to Enjoy a Happy Family Life
“I HAVE been reading the Watchtower and Awake! magazines for 40 years,” writes Graciela from Argentina, South America. “Today, after so many years, I can truly say that they have fitted my needs. They helped me through childhood, during my teen years, with courtship and marriage, and in the rearing of my six children.
“The magazines help my husband and me with rearing our four children who still live at home. I make good use of the magazines to talk with my children and with their teachers at school. I have read directly from Awake! when talking with doctors about health problems. Thanks to the series of articles with the cover title “Help for Children With Learning Disabilities” (February 22, 1997), we came to realize that one of our daughters has a learning problem.”
The publications of the Watch Tower Society can help families to cope with the many problems they face and to enjoy a happy life together. For example, the 192-page book The Secret of Family Happiness can benefit husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents—yes, every member of the family. Among its instructive chapters are the following: “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Help Your Teenager to Thrive,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family.”

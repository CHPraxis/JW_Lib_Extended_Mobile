World Peace—How?
IS WORLD peace on the horizon? Many once thought so but are now skeptical. According to a report discussing challenges for our future, published in South Africa’s Daily Mail & Guardian, “predictions of a new international order made only 10 years ago now seem hopelessly optimistic.”
The authors reflect on the hopeful spirit that prevailed a mere decade ago. The Cold War had just ended, and superpower strife was no more. At what seemed to be the dawn of a new era, many expected that mankind would begin to make significant headway in tackling poverty, illness, and environmental issues. “Those forecasts now seem hopelessly utopian,” the report says. “New conflicts have broken out in areas we were hardly aware of; world poverty continues to rise. There are two new nuclear powers. The UN’s reputation has been deeply dented by its inadequate response to a string of humanitarian crises. The mood is shifting from utopia to dystopia.”
Students of the Bible realize that man’s efforts, no matter how noble, can never fully succeed. Why not? Because, as the Bible states, “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) While under Satan’s control, the world cannot be brought to the Paradise condition for which God created it.
At the same time, there is basis for optimism. Jehovah God promises to bring about world peace, not by patching up this system of things, but by bringing about “a new earth” in which “righteousness is to dwell.” (2 Peter 3:13) Yes, by means of God’s Kingdom, our globe will be transformed into a peaceful, happy home, where life and work will be a constant joy for all obedient mankind. Furthermore, God promises to “wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.” These promises are not based on the shaky predictions of men. Rather, they are based on the infallible Word of the Creator, who cannot lie.—Revelation 21:4; Titus 1:2.

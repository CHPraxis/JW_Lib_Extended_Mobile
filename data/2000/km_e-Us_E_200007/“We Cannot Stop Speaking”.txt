“We Cannot Stop Speaking”
1 Jesus Christ is closely monitoring the preaching work. (Matt. 28:20; Mark 13:10) Though there are nearly six million active proclaimers bearing witness in 234 lands, we must not presume that our witnessing is finished. Until God declares that the work is done, “we cannot stop speaking” about the things we have learned.​—Acts 4:20.
2 Rely on God’s Spirit: Satan applies great pressure to discourage us. (Rev. 12:17) Our own imperfect flesh also plagues us with many problems. Such things can divert our attention from the all-important preaching work. Nevertheless, if we trust in Jehovah, his spirit will help us face any obstacle.
3 When the first-century Christian congregation was severely persecuted, the brothers prayed to God for help to keep speaking his word with all boldness. Jehovah answered their prayer, infusing them with his spirit and giving them the zeal and determination needed to keep on preaching. As a result, they continued without letup boldly declaring the good news.​—Acts 4:29, 31; 5:42.
4 Do Not Fear Negative Talk: General opinion or slanderous publicity may tend to have an intimidating effect upon us. However, remember the bold statement of Peter and the other apostles to the Sanhedrin, recorded at Acts 5:29-32. As the Law teacher Gamaliel admitted, God’s work cannot be overthrown. It is not accomplished by our power. This great work has God’s backing, and only he can accomplish it!​—Zech. 4:6.
5 Let us daily beseech Jehovah for his spirit to help us zealously proclaim the good news. May we say, as Jeremiah did, that the Kingdom message is like a burning fire in our bones. (Jer. 20:9) We cannot be silent!

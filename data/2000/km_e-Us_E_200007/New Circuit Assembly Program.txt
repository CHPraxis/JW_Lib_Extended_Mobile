New Circuit Assembly Program
We know that Jehovah God is worthy of our love and our exclusive devotion. However, the world seeks to entice us away from maintaining our close relationship with him. (John 17:14) To reinforce our love for Jehovah and to strengthen us to resist the things of the world that endanger our spirituality, the new circuit assembly program for the 2001 service year will have as its theme “Love God​—Not the Things of the World.”​—1 John 2:15-17.
Deep love for Jehovah impels us to give a witness about him. Even so, the field service is not easy for many of God’s people. In the part “Love for God Motivates Us in Our Ministry,” learn how many have overcome shyness and other obstacles in order to share fully in this work.
How do the deteriorating standards of the world influence us? Actions once considered wicked are now so-called normal behavior. The talk “Lovers of Jehovah Hate What Is Bad” and the symposium “Things in the World​—How Do We View Them?” will bolster our determination to say no to wrong desires.
A model Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting will be included in the program, as well as a summary of the Watchtower study article for the week. The public address, “How Love and Faith Conquer the World,” will encourage us to imitate Jesus in resisting worldly pressures. (John 16:33) Be sure to invite your Bible students to attend. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements can be made.
This circuit assembly will focus our attention on exactly where our love should be centered so as to enjoy Jehovah’s rich blessings. Do not miss any of it!

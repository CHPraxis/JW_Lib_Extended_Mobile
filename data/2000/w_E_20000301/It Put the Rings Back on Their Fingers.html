<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LOOK at my fingers. Do you see anything different?” A man held out his hand to a woman, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who looked at it and immediately noticed that his wedding ring was gone. He explained that he and his wife could no longer get along, so they decided to get a divorce. “No!” the Witness said. “Take this book and read it. It will help you with your marriage.” With that, she gave him a copy of the Bible-based book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some days later the man returned to the Witness in a happy mood. He showed her his hand. This time he was wearing his wedding ring. He told her that he and his wife had read the <em>Knowledge </em>book and that they now were very happy. The book had literally put the rings back on their fingers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible’s counsel can help a husband and wife to show genuine love for each other. This is so because the Bible’s author is none other than our Creator, who says: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>

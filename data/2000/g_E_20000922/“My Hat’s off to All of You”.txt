“My Hat’s off to All of You”
THAT is what a devout Catholic from Fairhope, Alabama, U.S.A., wrote regarding the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses and those who have taken it to him.
“The Watchtower and Awake! magazines are excellent in writing and story content,” he said. “I am always happy when some of your people come to bring me a copy of each. And I do read both of them.
“Your people are so nice and mannerly, and I feel so good seeing people doing God’s (Jehovah’s) work with a smile. This last time, two little kids came to my door and introduced themselves and offered me the magazines. I thanked them and felt so good seeing young kids doing good works instead of being troublemakers.
“I am a devoted Catholic . . . , but I can admire the great work your organization and its people are doing. From the bottom of my heart, I say that I really enjoy your magazines and admire your wonderful, smiling people. . . . My hat’s off to all of you. Keep up the good work.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses also provide publications to fill specific needs. One is the 32-page brochure entitled What Does God Require of Us? In 16 lessons it identifies both the fundamental teachings of the Bible and what the Bible says we need to do to receive God’s approval. If you would like to request a free copy, fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

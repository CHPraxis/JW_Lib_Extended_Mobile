<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is what a devout Catholic from Fairhope, Alabama, U.S.A., wrote regarding the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses and those who have taken it to him.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are excellent in writing and story content,” he said. “I am always happy when some of your people come to bring me a copy of each. And I do read both of them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Your people are so nice and mannerly, and I feel so good seeing people doing God’s (Jehovah’s) work with a smile. This last time, two little kids came to my door and introduced themselves and offered me the magazines. I thanked them and felt so good seeing young kids doing good works instead of being troublemakers.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I am a devoted Catholic . . . , but I can admire the great work your organization and its people are doing. From the bottom of my heart, I say that I really enjoy your magazines and admire your wonderful, smiling people. . . . My hat’s off to all of you. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses also provide publications to fill specific needs. One is the 32-page brochure entitled <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>In 16 lessons it identifies both the fundamental teachings of the Bible and what the Bible says we need to do to receive God’s approval. If you would like to request a free copy, fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

Raising Well-Adjusted Children—How?
“Children learn self-respect and self-control by receiving both love and discipline from parents,” says a report in The Gazette, a Montreal, Canada, newspaper. What does this involve? According to Montreal clinical psychologist Constance Lalinec, it is vital to set clear limits on child behavior.
Lalinec, who works with children and families, also notes that “when we prevent children from experiencing the consequences of their actions, we also prevent much of their learning.” Permissiveness can adversely affect a child’s development.
Time-tested wise advice on child rearing from the Bible is most fitting. It says: “Let your word Yes mean Yes, your No, No.” (Matthew 5:37) Once reasonable rules have been established and your children understand them, enforce them promptly and consistently. Support your words with effective action. This sends a clear message to children about parental rules and expectations—that people ‘will reap what they sow.’ (Galatians 6:7; Romans 2:6) The desired objective of loving and effective discipline is for children to learn to comply with rules and to tolerate frustration and delayed gratification so that they can develop qualities that they need in order to grow into well-adjusted, responsible adults.

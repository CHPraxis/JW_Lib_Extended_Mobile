<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How encouraging to see the 1988 service year come to a close with such an excellent report! The regular pioneers totaled 55,890, which is 2,747 more than August of last year. This also gladdens our hearts. Our determination is to laud Jehovah for his loving-kindness in prospering our efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:57:9-19:57:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 57:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I am an avid reader of your informative journal. However, in the November 22, 1987, copy it contained an article about a person who turned from a life of drug abuse to that of a God-fearing live-happily-ever-after type (“I Sought a Simpler Life Through Drugs”). It’s my understanding that persons involved in drug and/​or alcohol abuse experience (1) symptoms of withdrawal, (2) long-range recovery with proper treatment; [it is] also considered a family disease because the whole family is affected. None of these issues were discussed in that article.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Of course, one person’s experience does not cover all facets of the drug problem. Issues mentioned by our reader have been considered in earlier articles, such as: “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Recover From Drug Abuse?” </em>(<em>July 8, 1986</em>) <em>and “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Break Free From Drugs?” </em>(<em>September 22, 1985</em>)<em>.​—ED.</em></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I would like to express our [National SIDS Foundation] appreciation for the excellent, accurate and extensive coverage which you produced about ‘Sudden Infant Death Syndrome’ in your January 22, 1988, issue of <em>Awake! </em>The numbers which your publication reaches is astounding and certainly enhances our efforts at public education . . . I am wondering if you could send me copies of the January 22nd issue in Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian and Russian.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">On January 18, 1988, my husband and I were faced with the death of our beautiful three-and-a-half-month-old daughter from sudden infant death syndrome. Imagine our disbelief that this actually happened to us right at the time <em>Awake! </em>(January 22, 1988) printed an article about it! Even though such a terrible tragedy occurred, it has drawn all of us closer together, and so many friends told us they went back and <em>reread </em>that article about SIDS so that they would know what to do for us and say to us. Meals were prepared; they did cleaning, yard work, and tree trimming; generous contributions were given to help us cover expenses, and so forth. Please continue with those timely articles.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In the January 22 <em>Awake!</em>, page 4, paragraph 2, it says that the baby [in a case before King Solomon] who died was only three days old. I’m not sure that’s correct. It seems to me that the Bible (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:18-11:3:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:18, 19</a>) says that the babies were born three days apart and that at some unspecified time “later,” the one baby died.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>You are correct. The conclusion that the child was three days old was reached by the pathologist quoted in “Awake!” and was inadvertently included in the material.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">I am 12 years old and would like to thank you very much for the article in <em>Awake! </em>of December 8, 1987, “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Face My Grief?” Just six weeks earlier I had lost my little brother, who was stillborn. Although I never got to know him, it still hurt as much as if I had lost my eight-year-old sister. The article helped me understand that crying is normal and not a sign of weak faith.</p>

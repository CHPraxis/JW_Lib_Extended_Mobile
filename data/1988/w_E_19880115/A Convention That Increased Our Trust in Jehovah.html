<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span><strong>A Convention That Increased Our Trust in Jehovah</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">OUR heavenly Father, Jehovah God, knows just what we need. And he puts it in the minds of his dedicated servants who are directing his work on the earth to satisfy that need. This can certainly be said of the “Trust in Jehovah” District Conventions, held around the earth from June 1987 onward. They truly served to fortify Christians against the skepticism, doubt, and mistrust so prevalent in the world.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The theme “Trust in Jehovah” was masterfully woven into the program. It was highlighted by statements that were strong and pointed, that were marked with candor and forthrightness. All of this reinforced the listeners’ trust in Jehovah. They could go home with the theme indelibly impressed upon their hearts and minds, determined that by their actions and their words they would proclaim to all that they fully trust in Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong><em>“Trust in Jehovah, You People”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Those words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:4-23:26:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:4</a> expressed the theme for the first day. Most fittingly, the program opened with the talk “Incline Your Ear to God’s Sayings.” The speaker showed that this expression, which occurs many times in God’s Word, means to give full attention with both mind and heart to what is said, with the intention of applying what is heard. That means exercising self-control and concentrating on what is said, not letting the <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>mind wander. Only by thus inclining our ear will our trust in Jehovah be strengthened by what we hear and then we will be motivated to act on what is said. And should this not be our attitude whenever we hear God’s Word expounded, as at our congregation meetings?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The convention chairman presented the next subject, “Those Trusting in Jehovah Are Happy to Be Here.” He pointed out that the greater our trust in Jehovah, the greater our happiness. To trust in Jehovah means to rest absolutely and assuredly upon him. The greater our knowledge of Jehovah and our affection for him, the stronger will be our trust in him. The convention theme was no mere slogan. We manifest our trust in Jehovah in many ways, not the least of which is showing consideration for others. To the delight of all, at the conclusion of his remarks, the chairman presented the first release​—a colorful, practical witnessing instrument. It was the tract <em>Why You Can Trust the Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After discussing the notable example of David when facing the giant Goliath, the next speaker featured “How Some Have Trusted in Jehovah” in modern times. For instance, there was a sister whose unbelieving husband, with gun in hand, threatened to kill her if she kept going to meetings. Others have demonstrated their trust in Jehovah when told that their life depended on accepting a blood transfusion. Youths have given proof of their trust in Jehovah by resisting pressures to go in for sports or to opt for higher education after completing high school.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Friday morning program concluded with the talk “A People Set Apart From the World.” We show that we trust in Jehovah by keeping our conduct with the opposite sex above reproach, by letting Christian principles govern our recreation, and by avoiding all dress and grooming that would tend to blur the distinction between the sexes. By our thus being set apart from the world, time and again a powerful witness is given, <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>even resulting in some coming into the truth.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">On Friday afternoon, the program began with the talk “Pioneering Speeds Up Spiritual Growth.” And how true that is! Through Jehovah’s Word, his holy spirit, and his organization, God provides what we need to progress to “a full-grown man,” but pioneering puts us in a position to make better and more thorough use of all these spiritual provisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:13-49:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:13</a>) By means of interviews, pioneers told how the full-time ministry enabled them to cultivate more fully the fruitage of God’s spirit, to express more love for people, to be more efficient in the ministry, and to trust Jehovah to a greater extent, thus fostering a closer relationship with him. All of this has speeded up their spiritual growth.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Next came the keynote speech, “A People Trusting Always in Jehovah.” This stirring discourse showed that we are different from the world because we completely trust in Jehovah. Based on various texts from the book of Isaiah, the speaker showed how we have seen these very encouraging prophecies fulfilled in Jehovah’s Witnesses because we trust in God. With confidence, we look forward to the time in the near future when Jehovah will express his indignation toward all nations and then usher in Paradise.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The conventioners were encouraged to “Spread the Good News at Every Opportunity.” After the importance of doing that was stressed, a number of demonstrations showed how the new tract <em>Why You Can Trust the Bible </em>can be used effectively in both formal and informal witnessing. Surely, we always want to have these tracts with us, for spreading the good news at every opportunity should be characteristic of every witness of Jehovah and is a way to show that we trust in Him.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Very much appreciated was the talk “Parents​—Reach Your Child’s Heart From Infancy.” For a child to grow up trusting in Jehovah, his training must begin in infancy and must receive priority. <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>Only then will it be possible to negate all the bad influences of television, school, and the street. ‘Let your child see in you what you want him to be,’ parents were told. Yes, setting a fine example is the best way to reach a child’s heart. All aspects of sacred service must come naturally and be happifying if the atmosphere of the home is to be truly spiritual. We never want to begrudge the time and effort involved. Keep reaching the child’s heart also by good communication. Exercise firmness with love, and appeal to reason when giving discipline. Give praise and reward when deserved, but never bribe your child.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Coming to grips with a serious problem among some young Witnesses was the talk “Youths​—Guard Against Leading a Double Life.” Why do some try to lead a double life? Because they want the approval of their parents and the congregation and yet fear the ridicule of their worldly peers. Or they feel that they are missing out on some pleasure if they do not smoke, take drugs, or share in illicit sex. But there simply is no escaping the fact that all such leading of a double life brings reproach upon Jehovah, grief to one’s parents, and misery to oneself. Anyone sowing to the flesh reaps corruption, whereas maintaining a good relationship with Jehovah, fully trusting in him, guards one from leading a double life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:8-48:6:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Powerfully underscoring all these principles was the drama that immediately followed. Entitled <em>Loyal Submission to Jehovah and His Organization, </em>it contained much food for thought as it portrayed how an elder felt compelled to step down because his daughter was exposed as one leading a double life. The drama elicited many enthusiastic expressions of appreciation.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong><em>“Trust in Jehovah and Do Good”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:3-19:37:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:3</a>, this was the theme of the convention’s second day. After a consideration of the day’s text, which included encouragement to do this daily, the program featured a three-part symposium entitled “Manifesting Our Trust in Jehovah.” The first speaker showed the need to do this “By Diligently Studying God’s Word.” This we must do to avoid the trap of complacency and the snares of materialism, sexual immorality, and apostasy. The Society has provided an abundance of Bible study aids, such as the new <em>Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985. </em>Only by taking full advantage of these provisions can we have a good, trusting relationship with our heavenly Father and be effective as his witnesses.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The next speaker stressed the fact that trust in Jehovah is manifested “By Practicing the Things Learned.” Yes, we want to be doers of the Word, always concerned with making progress. In what areas? Why, in our relationship with others, in our dress and grooming, in seeking first God’s Kingdom, and in promoting peace and unity among our brothers! To avoid the sin of presumptuousness, we must be careful to keep our place in the family and the congregation. If we thus apply the things we learn, it will be evident to all that we trust in Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The symposium concluded with a discussion of the subject “Manifesting Our Trust in Jehovah​—By Exerting Ourselves in the Field.” By doing this, we show our love for God and our neighbor and protect ourselves. We may be satisfied with lukewarm, token service, but is Jehovah? Does not his Son urge us to exert ourselves vigorously? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:24-42:13:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 13:24</a>) The increases we keep seeing in publishers, pioneers, and average hours spent in the field ministry <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>should stimulate us to try to do more personally. Is that not so? By such zealous activity, we will set a fine example, demonstrate our trust in Jehovah, and win his smile of approval.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Next came an appeal to our conscience in the talk “Practice Giving in Full Measure.” How bountifully Jehovah provides for us spiritually and materially! We show our appreciation by imitating him both by witnessing and by contributing financially toward the preaching work. Could we cut down on costly pleasures so as to give in fuller measure?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The baptism talk, “Your Dedication and Baptism Reflect Trust in Jehovah,” showed why we trust in God and not in men. Water baptism denotes dying to our former course of conduct and being raised to a way of life that harmonizes with the divine will. Thereafter, we must continue ‘to exercise justice, love kindness, and be modest in walking with our God.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>) Among those getting baptized were an 8-year-old girl who conducts two Bible studies with schoolmates, a 79-year-old man, and a 44-year-old quadriplegic.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Saturday afternoon’s program began with the talk “Doing the ‘Necessary Things’ to Please God.” Based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>, it showed the need to acquaint our doctors with our stand on blood before a medical crisis occurs and gave fine suggestions as to how to do this.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">A talk that prompted much favorable comment was “Responsible Childbearing in This Time of the End.” It presented a balanced view, showing that while childbearing can bring many joys, it also brings many responsibilities and often results in heartaches, such as when children go wrong. Especially are mothers likely to suffer spiritually because of the burdens of childbearing.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Then came the talk “Elders​—Guard Your Trust.” This trust is to shepherd God’s flock​—leading, feeding, and protecting it, in keeping with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a>. Doing justice to family obligations while caring for congregational duties represents a real challenge. For elders to guard their trust also means avoiding the snares of materialism, excessive recreation, and illicit pleasures. Among those interviewed at the Dortmund district convention in the Federal Republic of Germany was an elder who has been guarding his trust for 60 years.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The talk “Be Obedient to Those Taking the Lead” logically came next. Love will help us to be submissive and obedient to congregation overseers and will keep us from becoming impatient because they are not perfect, for neither are we. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:17</a>) By showing respect for the elders in matters large and small, we help them to bear their burdens instead of adding to them.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Saturday’s program came to a close with the three-part symposium “The Word of God Is Alive,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>. The first speaker showed that it is alive because “It Exerts Transforming Power.” Today, even as in Bible times, we have many examples showing how trust in God’s Word has caused people to make great changes in their lives and has empowered them to preach fearlessly.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>Part two of this symposium on God’s Word showed that “It Is Sharper Than Any Two-Edged Sword.” It enables us to slash Babylonish false teachings to pieces. It also helps us to ‘divide between soul and spirit’ in that it enables us to distinguish between our actions and our real motives. By using the “sword” in this way, we will be more pleasing to Jehovah God and more at peace with others and ourselves.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The concluding part showed that God’s Word is alive because “It Fortifies and Motivates Our Heart.” In the Bible, the word “heart” is generally used figuratively and refers to the inner person manifested in our mental and emotional qualities. God’s Word fortifies our heart by revealing his marvelous qualities through his dealings with mankind. God’s unselfish love motivates us to imitate him. In his concluding remarks, the speaker reviewed the Watch Tower Society’s record in publishing Bibles and thrilled the audience by announcing the release of a beautiful deluxe pocket edition of the <em>New World Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>“Trust in Jehovah With All Your Heart”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This theme for Sunday, taken from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5</a>, was considered by an elder who opened the program and discussed the day’s text. Then came the soul-searching talk “Do You Take Sacred Things for Granted?” The world feels that it owes nothing to God, but as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we know that to have his approval, we must imitate the faithful men of old by showing appreciation for sacred things. The speaker discussed 13 of these, among which are Jehovah’s name, his Word, his holy spirit, his laws, his visible organization, our relationship with God, our meetings, and our privileges of service. If we truly appreciate these sacred things, we will put them first in our lives, trust in Jehovah fully, and be rewarded by him.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Next came the hard-hitting talk “Detest Utterly the World’s Disgraceful Course.” Because of its forthrightness, it elicited remarks such as, “Just what we needed!” Since wickedness has become commonplace, Christians must guard against condoning immorality and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) Therefore, we should not watch or listen to such broadcasts on TV or the radio, nor should we read about them in periodicals. Indeed, we do not even want to be <em>thinking </em>about them. ‘Genuine Christians who wish to maintain a good relationship with Jehovah simply cannot have anything to do with pornography,’ no, not even a little!</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Sunday morning’s program concluded with the gripping Bible drama <em>Jehovah Delivers Those Calling Upon His Name. </em>It dealt with several events in the life of Joshua. Realistically, it portrayed how Jericho’s residents must have viewed the marching of Israel’s men of war around the city day after day. Also highlighted was Rahab’s great faith, which resulted in deliverance for her and her household. In conclusion, all were asked: ‘Do you have the solid faith and confidence of Joshua and his valiant associates? If so, we can hope to share in Jehovah’s final victory over his enemies.’</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The public feature of the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention came with the talk entitled “In Our Fearful Times, Whom Can You Really Trust?” It made evident the fact that mankind desperately needs a source of trust! Clearly, it showed the folly of trusting in humans. Hence, God’s Word counsels us to trust in Jehovah and gives us strong reasons for doing so. We should trust in him because of his qualities and his record in delivering those who have trusted in him, King Hezekiah being a striking example. Soon a similar deliverance will be <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>experienced by those whose course of action demonstrates trust in Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">“Continue ‘to Live Peaceably’” was the theme of the talk that immediately followed. To live peaceably means to be actively promoting peace. It also means being at peace with ourselves because of holding a good conscience. By manifesting the fruits of God’s spirit, especially love and self-control, we will be able to live peaceably with our own families and with the brothers and sisters in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">There is no question about the fact that this convention equipped all of us for “Facing the Future With Full Trust in Jehovah,” the subject of the concluding talk. How well it summed up the program! The speaker stressed that daily we need to trust in Jehovah with all our heart, take note of him in all our ways, and let him direct our paths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) Conventioners greatly appreciated hearing about the 16 new public talks, <em>The Watchtower </em>cassettes, and a reprint of an article on blood that appeared in <em>Awake! </em>and that will be available for us to give to our doctors. Yes, and we were thrilled to learn about the release of another Bible drama on cassette, the reprinting of <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes (1960-79), and the publication of three more tracts!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">All present for the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention were greatly upbuilt spiritually. They are now ready to face the future with full confidence in their heavenly Father. And all were fittingly encouraged by the concluding exhortation: “As we face the future, may we all unitedly prove by our way of life that we ‘trust in Jehovah.’”</p>

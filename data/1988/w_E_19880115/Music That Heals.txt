Music That Heals
A young mother from Iowa, U.S.A., explains: “I have to write to tell you just how much your [piano] tapes ‘Sing Praises to Jehovah’ mean to me and my family. Every day, I rock my three-year-old to sleep. But first we put in one of the tapes, and then I get out my songbook and sing along as she’s going to sleep.”
This mother goes on to describe the premature birth of her latest child and his ordeal in a respirator, where he had to have a tube down his throat. She relates: “I asked the nurses if we could bring a tape player and some music tapes for him. They said we could. The nurses couldn’t believe how the tapes helped him to relax. They made the comment that every time he would get fussy, all they would have to do was play his music for him. One nurse even said: ‘I wish we had this kind of music for all the babies. It’s so beautiful. All these babies hear is the beeping of their monitors.’”
Indeed, many have found this music healing to their soul. The beautiful album entitled “Sing Praises to Jehovah,” containing eight cassettes, is available for only $15. You can receive your album by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with your payment.
Please send, postpaid, the album “Sing Praises to Jehovah” with the eight cassette music tapes. I enclose $15 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

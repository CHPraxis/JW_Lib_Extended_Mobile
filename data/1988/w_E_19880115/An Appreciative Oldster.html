<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 79-year-old woman from Japan was moved to write the following letter after reading the June 1, 1987, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>on the theme “Who Will Care for the Elderly?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">To the Brothers Whom I Esteem,</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Upon studying the June 1, 1987, issue regarding the elderly, I find the material most understanding and kind. When I reached paragraph 11, I had to get my handkerchief because I just cried and cried and could not stop. Those were tears of deep gratitude. What love and kindness! I could only do what <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:1-19:150:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 150</a> says​—praise Jah! I humbly offer my deepest gratitude to you brothers for publishing these thoughtful articles on showing kindness to elderly people, down to the finest details. Of course, I am grateful for the fine articles you publish each month, and there are no words to express my appreciation adequately. Again, I thank you.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Happily, everyone in our congregation is so loving and kind. They take me to and from the preaching territory in their cars, and because of their kind service, I am an auxiliary pioneer. I am deeply grateful for each and every day that I can live in such a wonderful and protective organization.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the world today, where old people are becoming more numerous but less welcome, there is nothing more precious than the blessings we receive from such a loving God. It is my prayer that I can help as many people as possible to learn the truth so that they can rejoice together with us.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Praise to Jehovah and thanks to you, my dear brothers. Please excuse my terrible handwriting, which I am ashamed of. May Jehovah bless you and grant you good health.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Words and sentiments like these confirm the fact that true Christian love knows no boundary or age limit. Jehovah’s Witnesses, young and old, demonstrate their discipleship by living up to Jesus’ statement: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>.</p>

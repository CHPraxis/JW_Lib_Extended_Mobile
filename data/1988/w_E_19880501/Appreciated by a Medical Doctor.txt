Appreciated by a Medical Doctor
A medical doctor in Frankfurt, West Germany, who had been invited to renew his subscriptions for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, not only sent the money for the renewals but explained:
“I am constantly amazed to find such a wide offering of really good and very interesting articles​—many of them outside the realm of religion—​at such a low price. Though I have little time for myself, my evenings were often spent curled up in my living room reading your magazines by lamplight. Again, a warm thank you for your efforts.”
Why not enjoy this excellent reading material yourself? You can have these two valuable journals delivered to your home by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

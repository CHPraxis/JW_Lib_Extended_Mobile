<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A medical doctor in Frankfurt, West Germany, who had been invited to renew his subscriptions for the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines, not only sent the money for the renewals but explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am constantly amazed to find such a wide offering of really good and very interesting articles​—many of them outside the realm of religion—​at such a low price. Though I have little time for myself, my evenings were often spent curled up in my living room reading your magazines by lamplight. Again, a warm thank you for your efforts.”</p>

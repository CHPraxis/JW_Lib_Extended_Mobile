<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a young person from Puerto Rico says is found in the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>He writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Not too long ago I wrote to you concerning a problem I had, masturbation, and asked that you favor me with some advice by means of presenting some information in your magazine. Well, a friend of mine, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, gave me the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>to read. This happened about a month ago. I would like to let you know that since I read chapter 5 of this book, I have not practiced this habit again. I have come to realize that masturbation isn’t really something one needs. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I would like it if every young person would read this book regardless of his religious affiliation. All young people have the same problems, and this book is like a treasure, for it has the solution to all our problems. . . . You should continue publishing books for youths because in a world filled with drugs and immorality, this book is like a glass of very cool, refreshing water.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Besides discussing masturbation and homosexuality, this book covers the use of drugs and alcohol, sports, music, dancing, dating, courtship, and many other matters that affect youths.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Leaves high up in a tree need water and nutrients, often thousands of gallons a day. These must be pumped up, but how?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“This incredible pumping feat starts deep down in the earth where millions of microscopic root hairs absorb water and dissolved minerals,” explains <em>Compressed Air Magazine. </em>“As water is consumed, a shortage is created in the leaves that causes the columns to move upward and literally pull more water from the soil. No man-made vacuum pump can pull water beyond about 32 feet <strong>[10 m]</strong>.” But what about the pumping system of a tree?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is so remarkable that it is said it could, if necessary, lift water in a tree about two miles <strong>[3 km] </strong>high! No wonder that an advertisement by a prominent manufacturer of pumps draws attention to the maple tree’s “remarkable pump” and acknowledges: “We can’t equal nature in patience or performance.”</p>

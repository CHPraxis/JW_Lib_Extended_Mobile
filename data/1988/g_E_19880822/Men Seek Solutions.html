<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE MAD [Mutual Assured Destruction] doctrine is immoral. There is something macabre, and worse, in basing our security on our ability to murder Russian women and children. And it is even more reprehensible​—if that’s possible—​to deliberately increase the exposure of our own people to nuclear destruction simply in order to fulfill the demands of an abstract, a historical, unproven and illogical theory.” These words, spoken by U.S. Senator William Armstrong, reflect the uneasiness many Americans feel about a defense based on the ability to retaliate.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As an alternative, in March 1983, U.S. President Reagan proposed the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), more popularly known as Star Wars. He said: “I call upon <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>the scientific community who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents to the cause of mankind and world peace: to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Reagan envisioned the development of exotic, high-tech weapons​—X-ray lasers, electromagnetic rail-guns, kinetic-kill vehicles, neutral-particle-beam weapons—​that would defend America and its allies by zapping enemy missiles before they could reach their targets.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">SDI, however, has been fiercely and widely debated from the outset. Opponents claim that it is technologically impossible to create a leakproof “umbrella” against a determined attack​—and a leaky “umbrella” is useless against nuclear weapons. Summing up other objections, a U.S. congressman said cynically that “other than the fact that the SDI system can be underflown, overwhelmed, outfoxed, cannot be run by humans but only by computers, would breach a number of arms control treaties and could trigger a thermal nuclear war, . . . it is not a bad system.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Soviet Union also strongly objects to SDI. They say that America simply wants to build a shield in order to wield the sword. U.S. officials, in turn, accuse the Soviets of secretly developing their own strategic defense system.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At any rate, SDI would prove extremely expensive to develop and deploy. Estimates range from 126 billion to 1.3 <em>trillion </em>U.S. dollars. By comparison, the entire U.S. Interstate Highway System cost $123 billion! Nevertheless, billions of dollars have already been allocated by the U.S. Congress to SDI research.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong><em>Prospect of Disarmament</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Says the Soviet Ministry of Defense: “The Soviet people are convinced that nuclear disarmament is the most reliable guarantee that nuclear catastrophe will be prevented.” Lofty ideals notwithstanding, the arms race continues at full speed.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The fundamental obstacle to disarmament? Lack of trust. <em>Soviet Military Power 1987, </em>a U.S. Department of Defense publication, accuses the Soviet Union of ‘seeking world domination.’ <em>Whence the Threat to Peace, </em>published by the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Defense, speaks of the U.S. “imperial ambition to ‘rule the world.’”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Even when arms-control talks are <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>convened, both sides accuse the other of having selfish motives. The above-quoted Soviet publication thus accuses the United States of “blocking progress toward disarmament in all areas” in an effort to “conduct international affairs from the position of strength.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The United States counters that arms control is merely a Soviet scheme to lock in “existing military advantages. . . . Moreover, [Moscow] sees arms control negotiations as a way of furthering Soviet military objectives and undermining public support for Western defense policies and programs.”​<em>—Soviet Military Power 1987.</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The recent agreement to eliminate intermediate range missiles seems a giant step forward. It is the first agreement ever actually to reduce​—not simply limit—​nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, such a treaty, historic though it is, falls short of eliminating <em>all </em>nuclear weapons.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>The Verification Problem</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Suppose, though, that all the nuclear powers actually agreed to total disarmament. What would stop any or all nations from cheating​—failing to get rid of the banned weapons or secretly producing them?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Kenneth Adelman, former director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said: “Elimination of nuclear weapons would require the most extensive and intrusive system of onsite inspections anyone could imagine. . . . That would mean, in turn, unprecedented openness to foreign intrusion on the part of all nations.” It is difficult to imagine that any nation would adopt such an open-house policy.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">But let us further suppose that the nations somehow overcame all these formidable obstacles and disarmed. The technology and knowledge required to make the bomb would still exist. Should a conventional war break out, there would always be the possibility that it could escalate to the point where nuclear weapons would be recreated​—and used.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Hans Bethe, one of the physicists who worked to develop the first atom bomb, thus recently said: “We thought we could control the genie. It wouldn’t go back in the bottle, but there were reasonable grounds for thinking we could contain it. I know now that this was an illusion.”</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sc">Some argue that defending against a nuclear attack is superior to retaliating after an attack</p>

Stalled Mall
A recent cartoon in the Scranton Times, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, made a comment about the town’s long delay in completing plans for a shopping mall. One character says to the other: “Seems like it’s taking forever to get a start on the mall!” to which the other replies: “They should call it ‘the Downtown Mall Kingdom Hall!’ The Jehovah’s Witnesses will have it built in 3 days!”
In many countries Jehovah’s Witnesses are becoming widely known for their hundreds of quickly built Kingdom Halls. They have specially trained construction crews and good advance planning. As a result, Kingdom Halls are being built in from 30 hours to 4 days. And people are taking notice.

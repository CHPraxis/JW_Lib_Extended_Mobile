“The Drudgery Is Gone Forever!”
So commented one user of the Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985. She adds: “What a difference personal study is. . . . Can’t get over how much I can look up in just a short period of time.”
This new book has indexed publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society from 1930 to 1985. By using it, you can with ease find in your library of Watch Tower publications specific information on literally thousands of subjects, such as the following:
▪ the dos and don’ts of discipline in child training
▪ how to prepare for a job interview
▪ the role of DNA in cell replication
▪ what requests a prayer should not include
▪ the Bible’s view on abortion
▪ what God’s Kingdom will mean to us
Please send, postpaid, the Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985. I enclose $7 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

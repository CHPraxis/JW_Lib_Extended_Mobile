<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A recent cartoon in the <em>Scranton Times, </em>of Scranton, Pennsylvania, made a comment about the town’s long delay in completing plans for a shopping mall. One character says to the other: “Seems like it’s taking forever to get a start on the mall!” to which the other replies: “They should call it ‘the Downtown Mall Kingdom Hall!’ The Jehovah’s Witnesses will have it built in 3 days!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In many countries Jehovah’s Witnesses are becoming widely known for their hundreds of quickly built Kingdom Halls. They have specially trained construction crews and good advance planning. As a result, Kingdom Halls are being built in from 30 hours to 4 days. And people are taking notice.</p>

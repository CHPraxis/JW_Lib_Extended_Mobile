<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why acquire a personal library?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One fundamental reason is that personal study is important to Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) It is a convenience to have a library at home in order to do research, answer questions, and prepare for Christian meetings. We should not underestimate the value of having easy access to reliable Scriptural information.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another reason for having a home library is related to the fact that each Christian must “carry his own load” of responsibility. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) When questions arise, it is good to have the habit of first doing our own research and only then asking questions of others if necessary. We can develop our powers of discernment and understanding by being diligent students of God’s Word and making good use of a home library.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:11-58:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some children have been assisted by their parents to build their own personal library, having in mind both present and future needs. No doubt about it, a good personal library is a valuable possession in a Christian home.</p>

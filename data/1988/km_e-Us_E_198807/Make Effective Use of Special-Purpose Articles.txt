Make Effective Use of Special-Purpose Articles
1 Magazine distribution is increasing steadily. The 1979 production of 394,899,446 magazines leaped to 585,369,060 in 1987, nearly a 50-percent increase, or 190,469,614 more magazines printed in 1987 than in 1979! And over 1,135,585,000 copies of The Watchtower and Awake! were printed in the past two years.
2 With the use of full color, a dramatic improvement in appearance occurred in The Watchtower in January 1986 and in Awake! in January 1987. Have you appreciated this? Many have, and they have told us so. The question is, Can we make even more effective use of our magazines?
3 To help you do this, Our Kingdom Ministry will announce in advance special-purpose articles or articles that may be of special interest to a particular segment of the people in your territory. Suggestions on whom these might appeal to will be provided. If publishers desire extra copies, these should be ordered immediately.
4 For example, the September 8 Awake! features the subject “Parents​—You Have Homework Too!” The articles should appeal to every schoolteacher and school administrator because the articles emphasize the responsibilities of parents to cooperate with the school system in educating their young. Also, every parent can benefit from the information. So your congregation may want to order extra copies.
5 The October 8 Awake! will have a comprehensive coverage of the disease AIDS, which will be of real interest to many people, including those in the medical field. And the October 22 Awake! discusses the issue of divorce and child custody. You may want to leave a copy with every lawyer and family counselor in your territory.
6 Rush shipments of extra magazines should be avoided. This can be done if the service overseer anticipates the congregation’s needs and sends in orders without delay.

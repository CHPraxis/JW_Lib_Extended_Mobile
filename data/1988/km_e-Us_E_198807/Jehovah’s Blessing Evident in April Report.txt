Jehovah’s Blessing Evident in April Report
The April service report for the United States gives clear evidence of Jehovah’s abundant blessing as thousands more share in the harvest work.​—Matt. 9:37, 38.
Total Publishers: A new peak of 780,744 publishers was reached. This is 33,788 more than one year ago.
Auxiliary Pioneers: A new peak of 101,145 reported. This figure combined with the number serving as regular pioneers totals 158,156. This is the highest number ever to serve as pioneers during any one month.
Total Hours: 16,996,871. This new peak is 759,128 over our previous peak of hours in April 1987. How commendable that congregation publishers averaged 10.1 hours!
Home Bible Studies: 570,094. An increase of 17,056 over our peak in March of this year and a 3.8-percent increase over last April.
Jehovah is carrying out his promise to fill his spiritual house with glory by bringing in “the desirable things” of all the nations. (Hag. 2:7) May our joy increase and abound as we continue to experience Jehovah’s rich blessings upon our zealous activity in the harvest work.

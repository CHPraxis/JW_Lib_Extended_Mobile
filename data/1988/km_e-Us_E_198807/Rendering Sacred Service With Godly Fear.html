<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>During the 1988 service year, the Society has received many letters expressing heartfelt appreciation for the circuit assembly program “The Excelling Value of Serving Jehovah.” These letters have expressed sentiments similar to those of the psalmist who said: “A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:10-19:84:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 84:10</a>) We know that all of you have similar feelings about our grand privilege of serving Jehovah and that you too benefited from this program.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Starting in September, the new circuit assembly program will develop the theme “Rendering Sacred Service With Godly Fear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 12:28</a>) While the world foolishly ignores Jehovah and despises the message of his Kingdom, we delight in our privilege of rendering sacred service with godly fear. Truly, a wholesome fear of Jehovah is “the beginning of wisdom”; it is “pure,” motivating us to do his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:9-19:19:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 19:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 111:10</a>) The circuit assembly program for the 1989 service year will help us to appreciate more fully what the fear of Jehovah is and how we can manifest it in our service to him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As the program unfolds, we will learn how godly fear should affect us in our ministry, in our meeting attendance, and in our day-to-day living. The need to close any gap between what we know and what we do will be discussed. We must know not only what to do but also how to apply the things that we learn so as to benefit ourselves and others and to bring praise to our God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The public talk is entitled “Why Fear the True God?” Be sure to invite your Bible students as well as other interested persons. Surely, all of us want to arrange our affairs in order to attend and benefit fully from this splendid two-day program. Your circuit overseer will inform you of the location and the dates that are scheduled for your congregation.</p>

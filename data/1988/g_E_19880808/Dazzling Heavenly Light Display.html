<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The awe-inspiring northern lights (aurora borealis; in the Southern Hemisphere, the aurora australis) remain one of the mysteries of the skies. Various theories have been offered to explain their appearances.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Currently, the idea seems to be that the lights are seen “when charged particles from the sun strike the upper atmosphere near the magnetic poles.” Green or yellowish-green is the color most often seen, but red, shadings of orange, and even violet have been observed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Though the lights usually appear as undulating bands or ribbons of light, one dazzling display took the form of a giant celestial dome with arched lines radiating out from a central point directly above the observers and downward to the horizon all around them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This dazzling light display brings to mind the words of the psalmist when he declared:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sl">“How many your works are, O Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sl">All of them in wisdom you have made.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sl">The earth is full of your productions.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some lessons scheduled in the <em>Creation </em>book are short. When preparing for the Congregation Book Study, it may be helpful to look up related material published in recent years in <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Information that can be found through use of the <em>Index </em>should stimulate discussion of points mentioned briefly in the <em>Creation </em>book. For example, relevant material that may be considered during December can be found by checking references listed under “Creation,” “Evolution,” “Earth,” “Seasons,” “Water,” “Atmosphere,” “Trees,” and so forth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With a little research, study conductors in particular can be better prepared to stimulate discussion when time allows. Answers should be clear and to the point.</p>

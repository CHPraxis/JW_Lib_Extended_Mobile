<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Since 1943 the Theocratic Ministry School has proved to be a real blessing to those who have taken advantage of its fine provisions. Yes, the Theocratic Ministry School continues to accomplish its two main objectives: (1) to improve our ability to speak Bible truth and (2) to make us more familiar with God’s Word, its doctrines, and its principles. Many have expressed deep appreciation for the benefits received from the progressive training of the Theocratic Ministry School. Both brothers and sisters have been helped to ‘handle the word of truth aright.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>MAKING ADVANCEMENT</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Those who are newly enrolled as well as those who have been in the school for many years can gain the greatest benefit by carefully preparing their assignments. It has been observed that some read their presentation. To become more proficient in giving a witness requires both good reading and the ability to express oneself extemporaneously.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The <em>Reasoning </em>book has proved to be a fine asset in our work, and the Theocratic Ministry School is an excellent forum through which we have become better acquainted with its many features. Becoming more familiar with this publication will enable us to express ideas in our own words and to be more conversational. During 1989 we will continue to benefit from a progressive consideration of the <em>Reasoning </em>book by means of the student talks based on material in that publication.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR 1989</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>During the coming year, Assignment No. 1 will still be based on <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </em>Although 15 minutes will be allotted, a slight adjustment is being made. From 10 to 12 minutes may be used for the talk and from 3 to 5 minutes for the oral review.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Highlights from the Bible reading will continue to be one of the most important parts of the Theocratic Ministry School. Brothers who handle this assignment should help the audience understand <em>why </em>and <em>how </em>the information is of value to us. Using the Scripture index in the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>can be of much assistance. Additionally, special articles on books of the Hebrew Scriptures will continue to appear in <em>The Watchtower, </em>and these will provide background material and other practical points that can be used. If the weekly presentation of Bible highlights is not properly cared for, the school overseer will give private counsel.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WRITTEN REVIEWS</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Beginning in 1989, a change will be made in the way in which written reviews are handled. Reviews will be held three times during the year​—at the end of April, August, and December. The Society will no longer provide a printed review sheet, but each publisher should bring his own paper and pen so he may participate. As in the past, prepared questions with their answers will be provided by the Society. In the written reviews, particular attention will be given to material covered in Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE READING</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Are we personally benefiting from the assigned Bible reading? As we read, let us look for scriptures that build appreciation, that strengthen qualities needed in our personal and family life, or that help us apply the examples in the narratives. Have we tried doing our weekly Bible reading while listening to the Society’s Bible tapes? By thus utilizing the senses of seeing and hearing we can greatly enhance our grasp of the material. Let us not overlook the excellent help these tapes provide for brothers assigned to prepare Talk No. 2. By paying attention to proper pronunciation, voice inflection, sense stress, and modulation, these can make their reading more lively and meaningful.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah has made abundant spiritual provision to assist us in our vital preaching work. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:14-19:19:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 19:14</a>, David expressed his prayerful desire: “Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.” If, as in David’s case, love for Jehovah and his Son wells up in our heart, the Theocratic Ministry School can help us make the sayings of our mouth more pleasurable to Jehovah during 1989. Let us determine now to benefit fully from this loving provision of our kind heavenly Father.</p>

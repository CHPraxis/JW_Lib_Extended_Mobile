<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Congregations should begin ordering bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 1988 on their December literature orders. (See the 1988 <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 7-10.) The bound volumes will be available in Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Back Ordered” on congregation invoices. Bound volumes are controlled stock items and will be charged at $6.00 each for congregation, public, and pioneers. (See the <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 23-25.)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Shipment of the reprinted <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes for 1960 through 1964 has begun, and the Society will now accept orders for the years 1965 through 1969. Congregations and individuals desiring to have these volumes for their library should determine the total number of volumes they need for each year and submit their requests through the congregation. The total quantities should be entered on the Literature Order form (S-14) and SUBMITTED DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1988. (See the <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 7-10.) Printing of the 1965 through 1969 bound volumes, for the English <em>Watchtower </em>only, will commence in early 1989. Please do not place orders for years other than 1965 through 1969 until future direction appears in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Since the Society will not stock these reprinted volumes, we urge all to consider the matter carefully and place orders for the 1965 through 1969 volumes that are needed. Later orders will only be filled as long as existing supplies last. These reprinted volumes are controlled stock items and are to be paid for upon receipt. The price will be $6.00 each.</p>

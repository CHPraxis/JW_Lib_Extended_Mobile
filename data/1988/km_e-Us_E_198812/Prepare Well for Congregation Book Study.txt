Prepare Well for Congregation Book Study
Some lessons scheduled in the Creation book are short. When preparing for the Congregation Book Study, it may be helpful to look up related material published in recent years in The Watchtower and Awake!
Information that can be found through use of the Index should stimulate discussion of points mentioned briefly in the Creation book. For example, relevant material that may be considered during December can be found by checking references listed under “Creation,” “Evolution,” “Earth,” “Seasons,” “Water,” “Atmosphere,” “Trees,” and so forth.
With a little research, study conductors in particular can be better prepared to stimulate discussion when time allows. Answers should be clear and to the point.

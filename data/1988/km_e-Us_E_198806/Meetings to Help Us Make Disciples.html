<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will not outline a Service Meeting for the week starting July 18, thus allowing an open week for attending the “Divine Justice” District Convention. The Service Meeting for the week starting July 25 will be outlined to allow 10 minutes for local announcements and 35 minutes for a review of the convention program highlights. Those congregations having earlier conventions will adjust their schedules and fit in the outlined Service Meetings accordingly. In this way all the material in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>for June and July will be covered. Publishers should bring the appropriate issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>to the Service Meeting for the weeks thus affected. The day-by-day review of the convention program may be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers. This well-prepared review will focus on key points for personal application and use in the field. Any experiences used or comments from the audience should be brief and to the point.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How do Christians cope when armies overrun a country, as they did in Korea in the 1950’s, or when violence is a daily threat, as it has been for years in parts of Ireland? What course do they take in order to stand for righteous principles?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <em>1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>is filled with experiences of Christians standing firm for righteousness during the war in Korea and during the years of violence in Ireland. The <em>Yearbook </em>also provides a historical account of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Costa Rica, as well as an up-to-date picture of their work worldwide.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the <em>1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>I enclose $1 (U.S.).</p>

Christians in the Midst of War
How do Christians cope when armies overrun a country, as they did in Korea in the 1950’s, or when violence is a daily threat, as it has been for years in parts of Ireland? What course do they take in order to stand for righteous principles?
The 1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses is filled with experiences of Christians standing firm for righteousness during the war in Korea and during the years of violence in Ireland. The Yearbook also provides a historical account of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Costa Rica, as well as an up-to-date picture of their work worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>□ What is the answer to today’s problem of teenage pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">Youths must be given moral and spiritual guidance. The Bible shows that parents have the responsibility to do this. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>)​—4/15, page 4.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>□ What makes it difficult to raise children successfully?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Parents and children are imperfect and, hence, make mistakes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Also, growing children are very much influenced by the bad tendencies of present-day society; this adversely affects their values and outlook on life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>)​—5/1, page 4.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>□ What are four striking differences between true Christians and nominal Christians?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">True Christians abstain from blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) They maintain a high moral standard. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) Genuine Christians remain neutral toward politics and the many national conflicts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Those who follow Jesus use his example as a model for their domestic relations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:21-49:5:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:21-25</a>)​—5/1, pages 17-19.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>□ Why did the Jews call Jesus a Samaritan? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:48-43:8:48" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>John 8:48</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">The Jews hated the Samaritans. Hence, the term was used by them as an expression of contempt and reproach against Jesus.​—5/15, page 8.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>□ What is the “pure language” spoken about at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Zephaniah 3:9</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">This is the language of Scriptural truth that enables God-fearing people of all nations and races to serve Jehovah shoulder to shoulder.​—5/15, page 16.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>□ What freedoms result from developing a relationship with God?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">Freedom from the enslaving fear of man and from the burdensome customs that have no real meaning or value. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>) Also, freedom from the fear of death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> John 5:28, 29</a>)​—6/1, pages 5-6.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>□ What did Jesus mean when he said: “The night is coming when no man can work”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:4-43:9:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>John 9:4</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Jesus was here referring to the time when he would go into the grave and would no longer be able to perform the marvelous works that he had performed while alive.​—6/1, page 8.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>□ What does water baptism signify?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Complete immersion in water is a fitting symbol of a person’s dedication to God, whereby the individual becomes an ordained minister. While under the water, he, in effect, dies to his former course of life, and on coming out of the water, he becomes, as it were, alive to a new course of self-sacrifice in Jehovah’s service. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:2-45:6:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 6:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:16-50:3:16" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Philippians 3:16</a>.)​—6/15, page 29.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>□ What are some ways to demonstrate thankfulness to Jehovah?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">When thankfulness is strong, an impelling desire to serve God wells up in the appreciative heart. One way to satisfy this desire is to engage in the ministry, perhaps in the pioneer service. Another is to cooperate in the building program now taking place around the earth.​—7/1, page 11.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>□ Why did Jesus empower 70 of his disciples to cure the sick when he sent them out on a preaching campaign in Galilee?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">These disciples, by performing such miracles, prepared the way for Jesus to do follow-up work. The miracles they performed would make many of the householders eager to meet Jesus and listen to his Kingdom message.​—7/1, pages 16-17.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>□ Was Jesus referring to Judas when he told Pilate: “The man that handed me over to you has greater sin”?​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:11-43:19:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>John 19:11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">It seems that Jesus was referring to all those who were responsible for his being on trial before Pilate. That certainly included Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:2-42:22:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 22:2-6</a>) But the high priest Caiaphas and other religious leaders were also involved in bringing about Jesus’ arrest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:59-40:26:65" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 26:59-65;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:1-40:27:2" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 27:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:20-40:27:23" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 20-23</a>) Likely all these guilty ones were included in what Jesus said at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:11-43:19:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 19:11</a>.​—7/15, page 30.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>□ What particularly lethal danger is connected with image worship?</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">The psalmist said of the Israelites: “Serving the pagans’ idols, they found themselves trapped into sacrificing their own sons and daughters to demons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:36-19:106:37" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 106:36, 37</a>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em>) The Christian Greek Scriptures warn of the same danger. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:19-46:10:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:19, 20</a>) Image worship of any sort opens up the possibility that an image will serve as a contact point for demonic forces.​—8/1, page 6.</p>

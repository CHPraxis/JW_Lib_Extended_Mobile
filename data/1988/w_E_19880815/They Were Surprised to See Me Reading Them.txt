They Were Surprised to See Me Reading Them
A youth from the Philippines writes: “I am a first year high school student and a fervent Catholic. When a friend introduced me to the Awake! and The Watchtower, I happened to accept them. I find them very interesting even though they are published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. As I read them in our classroom, my classmates were surprised, since I am a Catholic. I gave my classmates one, and they also liked it. The magazine also reached my religion teacher, and this teacher showed interest, since it dealt with today’s moral problems. I hope you will continue this printing.”

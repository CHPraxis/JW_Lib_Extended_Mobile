He picks on less experienced, seducing them as he did Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1</a>) Deceives youths by enticements, allurements, temptations. Promotes idea that youths in truth are missing out on something. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5</a>) Cultivates selfish desire to do own thing, decide for self what is good and bad. Satan makes ways of world, such as sexual immorality, smoking, drug abuse, association with nonbelievers, and worldly entertainment, look attractive. Makes such appear harmless, as fruit on tree appeared to Eve.

Why is a lifetime in Jehovah’s service the best way of life? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Eccl. 12:1</a>) As time permits, interview one or two exemplary youths who have cultivated wholesome desires.

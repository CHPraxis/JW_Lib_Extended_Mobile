Subscriptions
1 Subscriptions to The Watchtower and Awake! have helped many to become acquainted with God’s Word. What can we do to ensure that subscribers continue getting the best service possible?
2 Accuracy in filling out the subscription blank cannot be overstressed. Fine improvement has been achieved in this area. However, a growing problem is occurring when a subscriber moves. Often the Society is not immediately informed and the subscription service is interrupted.
3 The postal service returns all undeliverable magazines to the Society at a charge of 30¢ each. In 1987 the Society had to spend more than $50,000 to cover postage on these returned undeliverable magazines. Most of these were returned because the subscriber had moved. Notices of address changes supplied to the postal service generally do not apply to our magazines. Therefore, in order to have the address changed for Watchtower and Awake! subscriptions, the Society’s Subscription Change of Address form (M-205) must be sent in to give the new address. Your assistance in this will help the Society keep its handling costs at a minimum.
4 All Expiring Subscription slips should be given immediate attention. Publishers are encouraged to follow through immediately in obtaining renewals and turning these in to the brother caring for subscriptions. Both new and renewal subscriptions obtained from unbaptized people may be reported by the publisher. (See Our Ministry, page 102.) However, it is helpful to the Society to have the renewals sent in as early as possible. All subscriptions should be sent to the Society weekly.

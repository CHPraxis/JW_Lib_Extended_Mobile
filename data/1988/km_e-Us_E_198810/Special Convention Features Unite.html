<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 133:1</a>) After enjoying our “Divine Justice” District Convention program with its various special features, these words have taken on added meaning for the worldwide brotherhood of Jehovah’s people.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Anticipation was aroused when it was announced that selected talks on the convention program would be tied in to all convention cities each week by means of telephone transmission. Then when the stimulating information was given by each speaker, we rejoiced that we could be present and participate. And what a joy it was to be tied in with so many brothers in shouting “Aye!” to the powerful Resolution!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Special, also, was the release of the two-volume publication entitled <em>Insight on the Scriptures. </em>What a beautifully illustrated publication! How it will unite us in researching Bible subjects so that we may speak in agreement on the real meaning of the Scriptures!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>What a pleasant surprise we received on Saturday afternoon when the announcement came that a new publication entitled <em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax at Hand! </em>was being released. This 320-page book will certainly help us unite our thoughts on the meaning of the many symbolic expressions found in the last book of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Not to be forgotten was the special feature of having missionaries relate their personal experiences at many of the conventions. How we appreciate their years of faithful service! Despite many obstacles, such as failing health, language problems, and opposition, they have expanded the preaching of the good news in distant lands.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Certainly Jehovah has blessed us with more than we ever anticipated. Now it is our determination to bear witness concerning divine justice so that still other righteoushearted ones may respond.</p>

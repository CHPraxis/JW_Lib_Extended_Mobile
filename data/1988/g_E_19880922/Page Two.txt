“The silent emergencies”
James P. Grant, executive director of UNICEF (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund), thus described the unheralded deaths of millions of Third World children. He referred, though, not to casualties of the highly publicized African famine, but to victims of silent calamities: deaths by malnutrition, not starvation; deaths by dehydration, not thirst; deaths by disease, not drought.
Why does such tragedy continue? What can parents do to protect their children? Awake! now takes an illuminating and perhaps disturbing look at these questions.

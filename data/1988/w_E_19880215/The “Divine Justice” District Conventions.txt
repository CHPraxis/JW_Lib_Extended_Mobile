The “Divine Justice” District Conventions
WHAT a great deal of suffering there is in the world due to a lack of justice! Widespread abuse of power on the part of some political rulers has resulted in much unjust suffering. Greedy commercial interests oppress people, resulting in much hardship. Then there is the oppression of religious leaders today who are like their counterparts in Jesus’ day, and of whom he said: “They bind up heavy loads and put them upon the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger.” (Matthew 23:4) There is also much abuse of power and resultant injustice within family circles.
History shows that it would be futile to look to imperfect men, however well-meaning these might be, to remedy such matters. But there exists in the heavens the Supreme Being and Judge, Jehovah. He is the God of justice. Rightly, Moses sang: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.”​—Deuteronomy 32:4.
Jehovah has long tolerated all the injustices of this world, but he will not do so for all time. There is an appointed time for him to act and then the prophecy found at Isaiah 14:4-7 will be fulfilled, which promises that all manner of tyranny will cease and ‘the whole earth will come to rest.’
Because of their firm faith in these prophetic promises, Jehovah’s Witnesses delight to proclaim far and wide that soon Jehovah will bring an end to all oppression, unrighteousness, and injustice by ushering in complete Kingdom rule. Then no one will cause any harm or ruin, for ‘the whole earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.’​—Isaiah 11:9.
To strengthen our faith in Jehovah’s righteous judgments, the 1988 district conventions will have the theme “Divine Justice.” Stressing this theme will not only spur us on in making known our hope for divine justice but also encourage us to act in harmony with divine justice in all our dealings.
As Jehovah’s servants, all of us know that because of the transgression of our first parents, our inclination is toward selfishness, toward injustice. So we will appreciate the fine information that we will receive by means of Bible lectures, demonstrations, interviews, and dramas that will underscore the need to uphold divine justice. This is in keeping with the command at Micah 6:8, ‘to exercise justice, love kindness, and be modest in walking with our God.’ This makes for harmony, contentment, and joy; it also helps to further the preaching of the good news in all the earth.
An outstanding feature of these conventions will be that a number of cities will be tied in for special talks by members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Also, for these conventions missionaries throughout the world will have transportation provided for them; this will also enable them to visit with their families again.
Jehovah willing, the “Divine Justice” District Conventions will begin Thursday at 1:30 p.m. and will conclude at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. Let us arrange our affairs to be on hand when the program begins and plan to stay until the closing song and prayer every day. Come with a good spiritual appetite and equipped to take notes. Be assured that Jehovah has in store for us “a banquet” of good things that will strengthen and stimulate us for the work ahead.​—Isaiah 25:6; Song of Solomon 2:4.
Yes, let each one come determined to get the greatest possible spiritual blessing from the “Divine Justice” District Conventions.

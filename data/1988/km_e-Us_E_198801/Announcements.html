<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The special public talk for the 1988 Memorial season will be given worldwide on Sunday, April 10, 1988. The subject of this talk will be “Why Live by Bible Standards?” An outline will be provided soon. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a Sunday special assembly day scheduled that week will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 10.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Selective Service regulations require that all men register when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind when young brothers are nearing the age of 18 and give them appropriate reminders. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● As announced at the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention last summer, 16 new public talk outlines have been prepared. As soon as these are received, they should be assigned to qualified speakers and scheduled to be given in the congregations.</p>

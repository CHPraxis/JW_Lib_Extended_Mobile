‘They Lifted Me Out of Deep Depression’
A woman from England wrote:
“Dear Sir:
“In February I sent for your cassette album of My Book of Bible Stories, and although I am a spiritualist, when they arrived I was so impressed with them. I had just come out of the hospital after a major operation and was in bed feeling really low and depressed. So when my husband brought the parcel up to me, I decided to play the tapes along with the book.
“They certainly lifted me out of my deep depression, and for the first time in ten days I actually felt like taking an interest in my surroundings. When my grandsons (6 and 8 years) came to visit, I let them hear these, and they were so delighted with the part they had time to hear that I let them take them home to listen to them all. Obviously, as they have received so much pleasure from them, I would be grateful if you could forward me another set of the cassette tapes and book so that they can keep theirs.”
She added this P.S.: “During my life I have many times tried reading my Bible but have never enjoyed or understood it. Yet these tapes and book explain it all so clearly.”

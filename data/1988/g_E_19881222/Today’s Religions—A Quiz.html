<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT do people believe? Religious leaders are disturbed to find that many no longer believe what they have been taught.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Indeed, today’s religious scene has changed drastically since 1961 when <em>Awake! </em>published a well-received quiz entitled “How Well Do You Know Your Religion?” With this issue, we again invite our readers to test their background knowledge of contemporary religion and its age-old traditions. But this time the emphasis is on the <em>crisis </em>facing world religion<strong>, </strong>focusing on such developments as the modern phenomenon of people’s drifting belief and religion’s new assertiveness in politics and war.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why not take your pencil and answer the quizzes on this page and the next three pages? Then compare your answers with the authorities cited on the answer pages. See if the results help you familiarize yourself with today’s religious situation.</p>

<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="sm"> 1. <strong><em>True. </em></strong><em>The Bible writers freely admit that they wrote by inspiration and that God required them to record their own embarrassing mistakes and shortcomings. </em>David, whose numerous Bible psalms candidly exposed national shortcomings and his own private sins, explained: “The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:2-10:23:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="si">Also, Daniel wrote about future events that he acknowledged he “could not understand.” He asked: “O my lord, what will be the final part of these things?” The answer given him was: “Go, Daniel, because the words are made secret and sealed up until the time of the end.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:8-27:12:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 12:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="si">Yes, Bible writers foretold events that were beyond their ability to understand at the time. Therefore the apostle Peter admits: “No prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sm"> 2. <strong><em>False. </em></strong><em>The Bible does not assign Christendom’s clergy the job of protecting the laity from hellfire. </em>The fact is, the hellfire teaching is not found in the Bible. The Bible teaches that the dead are unconscious, feeling no pain. It says: “As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, . . . for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [“hell” in older editions of the Bible], the place to which you are going.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="si">The Bible does not authorize the setting up of a clergy class distinct from those with a so-called laity status. Jesus taught his followers: “All you are brothers.” And he strictly forbade using such titles as “Rabbi,” “Father,” or “Leader.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 23:8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="sm"> 3. <strong><em>True. </em></strong><em>The Bible indicated that the earth was round when men thought it was flat. </em>In the eighth century before Christ, when men still believed the earth was flat, Isaiah wrote: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p129" data-pid="129" class="sm"> 1. <strong><em>330,000,000 </em></strong>Hindu divinities: Regarding the common man in India, Professor J. B. Noss says: “Even though experience usually leads him to adopt one particular god or goddess as a patron . . . , he honors nevertheless all supernatural beings . . .

<p id="p131" data-pid="131" class="sm"> 3. <strong><em>Buddhism </em></strong>does not teach belief in a creator. “It admits no beings with greater supernatural power than man can reach by virtue and knowledge; in fact, several of the Buddhist nations have no word in their languages to express the idea of God.”​—McClintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopedia.</em></p>
<p id="p132" data-pid="132" class="sm"> 4. <strong><em>Most ancient non-Christian religions: </em></strong>Abbott’s <em>Dictionary of Religious Knowledge </em>calls the Trinity a “very marked” feature in the Hindu religion and “discernible” in the ancient [pre-Christian] religions of Persia, Egypt, Rome, Japan, India, and Greece. According to Professor E. W. Hopkins, a Neoplatonic philosopher named Plotinus (205-270 C.E.) “evolved” a form of trinity similar to the orthodox Buddhist and Brahmanic trinity. Professor Hopkins said of Plotinus: “His theology which was called ‘Platonic,’ had no little influence upon the leaders of Christian opinion.”</p>
<p id="p133" data-pid="133" class="si">Did this philosopher influence Christendom’s leaders more than Jesus himself did? Professor Hopkins answers: “To Jesus and Paul the doctrine of the trinity was apparently unknown; at any rate, they say nothing about it.”​—<em>Origin and Evolution of Religion.</em></p>

It says: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p141" data-pid="141" class="sm"> 3. <strong><em>Stay neutral regarding worldly politics while looking to God’s Kingdom for the remedy</em></strong></p>
<p id="p142" data-pid="142" class="si">Jesus commanded neutrality, and pointed to God’s Kingdom, saying: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up [to an unjust death sentence].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus also told the apostle Peter, when Peter took up a weapon in his defense: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:52-40:26:52" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 26:52</a>.</p>
<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="si">Demonstrating his faith in God’s Kingdom as the remedy for mankind’s problems, Jesus proclaimed that government as man’s only hope. While on earth, he explained: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="si">According to <em>The Encyclopedia Americana, </em>“Jesus’ method was to go to the people, especially to the common folk and even the classes most despised, the ‘tax-collectors and sinners’ . . . His central theme was the Kingdom of God . . . The Kingdom message involved repentance and grateful faith in God; it required taking up a new life of obedience in fellowship with others who were waiting in hope for God to establish His Kingdom, which had begun to come in the work of Jesus. The final establishment of the kingdom . . . by the powerful action of God at the end of the age . . . was eagerly expected.”​—Volume 3, page 704 (1977).</p>
<p id="p145" data-pid="145" class="sm"> 4. <strong><em>Men will practice only a form of godly devotion but prove false to its power</em></strong></p>
<p id="p146" data-pid="146" class="si">The Bible foretold: “Know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be . . . lovers of <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power . . . Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” “They will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:3-55:4:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 4:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p147" data-pid="147" class="si">The Bible also warned: “Many false prophets [apparently the same type of popular leaders referred to above] will arise and mislead many; and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:11-40:24:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:11-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p148" data-pid="148" class="sm"> 5. <strong><em>National rulers will totally destroy the religions of the world</em></strong></p>
<p id="p149" data-pid="149" class="si">The Bible points to this outcome. Throughout the centuries, false religion has been deeply involved in the political affairs of the nations, even though Jesus said regarding his true disciples: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Because of hobnobbing with the world, false religion is depicted in the Bible as a prostitute, or harlot, who has not been faithful to God. A Bible prophecy says: “Come, I will show you the judgment upon the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:18-66:17:18" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p150" data-pid="150" class="si">This “great harlot” is thus like a woman caught selling sexual favors in return for high-level influence in government. Her punishment fits the crime. God will cause a sudden, foreboding change of heart among her former lovers. The Bible explains that the kings, or political rulers of the world, “will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire. For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:12-66:17:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 17:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:17" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p153" data-pid="153" class="sm"> 1. <strong><em>False</em></strong></p>
<p id="p154" data-pid="154" class="si">When Jesus said “the kingdom of God is within you,” he was speaking to hostile Pharisees, his enemies, not his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:21-42:17:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 17:21</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) What, then, did Jesus mean when talking with these Pharisees? Modern Bible translations, such as the <em>Revised Standard Version, </em>render Jesus’ words: “The kingdom of God is in the midst of you.” The Kingdom was in their <em>midst, </em>since Jesus, the one designated to be King of that future Kingdom, was there among those Pharisees.</p>
<p id="p155" data-pid="155" class="si">Thus the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>states: “By ‘kingdom’ He seems to have meant not principally the realm of God, but the reign of God . . . In this sense it is valid to describe Jesus’ view of the kingdom as futuristic . . . Jesus Himself appears in the Gospels as the herald . . . Therefore He could say to His enemies that the kingdom was ‘in the midst of you’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:21-42:17:21" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke XVII, 21</a>, not ‘within you’); for He himself was the sign of the kingdom in their midst.”</p>
<p id="p156" data-pid="156" class="sm"> 2. <strong><em>True</em></strong></p>
<p id="p157" data-pid="157" class="si">That God’s Kingdom is a real government is made clear at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which says of the coming Messiah: “The government shall be upon his shoulder.” (<em>American Standard Version</em>) “The princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder.”​—<em>New World Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p158" data-pid="158" class="sm"> 3. <strong><em>False</em></strong></p>
<p id="p159" data-pid="159" class="si">The Kingdom of God could not be represented on earth by the United Nations, for Jesus plainly taught: “My kingdom is no part of this world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p160" data-pid="160" class="si">God’s Kingdom is nonpolitical; it is brought about by God without human help. As the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>puts it: “It is therefore foreign to Jesus’ teaching when Christians speak of their ‘building the kingdom.’ Clearly, He directed His hearers to that which was to come when He spoke to them about the kingdom.”</p>
<p id="p161" data-pid="161" class="sm"> 4. <strong><em>True</em></strong></p>
<p id="p162" data-pid="162" class="si">The Bible prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a> clearly shows that God’s Kingdom will destroy the kingdoms, or governments, of the world. It says: “In the days of those kings [modern-day governments] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. . . . It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”</p>
<p id="p163" data-pid="163" class="si">As to the blessings in store for humanity after God destroys these conflicting nations, see the book, <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>This publication gives Biblical and historical <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>proof that in 1914, God’s Kingdom began its long-awaited rule in heaven​—with the consequence that universal peace will arrive before the generation of that time passes away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 24:34</a>) In the words of a prophetic Bible psalm: “Evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

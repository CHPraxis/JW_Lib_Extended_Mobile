<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have come to treasure the cassettes,” writes a woman from Germany. “The reason?” she asks. “I was involved in a minor car crash and fractured my skull. So I have for the past 8 days laid in the hospital with a headache that prevented me from reading, sitting up, etc.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I lay at night in the dark, when it was especially difficult to sleep, and watched a film in my head as I listened to Genesis, Exodus . . . I am now getting acquainted with the apostles Peter and John through their letters, always loved, but now appreciated in every detail as I play them over and over.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I thank you from the bottom of my heart that my hours of pain and loneliness were not so unbearable because of your forethought and diligence in looking after our spiritual interests.”</p>

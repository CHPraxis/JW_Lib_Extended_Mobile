<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines were valued by a Protestant minister from Málaga, Spain. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have been a Protestant pastor for several years, and I can assure you that in all my theological studies, I have not found the simplicity and clarity that your publications have. To me, Jehovah’s Witnesses are admirable people; in a hypocritical world, they live according to what they believe. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“At the moment, due to personal problems, I can’t study with you, as I would like to, but thanks to God, I do receive your magazines, and they are ‘bread’ and ‘water’ to my heart, which hungers and thirsts for the living God.”</p>

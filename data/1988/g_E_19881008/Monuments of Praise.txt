Monuments of Praise
Majestic mountains have long impressed thinking persons with man’s littleness. Standing near towering crags, it is difficult not to be awed by their vastness and height. Imposing, lofty, these soaring rock masses were thought by some cultures to be the obvious dwelling places of their gods.
In addition to their grandeur, mountains collect and store water or channel it to rivers and lakes. Mountains support plant life, lower areas being excellent places for growing grain and fruit. They also serve as a place of refuge for both man and animals. Mountains are fitting monuments to the praise of their Maker.​—Amos 4:13.

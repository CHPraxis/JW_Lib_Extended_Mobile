He Ordered 50 Copies!
When the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? was released over two years ago, a woman in England thought it would be an ideal gift for her uncle, an influential 84-year-old businessman in the Yorkshire area. So she gave him a copy.
Within a week he called her and said: “Marvelous, that book is just marvelous. Can you get me some more copies? I would like to give them as gifts to my business colleagues.”
Only 25 were immediately available, and he quickly distributed these among his associates. But he wanted 25 more. These were soon obtained, and he gave these to his colleagues as well​—50 in all!
Perhaps you feel about the Creation book much the way this businessman does. Do you know someone with whom you would like to share this marvelous publication? Why not send that person a gift copy? You can do so by simply filling in and mailing the coupon below, enclosing just $2.50 with the coupon.
Please send, postpaid, a gift copy of the 256-page book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? as well as a letter explaining that it is a gift from ____ (your name). I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

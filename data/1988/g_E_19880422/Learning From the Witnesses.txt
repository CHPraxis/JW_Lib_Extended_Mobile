Learning From the Witnesses

“The success of sports teams and youth-group projects is often dependent on the willingness of each member to lend a hand. These should take note of the way Jehovah’s Witnesses organize their projects. Much can be learned by observing the willing spirit they display. It is almost unbelievable.”

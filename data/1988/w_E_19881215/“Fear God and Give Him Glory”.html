<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">WHOM SHOULD WE FEAR? Surely not the fiery-red dragon, Satan, and his hosts of demons! Christ Jesus hurled these out of heaven following the Kingdom’s birth in 1914. But the visions of Apocalypse next reveal the organization that Satan uses here on earth in his last-ditch effort to thwart God’s purposes. Prominent in this picturization are two ferocious wild beasts and a drunken prostitute​—Babylon the Great. Should we be afraid of these? Far from it! Rather, we should fear Jehovah and his Christ, whose Kingdom has now brought Satan’s corrupt world to its final judgment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 10:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:12" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 12:9-12</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 2. What wild beast comes into view in the eighth vision, and what does it represent?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>As <strong>the eighth vision </strong>of Revelation unfolds, a wild beast rises from the turbulent sea of humankind. It has seven heads and ten horns with ten diadems, signifying regal authority bestowed on it by Satan. It blasphemes Jehovah, mauling His servants as would a leopard, a bear, or a lion; but its authority is temporary, being derived from the dragon, Satan, whom it closely resembles. The prophet Daniel had earlier described earthly political governments as beasts, and the governments themselves have often chosen creatures of the wild as their national symbols, such as the British lion and the American eagle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:5-27:8:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 8:5-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:20-27:8:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 20-22</a>) Now, though, we see a composite beast, embracing all the political powers of Bible history that have so often oppressed God’s true servants on earth. Outstanding “heads” among these have been Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and lastly the Anglo-American Dual World Power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:3-66:12:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 7-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3. (a) How did one of the heads of the wild beast receive a “sword-stroke”? (b) How does the two-horned wild beast take the lead in making an image to the first wild beast? (c) What is the name of the first wild beast and the significance of the name?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>During the world war of 1914-18, Great Britain, as the seventh world power, <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>received a “sword-stroke” that could have been fatal. But the United States of America came to her rescue. Since then, America and Britain have cooperated as a dual world power, which John goes on to describe as a wild beast with two horns, coming out of an established human society, “the earth.” This two-horned beast takes the lead in making an image to the first wild beast and breathing life into it, portraying how the Anglo-American World Power became chief sponsor and life-giver both to the League of Nations and to its successor, the United Nations. The first wild beast has a number-name, 666. Six is an imperfect number​—short of the Biblically perfect seven—​so that six to the third degree suggests the woeful imperfection of today’s human rulers. Though Jehovah’s Witnesses respect government and are exemplary in obeying the laws of the land in which they live, they courageously refuse to <em>worship </em>“the wild beast” or its image.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:3-66:13:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 13:3-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 13:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4. (a) Who are seen standing on the heavenly Mount Zion, and who are pictured by the 24 elders before God’s throne? (b) What is the distinction between the “new song” sung by the anointed and the “new song” sung by the great crowd?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>For the present, enough of those beasts! In refreshing contrast, <strong>the ninth vision </strong>focuses on the Lamb. He stands on Mount Zion, with the 144,000 that he buys as firstfruits from among mankind. Though some of these still serve on earth, in a spiritual sense all 144,000 have “approached a Mount Zion and . . . heavenly Jerusalem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22</a>) Appropriately, the 24 elders are also seen here before God’s throne, for they picture the same anointed group from a different standpoint​—as already raised and installed as kings and priests. The 144,000 are singing “a new song.” It stems from their unique experience in being bought from the earth to become Kingdom heirs. The great crowd also “sing to Jehovah a new song,” but this differs in that they sing in prospect of attaining to everlasting life in the earthly realm of the Kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Psalm 96:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:34" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Matthew 25:31-34</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The vision now expands. John sees another angel flying in midheaven. And what glad tidings he has to proclaim! It is everlasting good news, for it means eternal life for those out of every nation and tribe and tongue and people who obey God in this hour of his judgment. In contrast with the gruesome beasts that John has just described, why should not this marvelous God be worshiped, yes, adored? He is the One who created heaven and earth. He is the Source of everything that exists, animate and inanimate. There is strong reason, then, for the angel to command in stentorian tones: “FEAR GOD AND GIVE HIM GLORY”! The voice of the angel is heard around the earth, and Jehovah’s Witnesses echo his rousing invitation to all mankind in some 200 languages.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:11-23:45:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isaiah 45:11, 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Another angel appears. Startling indeed is the message that he proclaims: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the anger of her fornication!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:8-66:14:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 14:8</a>) Who is Babylon the Great, that she can even seduce nations and intoxicate them?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 7. What is Babylon the Great, and how did it develop?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Ancient Babylon was the fountainhead of false religion, which expanded earth wide to become a demonistic world empire, labeled appropriately “Babylon the Great.” In course of time, Rome became prominent in that religious empire, for it was under Rome <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>that apostate Christianity developed. Rome continues to be a world center for Babylonish religion. This was clearly apparent in 1986 when the world’s religious leaders answered the call of the pope of Rome by assembling with him at Assisi, near Rome, to pray in behalf of the International Year of Peace proclaimed by the United Nations.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 8. (a) How did Babylon the Great suffer a great fall, and since when is this in evidence? (b) What shows that the prayers of religious leaders for peace go unanswered?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>However, Babylon the Great has suffered a great fall! Since 1919 this has been in evidence in the dwindling support for false religion worldwide. Atheistic communism now controls large areas of the earth. Today’s youth are being taught evolution, which contradicts God’s Word. In Protestant Europe few people attend church anymore, and an itinerant pope is struggling to hold his Catholic empire together. Prayers to the multiplicity of gods of the world’s religions obviously go unanswered. Ruth L. Sivard reported: “Twenty-two wars were underway in 1987, more wars than in any previous year in recorded history. The total death toll in these wars so far is at least 2,200,000​—and rising fast.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> How ineffectual the Assisi prayer meeting proved to be! And yet the pope marked the 1987 anniversary of that assembly by producing a medal with his likeness on one side and a symbol of the prayer meeting on the other. They keep “saying, ‘There is peace! There is peace!’ when there is no peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:14-24:6:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:14</a>.</p>

Her clergy have become notorious for their immoral ways. TV evangelizers have sheared their flocks of hundreds of millions of dollars, while at the same time they were committing blatant immorality. The Catholic priesthood is also much in question, as is indicated by the following report in <em>The Beacon Journal </em>of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, January 3, 1988: “Hundreds of children molested by Catholic priests in the United States during the past five years have suffered severe emotional trauma, say parents, psychologists, police officers and attorneys involved in the cases.” Sexual immorality has blackened the reputation of many of the clergy of Babylon the Great.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10. (a) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:3-66:18:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 18:3</a>, what is denoted by the “fornication” of Babylon the Great?

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>“The wine of the anger of her fornication,” though, has particular reference to false religion’s courting the rulers, supporting their political campaigns and wars, and compelling the people to worship some nationalistic segment of the wild beast. Politicians have often found religion to be a useful partner in gaining their ends, as can be seen in Hitler’s concordat with the Vatican in 1933 and the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. During World War II, the clergy of Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist, and other religions on both sides acted as though intoxicated by the nationalistic fervor of war. They share a heavy bloodguilt for the tens of millions of soldiers and civilians who have died in war since 1914. The clergy who supported the Fascists and the Nazis are also bloodguilty on account of the Witnesses of Jehovah, and others, who were executed or who died in concentration camps.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:34-24:2:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:3-66:18:3" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Revelation 18:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>

Anointed Christians who “die in union with the Lord” have been counted happy, for “the things they did go right with them.” As for any of the great crowd who may die under persecutions, from illness, or by accidents, the friendship that they have cultivated with God assures them of an early resurrection into the “new earth” society.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>As the judgment proceeds, angels call for two harvestings. The first Harvester is clearly Jesus, enthroned in Kingdom glory since 1914, for he rides on a white cloud, is crowned, and is “like a son of man.” Now, in the Lord’s day, he reaps the earth, first of the remaining anointed Christians and then of the millions of the great crowd. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:34" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:1-43:15:1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> John 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:5-43:15:5" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:16-43:15:16" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 16</a>.) In contrast, the second harvest is that of “the vine of the earth,” which is thrown into “the great winepress of the anger of God.” This is the judgment executed at Har–Magedon, when a wicked, tangled human society is uprooted and its poisonous fruit crushed to a pulp. May Jehovah be glorified in clearing the earth of this poisonous vine!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:14-66:14:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 14:14-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

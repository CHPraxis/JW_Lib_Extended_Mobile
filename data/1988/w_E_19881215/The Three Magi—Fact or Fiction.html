<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“C + M + B”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do these letters mean anything to you? If you live within a Roman Catholic area of the Federal Republic of Germany, they might. There you will often see the letters along with the year chalked on doorposts. Why is that?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Popular legend has it that these letters are the initials in German of the so-called three Magi, or “wise men,” Gaspar (German, <em>C</em>aspar), <em>M</em>elchior, and <em>B</em>althasar.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Supposedly, the Magi’s bones were transferred to Cologne in the year 1164 and later deposited in the city’s cathedral, thus making Cologne the center of their devotion. Yearly, on January 6​—known as the Feast of the Three Holy Kings—​groups of youths dressed as ancient kings go from door to door chalking the letters onto doorposts. According to custom, this offers householders protection from misfortune.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Religious art and tradition imply that the three Magi, or “kings,” were led by a “star” to where Jesus was born. In view of the honor, even devotion, accorded these “kings,” the question arises as to whether this belief is based on the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Matthew is the only Gospel that refers to these visitors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2:1-12</a>) But does Matthew mention that there were three and that they were kings, and does he record their names? The Catholic newspaper <em>Kirchenzeitung für das Bistum Aachen </em>admits: “The Three Holy Kings are not referred to as such in the Bible. Starting in the sixth century, the wise men were understood to have been . . . three kings. . . . As to the number of astrologers, . . . Matthew gives no details. . . . In the ninth century they first appeared under the names Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar.” Furthermore, the Catholic reference work <em>Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche </em>notes that the Greek word <em>maʹgoi </em>does not mean kings but, rather, “ones having secret knowledge of astrology.” Justin Martyr, Origen, and Tertullian each understood the word to mean “astrologer.” Modern Bible <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>translations also use “astrologers” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:7-40:2:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>.​—<em>The Living Bible; An American Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Although Nativity scenes of Jesus as a baby invariably include the “three kings,” were they present at his birth? The lexicon adds: “<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:16-40:2:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 2:16</a> indicates that the visit took place perhaps one year or more after the birth of Jesus.” Indeed, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:11-40:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 2 verse 11</a> speaks of a “house,” not a stable, where they “saw the young child.”​—<em>King James Version.</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What about the term “Holy Kings”? Can the visitors properly be called holy? Scripture never describes them as such. They were, in fact, violators of divine principle. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:13-23:47:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:13, 14</a>, God condemns “worshipers [“astrologers,” according to the <em>Septuagint</em>] of the heavens, the lookers at the stars.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>.) These astrologers came “from eastern parts,” most likely the then center of occult worship, <em>unholy </em>Babylon, where they worshiped false gods. Thus, they were guided by what they thought was a moving “star,” which no one else is reported to have seen. Also, Matthew shows that the “star” led them first to King Herod, who then tried to have Jesus killed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">No, God did not send a “star” to conduct them to Jesus. Is it not more likely that this “star” was sent by someone seeking to destroy Jesus before he was able to fulfill his God-given assignment?​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jesus warned that the Word of God could be made “invalid” by mixing it with “tradition.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:6-40:15:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 15:6</a>) The traditions surrounding these persons are clearly unscriptural. Therefore, do you not agree that it would be wrong to venerate the astrologers or to regard them as holy?</p>

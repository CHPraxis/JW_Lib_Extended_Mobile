‘I Did Not Expect to Enjoy It’
THAT is what a person wrote to a friend who had sent a gift copy of the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? “I’m sure you have wondered if I got the book,” the person wrote. “Yes! Thank you! Did I read it? Also yes. I was very surprised to find it thrilling.
“I did not at all expect to enjoy it, in fact, just started it so I could say to you ‘Well, I tried.’ To my dismay I wasn’t able to put it aside. . . . It took maybe 10 days to finish. I was entranced. I quickly told some friends about it​—loaned it to two of them and promised it to a third! So at least 4 of us here will read it and many more, I expect. It is really a wonderful book. Again, thank you.”

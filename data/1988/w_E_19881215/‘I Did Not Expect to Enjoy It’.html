<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is what a person wrote to a friend who had sent a gift copy of the book <em>Life​</em>—<em>How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>“I’m sure you have wondered if I got the book,” the person wrote. “Yes! Thank you! Did I read it? Also yes. I was very surprised to find it thrilling.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I did not at all expect to enjoy it, in fact, just started it so I could say to you ‘Well, I tried.’ To my dismay I wasn’t able to put it aside. . . . It took maybe 10 days to finish. I was entranced. I quickly told some friends about it​—loaned it to two of them and promised it to a third! So at least 4 of us here will read it and many more, I expect. It is really a wonderful book. Again, thank you.”</p>

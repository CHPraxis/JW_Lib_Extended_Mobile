<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW much can a very young child pick up from a television commercial? Too much, according to pediatrician Dr. Percy Barsky of Winnipeg, Canada. The realization came, says <em>The Toronto Star, </em>when a three-year-old told Barsky that he wanted “the ultimate weapon” for Christmas. As a result, Public Action for Children’s Television is seeking to have all toy advertising on television banned. “Violent toys” can breed violence, asserts Barsky. Reporting a survey conducted by the Cancer Research Campaign in Glasgow, Scotland, <em>The Times </em>of London notes: “Children as young as six are more influenced by cigarette advertising than adults have realized.” In both cases the dangers are obvious, but where does the remedy lie? Surely with the parents, who have the ultimate responsibility for their children’s welfare by monitoring what they are permitted to watch on television.</p>

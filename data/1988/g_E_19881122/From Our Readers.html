<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I normally find your magazines well researched, so I was amazed to note mistakes in “Why Some Are Mean and Others Mild” (March 22, 1988). The dog called Pete in <em>Our Gang </em>was not a pit bull but an American bulldog. There are no white pit bulls with “black eyes”; the dog pictured on page 26 is not an Akita; there are no aggressive dogs, just aggressive dog owners. If a dog goes “crazy,” the owner is at fault.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>The source (“Sports Illustrated”) states that pit bull Pete’s black circle was “almost certainly the work of a make-up artist.” We stand by our identification of an Akita among the group pictured. Readers’ comments below may bear on your other point.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As a healthy pastime, I train pit bulls, and I know from my experience of many years that certain pit bulls are a little difficult to manage, and in some cases they can be “dangerous.” But this is not the principal personality of these canines​—the character of the dog is “molded” by the owner. I agree with the article 100 percent. However, some who have read it claim that the article emphasized that pit bulls are “born killers” and “criminal from birth” without exception. I wish with all respect that you would make this point clear, since many are going to extremes about this breed after reading the article.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">You presented the material in a way that helps people to understand the importance of the temperament of <em>all </em>dogs, plus the vital role the owner plays. As owners of a pit bull dog, we have found that with the proper training, a pit bull can be one of the most lovable pets. But I don’t think that anyone that owns a dog for a pet could make the statement, “He won’t bite,” for animals are animals. We can’t predict their behavior.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">With so much media hype about pit bulls, it was good to read a balanced article showing that much of the problem is attributable to abusive owners (some actually feed their dogs gunpowder and/​or metal shavings) and uncontrolled inbreeding, either of which can cause instability <em>in any breed </em>of dog.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Running Away</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Is Running Away the Answer?” (March 22, 1988) talks of a 14-year-old girl who ran away because she didn’t have a close relationship with her parents and felt she couldn’t talk to them. She felt that there was no one who would understand her. I’m 14 years old, and recently I had the same experience as the Amy in the article. I left home and went to my friends for exactly the same reasons. The only difference in our stories is that I didn’t have sex or deal in drugs. The same night I left, my parents came and got me. We went to the congregation elders and talked. We are pulling together now, and I know now that my parents are there for me. I know they will understand whatever I have to say to them. If only I had read this article earlier, I would never have run away.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE simple act of speaking​—not necessarily in anger, or fright, but just plain old talking—​seemed to throw a switch that immediately boosted blood pressure,” reports <em>Aviation Safety </em>magazine. It also points out that those who suffer from high blood pressure or are on medication to control it are especially susceptible. In fact, for all persons “the increase in pressure runs anywhere from 10 to 50 percent.” And what was most amazing was that “these same blood pressure relationships held true for deaf people who were doing their speaking via sign language.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This means that, according to the report, even small talk while having a doctor take your blood pressure gives a higher reading. True, such talk “is meant to be friendly and relaxing,” but it ‘actually pushes the pressure dial up.’ On the other hand, “studies show that listening helps lower blood pressure.” Evidently, God’s advice at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:23-20:21:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:23</a> brings not only improved social relationships but also physical benefits.</p>

Listening to the Great Teacher​—Now on Four Cassettes in One Handy Album
Millions of families have enjoyed Listening to the Great Teacher, a book designed for reading with young ones. Its 46 Bible stories fascinate children, while also teaching them high moral standards. Now this valuable 192-page book has been recorded on four cassette tapes. You can listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes and the book Listening to the Great Teacher is only $10. The playing time is a little over 5 hours.
Please send, postpaid, the colorful vinyl album with the four cassette tapes and the book Listening to the Great Teacher. I enclose $10 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for price.)

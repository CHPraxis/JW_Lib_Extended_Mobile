<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Millions of families have enjoyed <em>Listening to the Great Teacher, </em>a book designed for reading with young ones. Its 46 Bible stories fascinate children, while also teaching them high moral standards. Now this valuable 192-page book has been recorded on four cassette tapes. You can listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes and the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher </em>is only $10. The playing time is a little over 5 hours.</p>

Provision for Pioneers
Arrangements have been made for regular and special pioneers to meet with the circuit and district overseers on Friday afternoon of the week of the circuit assembly. This meeting is especially designed to encourage and assist the pioneers in their ministry. Details as to the time and place of the meeting in each circuit will be furnished by the circuit overseer.

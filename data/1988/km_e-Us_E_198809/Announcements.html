<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● We are pleased to announce that a new <em>Cost List </em>has been prepared. Four copies are being sent to each congregation. They should be distributed to the secretary and to the brothers caring for literature, magazines, and accounts.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● It is important that brothers planning charters to visit Brooklyn Bethel or Watchtower Farms first correspond by mail with the office at each location. Please provide information on the number coming and the dates for each location. The Society will provide directions and the route chartered buses should take. Address your mail to the Bethel Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201 and Watchtower Farms, Route 1, Box 300, Wallkill, NY 12589.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Congregation reports should be sent in on time. Even if this means a few reports have to be counted the next month, congregation reports should be sent in by the sixth of the month whenever possible. However, we do NOT require congregations to send reports by express mail if they are a little late in being sent.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● An adjustment is being made in the way the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting are conducted during the visit of the circuit overseer. Starting in September 1988, after the opening song and prayer there should be a half-hour school featuring a ten-minute instruction talk with no review, the Bible highlights, the Bible reading, and one other student talk. That will be followed by a half-hour Service Meeting, which can be adjusted so as to have either three 10-minute parts or two 15-minute parts, with the opening announcements being eliminated. After a song, there will be a half-hour program by the circuit overseer, followed by a concluding song and prayer. The entire program will be one and a half hours, excluding songs and prayers. This arrangement will offer the circuit overseer the opportunity to see how both of these meetings are conducted in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● New Publications Available:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sk"><em>Insight on the Scriptures​</em>—English</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">● Special-Purpose Articles on Drugs: The December 8 issue of <em>Awake! </em>will have a series of articles on the growing menace of drugs. It will show how the problem has developed and what we can do to protect ourselves. This issue should appeal to social and law-enforcement workers, and it would be ideal for youths to place with schoolmates and teachers.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">19. How should we be affected by the details of the temple and the fact that those ministering there had to meet God’s standards?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The many details of the temple, sacrifices, offerings, and festivals should impress us with the need to follow instructions from God’s organization carefully, realizing that every effort should be made to exalt Jehovah and his worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:13-26:45:25" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ezekiel 45:13-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:46:12-26:46:20" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 46:12-20</a>) Those ministering at the temple had to meet God’s high standards, and they were to teach people ‘the difference between holy things and profane things.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:44:15-26:44:16" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ezekiel 44:15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:44:23-26:44:23" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 23</a>) This should move us to maintain holiness as Jehovah’s people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:3-49:1:4" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">20. (a) What is symbolized by the water that flowed from the visionary temple? (b) This symbolic water will have what effect?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>From the temple flowed a stream that healed, or sweetened, the salty waters of the Dead Sea, so that they came to teem with fish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:1-26:47:11" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ezekiel 47:1-11</a>) This water symbolizes God’s provision for life eternal, including Jesus’ sacrifice, which is ample for survivors of Gog’s attack and others, including those resurrected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="56-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> Revelation 22:1, 2</a>) The Dead Sea represents the element in which mankind has existed​—condemnation to inherited sin and death as well as Satan’s rulership. Like the plentiful fish in the sweetened waters of the Dead Sea, redeemed mankind will flourish under the healed circumstances of Messianic rule.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Healing is also associated with trees growing alongside the visionary stream. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:12-26:47:12" data-bid="57-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 47:12</em></a><em>.</em>) In the new world, obedient mankind will enjoy perfect physical and spiritual health. And why not? Leafage of the envisioned fruit trees has continuous healing properties. What blessings for those who know and serve Jehovah!</p>

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">22. What indicates that God will place people where he chooses in Paradise?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>By cooperating with Jehovah’s organization now, we can develop qualities that will make us cooperative when God places people where he chooses in the earthly Paradise. That there will be such placement of people is suggested by the fact that tribal assignments were made north and south of an administrative strip seen by Ezekiel in vision. That three-part “contribution” of land included a section for the nonpriestly Levites and a priestly portion containing the visionary temple. In the center of the southern section was a city with an intertribal work force under a collective “chieftain,” the Messiah’s princely representatives in the “new earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:13-26:48:34" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ezekiel 47:13–48:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:16-19:45:16" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Psalm 45:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">23. To be part of redeemed mankind living in Paradise, what must we do now?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Enthroned in his heavenly sanctuary, God will bless the symbolic city beheld by Ezekiel. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:35-26:48:35" data-bid="59-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 48:35</em></a><em>.</em>) That earthly seat of administration will be named Jehovah-Shammah, or “Jehovah Himself Is There.” Continue to display unfailing love for God, and you can be part of redeemed mankind living in Paradise, when no one on earth will be in spiritual darkness but all will know that Jehovah is the one living and true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:14-35:2:14" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:14</a>) Avoid being forced to acknowledge God’s name against your will when the wicked are destroyed. Exercise faith, showing that you hope to be among the survivors when he fulfills the words: “The nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezekiel 36:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S sword rightly inspires terror in his foes. But when he wielded it against wrongdoers in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, did they really know what was happening?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah’s chariot moved again, and Ezekiel’s location also changed. It was as if God’s chariotlike heavenly organization moved to an observation post above the Mount of Olives. From there Jesus foretold the destruction that came upon Jerusalem in 70 C.E., a devastation <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>prophetic of Christendom’s end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:1-41:13:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 13:1-20</a>) In vision, Ezekiel himself had been taken from the river Chebar, but by God’s spirit he was now brought back to his house of exile in Babylonia. There he told other exiles ‘all that Jehovah had caused him to see.’ Similarly, God’s anointed “watchman” and associated witnesses today declare all that has been revealed to them by the Rider of the celestial chariot.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:22-26:11:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 11:22-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4. How did Jewish exiles respond to Ezekiel’s symbolic acts?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>By symbolic acts, Ezekiel showed Jewish exiles that national disaster was imminent. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:1-26:12:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 12:1-7</em></a><em>.</em>) The prophet carried “luggage for exile” to denote the few items that captives could manage to carry on their shoulders. Horror would soon prevail in besieged Jerusalem. Though many did not take such warnings seriously, Ezekiel was to tell the people: “There will be no postponement anymore.” Today too there is contempt for divine warnings and prophecies, but we can do much to help truth-seekers to place confidence in their fulfillment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:8-26:12:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezekiel 12:8-28</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Those not listening to Jehovah’s watchman needed to know that they would feel God’s “sword.” So, those responsible for misconceptions about the security of Jerusalem and Judah were denounced. False prophets were compared to destructive foxes, and it was shown that liars were whitewashing the tottering walls, or vain projects, of the people. False prophetesses were denounced too. “The day of Jehovah” was imminent, and his face was set against those ‘withdrawing from him,’ that is, ‘dedicating themselves away from following God.’ If we are dedicated to Jehovah, surely we would never want to withdraw from his sacred service.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:13:1-26:14:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezekiel 13:1–14:11</a>.</p>

Not even righteous Noah, Daniel, and Job could deliver them when God brought his judgments upon the land.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Because of her unfaithful inhabitants, Judah was likened to a wild vine without good fruit and fit only for the fire. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:15:1-26:15:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a>) She was also likened to a foundling saved by God from Egypt and nurtured to womanhood. Jehovah took her as his wife, but she turned to false gods and would suffer destruction for her spiritual adultery. Yet, with faithful ones God would ‘establish an indefinitely lasting covenant’​—the new covenant with spiritual Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:1-26:16:63" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 16:1-63;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 31:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Galatians 6:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Next, the rulers of Babylon and Egypt were likened to great eagles. One broke off the top of a cedar tree by removing King Jehoiachin and replacing him with Zedekiah. Although Zedekiah took a loyalty oath to Nebuchadnezzar, he broke it, seeking the military help of Egypt’s ruler, the other great eagle. If Zedekiah invoked God’s name in taking his oath, breaking it brought reproach on Jehovah. The very thought of bringing reproach on God should restrain us from ever proving false to our word. Privileged we are indeed to bear the divine name as Jehovah’s Witnesses!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:1-26:17:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:1-21</a>.</p>

Planted by Jehovah on heavenly Mount Zion, he would become “a majestic cedar,” a source of protection and blessing as he ruled over the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1</a>) In this we can indeed take heart.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>If we are to benefit from the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy, however, we must maintain a good relationship with Jehovah. Ezekiel’s fellow exiles apparently thought that they had a fine standing with God and blamed their forebears for their sufferings. But the prophet pointed out that each person is responsible for the consequences of his own conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:1-26:18:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:1-29</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:28-24:31:30" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:28-30</a>.)

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>In a dirge over Judah’s fall, her rulers were compared to young lions. King Jehoahaz died in Egyptian exile, Jehoiakim was captured by Nebuchadnezzar, and Jehoiachin was exiled to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar next placed Zedekiah on Judah’s throne, but he revolted. Ultimately, like a caged lion, Zedekiah was carried captive to Babylon. In keeping with the prophetic dirge, in 607 B.C.E., Judah became a ruined vine, “and there proved to be in her no strong rod, no scepter for ruling.” She had been struck by Jehovah’s “sword”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:19:1-26:19:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezekiel 19:1-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:39:1-24:39:7" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 39:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><sup>12 </sup>Approached by “men from the elderly ones of Israel,” Ezekiel spoke God’s message. He pointed out that although Jehovah delivered the Israelites from Egypt and gave them His Law, they rejected it and practiced idolatry. Since Ezekiel’s contemporaries were guilty of similar wrongdoing, God would put himself on judgment against them. Apparently with skepticism and not because they did not understand what Ezekiel meant, the people asked: “Is he not composing proverbial sayings?” They would soon learn that there was nothing merely proverbial about the prophet’s message. This should warn us never to adopt a skeptical attitude toward the fulfillment of Scriptural warnings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:1-26:20:49" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezekiel 20:1-49</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>In the seventh year of the exile (by Ab 10, 611 B.C.E.), less than two and a half years remained before “the battle in the day of Jehovah” was to begin against Judah and Jerusalem.

Self-assured ones of Ezekiel’s day had no reason to exult, concluding that Jehovah’s “sword” would not ‘organize a slaughter’ against them. That “sword” rejected the royal scepter of the kingdom of Judah, even as it rejected every other “tree,” or scepter.

From a container Nebuchadnezzar would choose an arrow marked for Jerusalem. He would use teraphim (likely, small idols in human form) and would look for indications in the liver of a slain animal. Despite divination, however, he would take the road to the Judean capital and besiege it. True, Nebuchadnezzar had concluded a covenant with King Zedekiah. But because of their oath-breaking, Zedekiah and other Jews would be “seized even by the hand” and led captive to Babylon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:23-26:21:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:23, 24</a>.</p>

Jehovah had judged Jerusalem according to her wicked dealings, and she had to be destroyed, even as Christendom must be.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:1-26:24:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezekiel 24:1-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">24. (a) Why did Ezekiel display no grief when his wife died? (b) When Jehovah’s “sword” descends upon her, how will Christendom react, and what will she come to know?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Next, Ezekiel was to act in an unusual way. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:15-26:24:18" data-bid="40-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 24:15-18</em></a><em>.</em>) Why was the prophet to display no grief when his wife died? To show how stunned the Jews would be at the destruction of Jerusalem, her inhabitants, and the temple. Ezekiel had already said enough about such matters and would not speak God’s message again until Jerusalem’s downfall was reported to him. Similarly, Christendom and her hypocritical religionists will be stunned at the time of their destruction. And after the “great tribulation” begins, what the anointed watchman class had already said about her end will be enough. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>) But when God’s “sword” descends upon Christendom, such stunned religionists and others ‘will have to know that he is Jehovah.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:19-26:24:27" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ezekiel 24:19-27</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>On Tammuz 5, 613 B.C.E. (in the fifth year of Judean king Jehoiachin’s exile in Babylon), the 30-year-old priest Ezekiel was among Jewish captives by “the river Chebar,” a notable canal of the Euphrates River. In vision, he beheld Jehovah’s celestial chariot, attended by “four living creatures.” (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:4-26:1:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 1:4-10</em></a><em>.</em>) Each ‘living creature,’ or winged cherub, had four faces.

Each cherub stood beside a huge ‘wheel within a wheel,’ and God’s spirit, or active force, was able to move them in any direction.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:1-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5. What does the celestial chariot represent, and how should this view of it affect Jehovah’s people?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The chariot Rider was a glorious representation of Jehovah. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:22-26:1:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 1:22-28</em></a><em>.</em>) How well the chariot represents God’s angelic spirit organization!

The Rider was calm, like the accompanying rainbow, but Ezekiel was overwhelmed. Surely, this awesome view of Jehovah’s glory and power as the Supreme Organizer of his heavenly hosts should make us humbly grateful for the privilege of serving him as part of his earthly organization.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. (a) What appointment did Ezekiel receive, and how did he view service to God? (b) Among people of what kind was Ezekiel to prophesy, and of what benefit is it to know how God dealt with him?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Though reminded of his human origin and lowly estate by being called “son of man,” Ezekiel was appointed as Jehovah’s prophet. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:2:1-26:2:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 2:1</em><em>-5</em></a><em>.</em>) Ezekiel would go to “rebellious nations,” the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. First, by divine command he ate a scroll containing dirges, but it tasted like honey because he was grateful to be God’s prophet. Similarly, anointed Christians and their fellow servants find it sweet to be witnesses of Jehovah. Ezekiel was to prophesy among hardhearted and hardheaded people, but God would make his face as determined as their faces, his forehead as hard as a diamond. He would prophesy boldly whether they listened or not. It is heartening to know that as God upheld Ezekiel in difficult circumstances, He will help us to bear witness courageously in any territory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:2:6-26:3:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 2:6–3:11</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:12-26:3:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 3:12-15</a>) We too need to meditate and study diligently to comprehend deep spiritual things. Having a message to declare, Ezekiel was commissioned as God’s watchman. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:16-26:3:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 3:16-21</em></a><em>.</em>) The newly appointed watchman was to warn lawbreaking Israelites that they faced divine execution.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. Who serve as Jehovah’s “watchman” today, and who are associated with them?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>If Ezekiel failed as a watchman, Jehovah would hold him responsible for the deaths of victims. Although those not wanting him to administer reproof would put figurative cords upon him, he would boldly declare God’s message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:22-26:3:27" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 3:22-27</a>) In our day, Christendom refuses to listen and tries to impose restraints upon anointed Christians. But since 1919 these anointed ones have served as Jehovah’s “watchman,” courageously declaring his message for this system’s “time of the end.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 12:4</a>) Associated with them in this work is an increasing “great crowd” of Jesus’ “other sheep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) Since the “watchman” class keeps speaking God’s message, surely every one of the anointed and the “great crowd” would want to declare it as a regular publisher.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Ezekiel next enacted prophetic pantomimes with humility and boldness, setting an example that should move us to carry out God-given assignments humbly and courageously. To depict the Babylonian siege, he was to lie down facing a brick on which he had engraved a picture of Jerusalem. Ezekiel was to lie on his left side for 390 days to bear the error of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, then on his right side for 40 days to carry the sin of two-tribe Judah. A day stood for a year. So the 390 years ran from the founding of Israel in 997 B.C.E. to the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. Judah’s 40 years ran from Jeremiah’s appointment as God’s prophet in 647 B.C.E. to Judah’s desolation in 607 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:1-26:4:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:1-24:1:3" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 1:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Ezekiel next enacted the effects of the siege. To denote famine, he subsisted on just over eight ounces <strong>[0.2 kg] </strong>of food and about a pint <strong>[0.5 L] </strong>of water a day. His bread (an unlawful mixture of wheat, barley, broad beans, lentils, millet, and spelt baked over dung) was unclean. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:19-3:19:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:19</a>) This action showed that Jerusalem’s residents would suffer great privation. But how heartening it is to know that just as Jehovah sustained Ezekiel under difficult circumstances, God will help us to remain faithful and fulfill our preaching commission in the face of all hardships!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:9-26:4:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:9-17</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:5-26:5:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezekiel 5:5-17</a>) The fact that Jehovah fulfilled this and the other prophetic enactments should move us to trust in him as the Fulfiller of prophecy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:9-23:42:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 55:11</a>.</p>

The very thought of devastation by famine, pestilence, and warfare would make one cry “Alas!” and emphasize this by clapping the hands and stamping the foot. Dead bodies of spiritual fornicators would litter the high places.

Those belonging to Judah’s “crowd” of buyers and sellers would be either killed or taken into exile, and the hands of any who managed to stay alive would drop from faintness.

Jehovah ‘caused the pride of the strong ones to cease’ when King Zedekiah was captured and chief ones of the Levitical priesthood were killed.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:1-26:11:13" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezekiel 11:1-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:1-2:19:8" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Exodus 19:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:1-2:24:7" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 24:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:24-24:52:27" data-bid="40-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 52:24-27</a>) Because Christendom claims to be in a covenant with God but puts confidence in worldly alliances, she will perish under assault by Jehovah’s executional forces.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">21. What happened after Judah’s 70-year desolation, and what comparable development affected the anointed remnant?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Though Israelites had been ‘scattered among the lands,’ as in 617 B.C.E., God was “a sanctuary,” or refuge, for repentant exiles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:14-26:11:16" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ezekiel 11:14-16</a>) But what else could be expected? (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:17-26:11:21" data-bid="42-1" class="b"><em>Ezekiel 11:17-21</em></a><em>.</em>) After Judah’s 70-year desolation, a remnant was restored to the cleansed “soil of Israel.” Comparably, after a Babylonish captivity, the anointed remnant was delivered in 1919, and under the guidance of God’s spirit, the once desolate “soil” of spiritual Israel has been cleansed. Hence, those ‘marked’ for preservation are now enjoying divine favor along with the restored remnant of spiritual Israel. And if you keep on listening to God’s “watchman,” you may be among the survivors when Jehovah unsheathes his sword.</p>

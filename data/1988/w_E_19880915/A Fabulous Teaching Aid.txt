A Fabulous Teaching Aid
A YOUNG child can remember more than you think. In a letter of thanks for the cassette tapes for My Book of Bible Stories, a mother from Florida (U.S.A.) writes about her five-year-old son:
“If you ask him just by number, he knows what the story is about. He doesn’t read yet but has memorized the stories and can say them by heart. People have told me their kids won’t go to sleep without a blanket or toys. Mine can’t go to sleep without his tape player on. He listens to the stories all the time. He falls asleep every night listening to them. Here is a picture of him while listening to them.”
Listening to the cassettes of the 116 stories in My Book of Bible Stories will help young ones learn what the Bible is all about. Are you using this fine teaching aid? The album with the four cassettes is only $8; playing time five and a half hours.
Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for price.)

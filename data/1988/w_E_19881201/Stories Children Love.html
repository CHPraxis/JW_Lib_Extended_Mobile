<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LAST year the Watch Tower Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn received the following letter from Sherwood, Oregon:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Sirs:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I recently checked a book out from the library entitled <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>for my 4- and 6-year-olds. The stories are told in such a way that they can comprehend, and they have thoroughly enjoyed reading the stories of the Bible. We would like to add this book to our personal library.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“At the back of the book it says that a copy may be obtained by writing this address and sending $2.00. The book looks like it has been in print for some time. Can you tell me the current cost so I may send payment and receive the book?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At its release in 1978, <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>was $2, but now the contribution is $3. You too may receive a copy of this beautifully illustrated, large-print, 256-page publication by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with $3.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the hardbound book <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>for which I enclose $3 (U.S.).</p>

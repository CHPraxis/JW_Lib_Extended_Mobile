Stories Children Love
LAST year the Watch Tower Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn received the following letter from Sherwood, Oregon:
“Sirs:
“I recently checked a book out from the library entitled My Book of Bible Stories for my 4- and 6-year-olds. The stories are told in such a way that they can comprehend, and they have thoroughly enjoyed reading the stories of the Bible. We would like to add this book to our personal library.”
“At the back of the book it says that a copy may be obtained by writing this address and sending $2.00. The book looks like it has been in print for some time. Can you tell me the current cost so I may send payment and receive the book?”
At its release in 1978, My Book of Bible Stories was $2, but now the contribution is $3. You too may receive a copy of this beautifully illustrated, large-print, 256-page publication by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with $3.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound book My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $3 (U.S.).

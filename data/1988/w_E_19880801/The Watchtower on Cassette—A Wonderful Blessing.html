<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what ever so many people have been saying. A traveling insurance salesman in California observes: “I am on the highway traveling very often. I use the car cassette system to play the tapes and have been able to listen to <em>The Watchtower, </em>each issue, many times to gain a wealth of spiritual food.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another letter, from California, explains: “Truly these tapes are a joy to me, and I know that they are a gift from the true God, Jehovah. I just love them and use every opportunity to listen. I feel that I am putting valuable information in my head instead of junk. Truly a mere ‘thank you’ does not fully express how having these tapes makes me feel.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A writer from Utah says: “While they cannot fully replace intense reading and rereading of the articles, their aid in ‘sounding’ down the truth cannot be overlooked. Now my wife and I can listen quietly at home or while we are in the car.”</p>

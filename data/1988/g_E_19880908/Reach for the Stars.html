<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">YELLOW dwarfs, red supergiants, hot blue stars, all conjure up visions of a celestial kaleidoscope. But, apart from their brightness, most of us find it hard to detect any difference between one star and another. What do the astronomers see that we don’t?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Even a medium-sized telescope hardly reveals their color. Nevertheless, the color is there. As the Bible said some two thousand years ago, “star differs from star in glory” and, of course, color.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:41-46:15:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So why can’t we see the diverse colors of the stars? Although our eyes get accustomed to the dark after a few minutes, they require a certain minimum intensity of light to perceive color, and starlight is not that strong. Thus, while we can see faraway objects, we still find it difficult to distinguish their color.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The astronomer gets around this problem by using sensitive photographic plates together with powerful telescopes. The time-lapse photograph at the right shows clearly the different colors of certain stars in the Southern Hemisphere as they move across the night sky. What a beautiful testimony to the handiwork of God!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:3-19:8:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3</a>.</p>

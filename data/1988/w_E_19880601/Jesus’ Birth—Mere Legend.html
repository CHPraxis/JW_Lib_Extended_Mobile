<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE birth of Christ! It is claimed to be the basis for Christendom’s biggest yearly celebration. Ironically, though, many clergymen brush off various aspects of the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ birth as mere legend. <em>The Interpreter’s Bible, </em>for example, says of Matthew’s account of the visit of the astrologers, or “wise men”: “There is thus no way to ascertain whether it has been embellished, or indeed, whether it ‘happened’ at all as a matter of literal fact. The value and importance of the narrative do not depend on its accuracy; the story is rather to be thought of as a work of art.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Such critics often argue that the Gospel accounts of Christ’s birth are too lacking in detail to be viewed as historical. But in his book <em>The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, </em>Alfred Edersheim rebuts this, saying: “It may safely be asserted, that no Apocryphal or legendary narrative of such a (legendary) event would have been characterised by such scantiness, or rather absence, of details. For, the two essential features, alike of legend and of tradition, are, that they ever seek to surround their heroes with a halo of glory, and that they attempt to supply details, which are otherwise wanting.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why, though, do the Gospels provide so few details regarding the birth of Jesus? Primarily because his <em>death, </em>not his birth, is of major importance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) Edersheim further reminds us: “The Gospels were not intended to furnish a biography of Jesus, nor even the materials for it; but had only this twofold object: that those who read them ‘might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,’ and that believing they ‘might have life through His Name.’”</p>

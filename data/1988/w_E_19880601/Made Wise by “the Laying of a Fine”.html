<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:11-20:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PROVERBS 21:11</a> says: “By the laying of a fine on the ridiculer the inexperienced becomes wise; and by one’s giving insight to a wise person he gets knowledge.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An “inexperienced” one often has difficulty appreciating why a certain course of conduct is wrong. In time, though, he may observe a “ridiculer”​—one who scoffs at the principles of God’s Word—​become caught in his wickedness and suffer “distress and hard times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:27-20:1:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:27</a>) Under the Mosaic Law, appropriate ‘punishment’ (<em>King James Version</em>), or more literally “a fine,” could have been levied on the wrongdoer.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 21:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:19-5:22:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 22:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The effect on the inexperienced one? Finally seeing the reward of wrongdoing, he could ‘become wise’ and determine not to follow such a course himself. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:25-20:19:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:25</a>.) By way of contrast, “a wise person” already knows from past experience, observation, and knowledge of Bible principles that a certain course of conduct is unwholesome or destructive. He does not always need to observe the ruinous outcome of a certain act to be convinced of its wrongfulness. He can thus gain new ‘insights’ by mere instruction, rather than by bitter experience.</p>

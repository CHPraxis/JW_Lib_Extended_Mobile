<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Justice for All by God’s Appointed Judge</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Governments have long sought to achieve ‘Justice for All,’ as did the ancient Greeks whose judges heard crucial law cases on this Areopagus, or Mars’ Hill. At this court of justice over 1,900 years ago, a man indicated how true justice for all will be realized. His speech will be examined closely in the principal talk of this summer’s “Divine Justice” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You can hear this talk at any one of more than a hundred such conventions being held this summer in the United States, the British Isles, and Canada. The convention program also features helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life, and two instructive Bible dramas.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses for the location of the convention nearest you, or write the publishers of this magazine. In the United States, the talk will be given on Sunday at 2:00 p.m.</p>

● Should pioneers obtain literature for family members at pioneer rates?
It is good to keep in mind why the Society makes it possible for pioneers to obtain literature at a reduced cost. This is a loving provision of the Society, at its expense, to help pioneers defray some of their expenses.
Accordingly, all publishers who are members of a pioneer’s household and who are not pioneers, whether children or adults, should obtain their literature and magazines for field service at the regular publisher rates.

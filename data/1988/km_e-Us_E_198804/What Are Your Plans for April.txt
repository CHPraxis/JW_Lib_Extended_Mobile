What Are Your Plans for April?
1 The month of April begins a period of increased field service activity for many of us. In some areas the weather has moderated and is more favorable for staying out in the field service for longer periods of time. April usually proves to be an ideal month for setting personal goals of increased activity in the ministry.
2 What field service arrangements has your congregation made for April? Will there be additional meetings for field service, including evening witnessing? Will you be able to adjust your schedule so as to take advantage of these arrangements and work with others in the field service? Can you temporarily set aside other activity that is less important?
3 In addition to making calls on those who attend the Memorial, April would also be a good time for a renewed effort to locate interested persons who have been too busy to talk with you during the winter holiday season or who were not at home when you called. Although you may have already made several attempts to give a further witness, why not look through your records and call on these individuals again in an endeavor to renew their interest in the good news? Perhaps evening calls would be productive.
4 Many brothers and sisters have arranged to auxiliary pioneer this April. These include some with family responsibilities and even some with full-time secular jobs. The 60-hour requirement means an average of only 2 hours per day for the month.
5 If circumstances do not allow you to auxiliary pioneer during April, it may be possible for you to increase your field service activity by spending some time in the field with the pioneers or with others who are also endeavoring to increase their ministry for the month. You can be assured that Jehovah will bless your efforts. By his spirit he will give you strength to reach your goal.​—Prov. 20:18; 21:5a.

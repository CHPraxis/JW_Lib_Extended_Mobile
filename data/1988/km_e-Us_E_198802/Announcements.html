<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The Memorial celebration will be held Friday, April 1, 1988. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No other meetings are to be conducted on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Friday, you may want to switch those to another time of the week if the hall is available. If your Service Meeting is affected, it may be possible to incorporate into another Service Meeting any parts scheduled for that week that are particularly applicable to your congregation.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter recently received by the German branch office of the Watch Tower Society reads, in part:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Diana is seven years old and has suffered from spastic paralysis from birth. Since she must attend a specialized school many miles from home, she must go to bed evenings at seven o’clock so that she can be up by six the next morning. She was always afraid of being alone in her room. So we put a cassette recorder there and at first played music cassettes, but this did not help. Besides, I wanted her to listen to something educational that she could understand.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Then a wonderful solution came along​—the cassette recordings of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I got them for her, and suddenly Diana was no longer afraid. She has learned ten of the stories by heart​—word for word—​and knows the others well enough to detect any mistake you may make in reading them to her, even though she herself cannot read yet. Since learning story 69, ‘A Girl Helps a Mighty Man,’ she has been talking to her teachers and to the children at school about the stories she knows.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Might these cassettes, along with the beautifully illustrated publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>be a welcome addition to your child’s library? What child would not be thrilled to have such a storyteller ready to read to him day or night? These cassettes, as well as the book, can be ordered by filling in and mailing the coupon below.</p>

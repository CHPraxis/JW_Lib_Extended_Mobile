The Universe​—Creation or Chance Event?
IN THE continuing debate on whether the universe was created or came about by chance, the following comments by Paul Davies, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Newcastle in Great Britain, in his book God and the New Physics are very thought provoking:
“If the universe is simply an accident, the odds against it containing any appreciable order are ludicrously small. . . . As this was clearly not the case, it appears hard to escape the conclusion that the actual state of the universe has been ‘chosen’ or selected somehow from the huge number of available states, all but an infinitesimal fraction of which are totally disordered. And if such an exceedingly improbable initial state was selected, there surely had to be a selector or designer to ‘choose’ it.”
Truly, just as a builder selects a design and the materials to construct something to serve his purpose, so the almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, created the universe. (Psalm 83:18; Revelation 4:11) Indeed, Professor Davies’ conclusion reminds us of the apostle Paul’s words at Hebrews 3:4: “He that constructed all things is God.”

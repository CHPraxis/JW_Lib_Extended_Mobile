To Cope With Life’s Difficulties
Last year the house of a schoolteacher in Bignona, Senegal, burned down. Afterward, the branch of the Watch Tower Society in that West African country received this letter:
“What upsets me so much,” the schoolteacher explained, “is that in the fire I lost books that are of inestimable value to me. The titles include Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It and Is This Life All There Is? I can get by all right without my clothes and my house, but I can’t get by without those books! They are more important to me than all else I lost. I beg you, please contact me as soon as possible, and let me know how I can get replacement copies. Life is full of difficulties, and we need such information to solve them and help us make right decisions and conduct ourselves properly.”
Many others feel the same way about these two publications. In fact, over 22 million copies of the Youth book and over 20 million copies of Is This Life All There Is? have been distributed worldwide. You can receive these two vital books by simply filling in and mailing the coupon along with $2.
Please send, postpaid, the two 192-page, hardcover books Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It and Is This Life All There Is? I enclose $2 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year the house of a schoolteacher in Bignona, Senegal, burned down. Afterward, the branch of the Watch Tower Society in that West African country received this letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“What upsets me so much,” the schoolteacher explained, “is that in the fire I lost books that are of inestimable value to me. The titles include <em>Your Youth​</em>—<em>Getting the Best out of It </em>and <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>I can get by all right without my clothes and my house, but I can’t get by without those books! They are more important to me than all else I lost. I beg you, please contact me as soon as possible, and let me know how I can get replacement copies. Life is full of difficulties, and we need such information to solve them and help us make right decisions and conduct ourselves properly.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many others feel the same way about these two publications. In fact, over 22 million copies of the <em>Youth </em>book and over 20 million copies of <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>have been distributed worldwide. You can receive these two vital books by simply filling in and mailing the coupon along with $2.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the two 192-page, hardcover books <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>and <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>I enclose $2 (U.S.).</p>

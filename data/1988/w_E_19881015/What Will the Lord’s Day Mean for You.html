<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">BACK in 1914, Jesus was installed as King of God’s Kingdom, and the Lord’s day began. Immediately, the new King faced violent opposition from Satan the Devil and his agents here on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:1-19:2:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1-6</a>) So these early years of the Lord’s day have been a time of conflict in which Jesus has gone ‘subduing in the midst of his enemies.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:2-19:110:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The new King’s conquests have been impressive. After 1914, Satan tried to “devour” the newborn Kingdom but, instead, was ignominiously cast out of heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-12</a>) He then ‘waged war’ with the remaining ones of the anointed, but he was unable to prevent their ‘standing up’ in 1919 or their accepting “the little scroll” from the hand of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:8-66:10:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 10:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:11-66:11:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 11:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 12:17</a>) He was equally powerless to prevent the gathering of the final ones of the 144,000 and the assembling of the great crowd (out of all the nations), who render “sacred service day and night in <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>[Jehovah’s] temple.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 9-15</a>.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. How is false religion described in Revelation?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The destruction of Satan’s world begins with the end of false religion. Revelation describes the whole world empire of false religion​—including Christendom—​as a prostitute, Babylon the Great, who has relations with the kings of the earth and makes mankind drunk with her fornication. She herself is also drunk​—revoltingly—​from drinking blood, the blood of God’s servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1-6</a>) Revelation also describes the end of this disgusting old harlot, and we can better understand what this will mean if we consider what happened to another religious harlot that existed back in the seventh century before our Common Era.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5, 6. Why was unfaithful Jerusalem called a prostitute, and what judgment did this bring on her from the hand of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>That harlot was the city of Jerusalem. She was supposed to be the center of Jehovah’s worship on earth, but God said to her: “By your blood that you have shed you have become guilty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:4-26:22:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 22:4</a>) She was also supposed to be spiritually pure, but she had prostituted herself by consorting with the nations. “O how I am filled up with rage against you,” Jehovah said to her, “by your doing all these things, the work of a woman, a domineering prostitute!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:30-26:16:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 16:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:1-26:23:21" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 23:1-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> James 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Consider, then, Jehovah’s judgment on this harlot: “Here I am collecting together all those [the nations] passionately loving you toward whom you were pleasurable and all those whom you loved . . . , and they must strip you of your garments and take your beautiful articles and leave you behind naked and nude. And they must burn your houses with fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:37-26:16:37" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 16:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:39-26:16:39" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 39,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:41-26:16:41" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:25-26:23:30" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 23:25-30</a>) History records what happened.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Something similar will happen to Babylon the Great.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 8. What kind of time will the great tribulation be for mankind?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>With the destruction of Babylon the Great, we will have entered the “great tribulation” prophesied by Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:14</a>) Speaking of that time, Revelation says: “A great earthquake occurred; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the entire moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell to the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:12-66:6:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 6:12, 13</a>) This great earthquake is the “great quaking” in “the soil of Israel” that Ezekiel prophesied. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:18-26:38:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:14-29:3:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Joel 3:14-16</a>) It is the final destruction of this wicked system of things. Will anything happen to the literal sun, moon, and stars at that time?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9, 10. What did Ezekiel prophesy in the case of Egypt, and how was this fulfilled?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Ezekiel, warning of the coming fall of Israel’s large southern neighbor, Egypt, said: “‘And when you [Pharaoh] get extinguished I will cover the heavens and darken their stars. As for the sun, with clouds I shall cover it, and the moon itself will not let its light shine. All the luminaries of light in the heavens​—I shall darken them on your account, and I will put darkness upon your land,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:7-26:32:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezekiel 32:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>When Pharaoh and his armies fell, the literal heavens did not darken. But Egypt’s future became very dark. As Bible scholar C. F. Keil notes, “the darkness consequent [upon Pharaoh’s fall] is a figurative representation of utterly hopeless circumstances.” Forever finished as an independent world power, Egypt was dominated by one world power after another! Today, most of the territory of the ancient Pharaonic world power is ruled by an Arab nation.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11. (a) What is prefigured by what happened to Egypt? (b) How will the future be absolutely black for Satan’s world at the great tribulation?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>But Keil saw a further meaning in Ezekiel’s prophecy. He writes: “The overthrow of this world-power [Egypt] is an omen and prelude of the overthrow of every ungodly world-power on the day of the last judgment.” This is, in substance, true. As Revelation shows, at the great tribulation ungodly mankind’s prospects will be as black as were those of Egypt. It will be as if the sun gave no light by day and the night sky were devoid of any warm light from the moon and without any friendly, twinkling stars. Those who refuse to honor Jehovah’s King will perish without even an honorable burial as the Rider on the white horse completes his conquest.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>What, though, of Christians in these <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>times? Well, they have been greatly affected by the ceaseless warfare between Satan and the Rider on the white horse. Since Satan has been unable to get at Jesus personally, he has unleashed the full force of his fury on the remaining ones of the anointed and​—more recently—​on the great crowd of other sheep that has gathered around them. As Jesus warned, these have been “objects of hatred by all the nations on account of [his] name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:9</a>) Satan has used every weapon at his disposal, including mobbing, imprisonment, torture, and murder, to fight against them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Satan has also skillfully used guile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:11</a>) Using “the deceptive power of riches,” he has tempted some to slow down or even to cease their sacred service.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Hence, Christians have needed to cultivate endurance during the Lord’s day. Some have failed, and each failure has been a small victory for Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) But most have heeded Jesus’ promise: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 24:13</a>) With help from Jehovah, they have conquered and brought joy to his heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:13-62:2:14" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:13, 14</a>.</p>

He wanted to write down what he had heard, but he reports: “I heard a voice out of heaven say: ‘Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.’” Evidently, it was not yet time for such information to be released. Instead, John was told to take the little scroll and eat it. The seven thunders appear to represent a complete expression of Jehovah’s purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:29:3-19:29:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 29:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:28-43:12:29" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> John 12:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:5-66:4:5" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Revelation 4:5</a>) Back in 1919, when anointed Christians figuratively ate the little scroll, it was not time for them to have a complete understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:8-27:12:9" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Daniel 12:8, 9</a>.)

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Then, over the years, they were given a progressively clearer understanding of Jehovah’s will.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>At the same time, Jehovah entrusted his earthly servants with outstanding privileges of service.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>At the end of the thousand years, mankind will have been raised to perfection. What an appropriate time for Satan to make his final appearance on the earthly scene! Once again he will try to deceive mankind, and some will follow him, even then. These are significantly called “Gog and Magog” since they will manifest the same evil spirit as that shown by ‘Gog’s crowd’ in Ezekiel’s prophecy. But their rebellious spirit will be wiped out for all eternity when they, along with Satan himself and his demons, are cast into the symbolic lake of fire.

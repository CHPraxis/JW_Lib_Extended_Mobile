<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you feel that this is what you are doing?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many people do. And they are helped by knowing how others cope. A card from Greenville, Texas, addressed to the Watchtower Society, explained: “I truly appreciate the true life stories of Christian persons who have endured much suffering in order to be faithful. Many were the experiences I read with tears streaming down my face, as I could see that only Jehovah the true God was able to deliver them out of such a dilemma as the ones they were in. It makes me a more humble and thankful Christian as I read what they went through, and it helped me <em>not </em>to think too much of myself or be selfish.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>is filled with experiences of Christians standing firm for righteousness during the war in Korea and during the years of terrorism in Ireland. The <em>Yearbook </em>also provides a historical account of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Costa Rica, as well as an up-to-date picture of their work worldwide.</p>

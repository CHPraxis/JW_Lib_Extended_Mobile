Bearing Up Under Superhuman Pressure
Do you feel that this is what you are doing?
Many people do. And they are helped by knowing how others cope. A card from Greenville, Texas, addressed to the Watchtower Society, explained: “I truly appreciate the true life stories of Christian persons who have endured much suffering in order to be faithful. Many were the experiences I read with tears streaming down my face, as I could see that only Jehovah the true God was able to deliver them out of such a dilemma as the ones they were in. It makes me a more humble and thankful Christian as I read what they went through, and it helped me not to think too much of myself or be selfish.”
The 1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses is filled with experiences of Christians standing firm for righteousness during the war in Korea and during the years of terrorism in Ireland. The Yearbook also provides a historical account of the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Costa Rica, as well as an up-to-date picture of their work worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1988 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

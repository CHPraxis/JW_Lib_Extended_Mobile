A New Feature of the 1989 Calendar
1 For six years we have enjoyed calendars with colorful scenes of our brothers witnessing in various lands. But for the year just ahead, we will have a new type of calendar from which you will benefit in a different way.
2 The 1989 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses will present a series of beautiful color photographs of locations in the Promised Land. Under each large picture will be interesting comments on what we see in the photograph. There will also be details about Biblical events occurring at that location or remarks showing why the place is important to us as keen students of God’s Word.
3 Of course, the calendar will continue to have the useful features that we have long appreciated, such as the schedule for Bible reading. But you will likely find new uses because of the large, clear pictures of the Promised Land. For example, January/​February will show an aerial view of Megiddo, which you could use on a Bible study to explain the meaning of Armageddon. The pictures will help us to visualize Bible accounts, so parents will probably use them in discussing Bible stories with their children.
4 The photographs and comments will be numbered so that a particular one can be identified easily if you are discussing a Bible account during a meeting part. Some may want to get an extra calendar and frame the pictures or put them in a binder for permanent use. These pictures should be a valuable addition to your theocratic library. Please consider this when placing your order.

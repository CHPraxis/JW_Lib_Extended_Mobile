<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● During the week of August 29–September 3, 1988, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature orders will be processed for shipment or for pickup during that week.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms and should take an actual count of campaign literature. Please fill out the forms completely and send the original to us no later than September 6, 1988. Keep a carbon copy for your files. We are sending the third copy for use as a work sheet.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Congregations should begin ordering the 1989 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature order. (See the 1988 <em>Cost List, </em>paragraphs 7-10.) The calendars will be available in Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Calendars are controlled stock items and will be charged to the literature account at $1.00 each, which is the rate for publishers, pioneers, and the public.

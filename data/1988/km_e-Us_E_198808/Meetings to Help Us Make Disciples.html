(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>) Our progress as a Christian minister depends to a great extent on <em>how </em>we listen at meetings, at assemblies, and to elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:15-20:18:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 18:15</a>) A good listener not only hears with his ears but also pays attention with his mind and his heart. He is moved by his heart to get the sense of a matter and do something about it. He is <em>motivated </em>by what he hears. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>) <em>Interest </em>is a very important factor in good listening. Our interest in the truth should help us to improve our listening habits at meetings and assemblies. What can we do to improve our listening habits? See Study 5 of the <em>School Guidebook </em>for additional suggestions. Encourage all to remember Jesus’ counsel, “Pay attention to how you listen.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:18-42:8:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 8:18</a>.</p>

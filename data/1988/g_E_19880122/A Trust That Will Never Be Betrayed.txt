A Trust That Will Never Be Betrayed
“TRUST thyself only, and another shall not betray thee.” Although this cynical observation was made 250 years ago, many today express similar sentiments. A spirit of mistrust permeates society.
Leo, who plans to remarry, insists that before the wedding his fiancée sign an agreement outlining alimony benefits in the event of a future divorce. Marriage is no longer equated with trust.
Larry, typical of many unemployed youths, complains: “When society knows that it can take you, put you in a little hole and leave you there, that’s what they do.” He has lost confidence in society in general.
After a recent scandal involving a prominent television evangelist, Juanita, a former monetary contributor, lamented: “It’s a deception, that whole thing.” Even religious leaders are not always trustworthy.
Wisely, the Bible warns against naively trusting in humans and human institutions. The psalmist writes: “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man.” The same psalm, however, does advise us to rely on someone, someone who will never betray a trust, the almighty God.​—Psalm 146:3, 5.
True, national leaders, even entire nations, frequently profess to put their trust in God. In fact, many United States bills and coins for the last hundred years have borne the motto: “IN GOD WE TRUST.” But history indicates that rather than trust in God, mankind in general has put its faith in economic, military, and political might.
Can a people that really does put trust in God be found today? Is it worth their while to do so? How does it benefit them?
During the summer of 1987, in hundreds of cities throughout the northern hemisphere, millions convened to reaffirm their trust in God. The theme of their conventions, organized by Jehovah’s Witnesses, was: “Trust in Jehovah.” As a newspaper in Norwich, England, observed, this year’s convention theme reflected the prevailing mood of disenchantment with the world. But rather than bemoaning the failure of human institutions, the Witnesses assembled to consider ways in which they could strengthen their reliance on Jehovah and to review the benefits that such a course brings.
What drew these people together? Their trust in God and in his Word, the Bible. A newspaper article in Granada, Spain, explained their motive for attending the convention: “Entire families have traveled to Granada, young children, parents and grandparents, in order to listen to the word of Jehovah, because that is what the Bible counsels. This serves to unite families and to strengthen bonds of friendship.”
Trust in God Manifested by Those Who Attended
For many, just being at a convention was an evidence of their reliance on Jehovah. This was true in the case of Simone Grijmonprez, who was at the convention in Kortrijk, Belgium, each day despite a grave illness that requires her to be on oxygen for six hours daily.
Present at the convention in El Ferrol, Spain, was Roberto González who is a quadriplegic and also a full-time minister. Despite being confined to a wheelchair and having to be bedridden for two or three months every year, he spends an average of about 90 hours each month preaching on the streets to friends and neighbors about the value of trusting in God. He can speak from experience because it was precisely his trust in Jehovah that enabled him to overcome his drug addiction, a habit that left him with a police record of seven arrests and an incurable paralysis by the age of 18. He has already helped seven of his former associates to trust in God rather than narcotics in order to make life worth living.
Some had to make economic sacrifices to be present. This was true of many Witnesses in the Azores archipelago who had to travel to another island in order to attend the convention at Angra do Heroísmo. One family of five spent several months fattening up two cows that they sold in order to pay the fare.
Trust in God Means Trusting in His Standards
“Trust in Jehovah and do good,” said the psalmist David. (Psalm 37:3) The Witnesses believe, therefore, that sincere trust in God must be evidenced by good conduct. Thus, serving a trustworthy God has motivated them to become trustworthy people. This is something that many observers have come to appreciate.
At the Le Havre convention in France, a telephone engineer was installing a telephone cable in the stadium facilities and expressed concern about leaving his equipment unattended. A town official assured him: “You don’t have to worry about that with the Witnesses. The worst that could happen would be for you to find you have more equipment afterward than you had before.”
At one of the conventions in Sweden, the owner of a motel left all the master keys for his motel with the Witnesses who were organizing the convention. He allowed them to run the motel without any of his staff present. “We have never done this before,” said the owner, “but we trust you.” After the convention, he expressed his satisfaction with the way the Witnesses had taken care of the premises.
Appreciation Expressed for the Witnesses’ Behavior
Trust in God also moves people to apply his standards of cleanliness and orderliness. It motivates them to offer their services as volunteers and helps them to work together in harmony. This aspect of the conventions certainly did not go unnoticed.
The mayor of Terni, Italy, sent the following telegram to the convention delegates assembled in that city: “I would like to convey the sentiments of respect and appreciation of the entire city for the elevated civic sense demonstrated in the use and preparation of the facilities made available to you. Cordial greetings to those taking part in the convention.”
A foreman of the Ice Hall in Mikkeli, Finland, observing the spirit of the Witnesses who volunteered to organize the convention, exclaimed: “I have not found anything negative here, only positive! The spirit of the volunteer workers is great. It is a pleasure to see joyful people who enjoy their work.”
A bus driver who was present at the convention in Nancy, France, remarked: “I was not familiar with Jehovah’s Witnesses, but I know them better now. In the past I had always heard negative remarks about them. But now I see things differently. It is difficult for me to describe the deep sense of well-being here. No one pushes, no one gets irritated, and everything runs like clockwork.”
In Pergusa, Italy, a newspaper published a letter written by a group of local residents thanking the Witnesses for their fine behavior, especially their cleanliness, and the way they cared for the stadium facilities. “Everyone should behave as they do,” the letter stated, “but unfortunately things are different when other types of gatherings are held.”
Several talks at the conventions stressed the need to imitate divine qualities. Jehovah’s Witnesses are striving to do just that. Some were very encouraged by the progress they have already made in this direction.
A newsagent, whose shop is near the convention location in Edinburgh, Scotland, exclaimed: “I am always so delighted when the Witnesses come to Murrayfield! They are so pleasant and polite when they come into the shop​—no pushing, no grumbling, no scrambling to get served. It is a pleasure to have them here, and I look forward to seeing them every year.”
A journalist in Belgium said: “Nowhere else have we seen anything like this.” Another newsman commented: “In our day, it is unthinkable, from a purely human viewpoint, that such large gatherings can still be organized in such a fraternal atmosphere.”
Tomas Bresky, a Swedish television interviewer, was present at the convention in Lulea, Sweden. He summed up his impressions in this way: “You get a feeling of fascination . . . after having mingled with these people for a few days. So firm in their conviction, so uncompromising, so strong in their trust in the Bible. Who is not attracted by an organization that works? When serving 10,000 with food, it seems as if it were just a matter of handing out a few loaves of bread and fishes. Who would not like to have such quiet and patient children? Here you find real discipline and order.”
Baptism Candidates Show Trust in Jehovah
At every convention, opportunity was provided for delegates to symbolize their dedication by baptism in water. The discourse that preceded this ceremony made clear that such a decision reflected trust in Jehovah. Many who presented themselves for baptism had already experienced the benefits of such a trust.
At the convention in Navan, Ireland, Noel Donaghue was baptized. Not long previously, he had been destitute, living in a derelict house in Liverpool, England, and not even caring for himself properly because of depression and deep despair about conditions in the world. His health deteriorated, and he became suicidal. Finally, in February 1984 his legs had to be amputated because of frostbite.
Later that year he returned to his home in Ireland and was contacted by the Witnesses. Soon he was attending meetings, and his despair was replaced by a real hope for the future. “The first half of that year was terrible,” he said, “but the second half was marvelous.” Now he has an optimistic outlook, reflected by his answer when asked how he managed to go preaching from house to house with his artificial limbs. “Well,” he replied, “at least I’m not bothered by cold feet in the winter!”
Among the baptism candidates were elderly ones who had also learned to trust in God. At the district convention held in Colombes Stadium near Paris, Claudine Adolphe, a woman 91 years of age, was baptized. Her daughter had become a Witness some years earlier, and Claudine, despite her advanced age, began to observe the faith and way of life of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Having lost several members of her family in death, she was greatly comforted by the Bible hope of the resurrection that was explained to her. She began to study the Bible and came to know Jehovah and trust in him, the God who promises to bring the dead back to life.
José Benito, who was baptized in El Ferrol, Spain, could also testify to the value of trusting in Jehovah. For four years he had fought to overcome his drug addiction but without success. Then he started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the accurate knowledge of God’s Word, together with the strength that God supplied, enabled him to break free from this habit. He had always had a certain appreciation for spiritual matters, and while under the influence of drugs, he used to preach in bars and on street corners his own particular doctrine concerning Jesus and the need for peace. He was sarcastically nicknamed “the apostle” by the people in his town. Now he has brought his life into harmony with God’s requirements and has learned to preach in a dignified, reasonable way.
Appreciation for Convention Program and Releases
The Witnesses, attending from many lands, were thrilled with the instructive program and the fellowship enjoyed. A full-time preacher, who served 43 years as a Catholic nun, remarked: “It’s the excellent worldwide unity that continues to amaze me. How often I say to myself: ‘Only Jehovah can be the Organizer of such events, unique in a world becoming increasingly divided in all spheres of life!’”
A father of three children from Stoke on Trent, England, wrote: “Each talk seemed to have a point especially for us. Each night as we got home, we thanked Jehovah for making such a provision for us.”
At the Spanish-language conventions, the audience was delighted to receive the book Aid to Bible Understanding in Spanish. One brother in Granada, Spain, obtained a copy and was leafing through it while waiting at a gas station just opposite the convention grounds. One of the attendants noticed the title of the book and said: “That is just what is needed, something to help people understand the Bible. I certainly don’t understand it.” The brother offered to help him, and a Bible study was started with this man the week after the convention.
Above all, the convention program stressed the need to trust in God and his Kingdom rather than in human institutions. In Italy, a well-known journalist noticed this unique aspect of the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He explained on a nationwide television broadcast: “They firmly believe in this message . . . of the victorious return of Christ, which is certainly contained in the New Testament writings. I would say that these themes have been shoved aside not only by the Catholic Church but by all the great Christian religions. They have removed them from the center of that which was the original Christian faith, and these movements [the Witnesses] have rediscovered them. In this sense it is an authentic recovery, a correct recovery.”
This “recovery” of fundamental Christian doctrines has enabled the Witnesses to replace skepticism with faith, despair with hope, and mistrust with confidence. They know that God will never betray their trust in him. This very series of conventions demonstrated that it is worth while to trust in God and to live in harmony with that conviction. At the conclusion of the program, the delegates returned to their homes determined more than ever to ‘trust in Jehovah with all their heart.’​—Proverbs 3:5.

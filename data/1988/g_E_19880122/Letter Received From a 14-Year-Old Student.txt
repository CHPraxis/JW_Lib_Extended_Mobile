Letter Received From a 14-Year-Old Student
On February 14, on what the world recognizes as Valentine’s Day, my honors English teacher asked his students to make Valentine cards. I couldn’t convince him to let me do something else, so I wrote this poem:
If you know God,
many would say,
You would not celebrate
Valentine’s Day.
For it originated
with the myth Cupid,
An ancient false god
of some who were stupid.
So this card reflects,
in a poetic way,
Why I don’t celebrate
Valentine’s Day.

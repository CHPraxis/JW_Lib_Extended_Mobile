<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On February 14, on what the world recognizes as Valentine’s Day, my honors English teacher asked his students to make Valentine cards. I couldn’t convince him to let me do something else, so I wrote this poem:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sl">If you know God,</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sp">many would say,</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sl">You would not celebrate</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sp">Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sl">For it originated</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sp">with the myth Cupid,</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sl">An ancient false god</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp">of some who were stupid.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sl">So this card reflects,</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sp">in a poetic way,</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sl">Why I don’t celebrate</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sp">Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

Help in Growing Up
GROWING up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should I smoke? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? What about masturbation and homosexuality? One youth wrote:
“I am 13 years old now almost, and I just wanted to thank you for the Youth book. This book has helped me so much through these hard times of growing up. I just wish all kids my age or older knew about this book.”
This book, which considers all the above questions and many more, is Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. Receive a copy by filling in and mailing the coupon. Only $1.

Overcoming Racial Prejudice
SOUTH AFRICAN Isaac Langa was raised in the black township of Alexandra, Johannesburg. Having a strong racialistic spirit, he hated whites and viewed the Zulu nation as superior to other blacks. Attending meetings arranged by the ANC (African National Congress), a banned antigovernment organization, Isaac became involved in the South African riots of 1976. He recalls: “Many were shot dead by police; some became cripples for life. As I saw all of this, I developed a spirit of revenge. I wanted to get an automatic gun and shoot as many as I could before being killed myself. Unable to find one, I decided to follow the example of others who left for neighboring countries in order to get military training.”
At this crucial time Isaac was contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses in their house-to-house preaching. Books explaining the Bible’s message were left with him, and one in particular, True Peace and Security​—From What Source?, made a lasting impression. He explains: “Now I found the true peace I was looking for. I learned that the Bible says: ‘That which is made crooked cannot be made straight,’ and: ‘It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.’ (Ecclesiastes 1:15; Jeremiah 10:23) So it became clear to me that our struggle was in vain because it was not going to bring peace on earth. Only God’s Kingdom will do so. (Revelation 11:17, 18) The Bible has also helped me change my view of other races. (Acts 10:34, 35) It is heartwarming to know that people of all races and tribes are already living with the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth under God’s Kingdom.”
Isaac now serves as a full-time traveling minister, strengthening congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses made up of many different national groups.

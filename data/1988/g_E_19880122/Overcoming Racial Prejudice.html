<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SOUTH AFRICAN Isaac Langa was raised in the black township of Alexandra, Johannesburg. Having a strong racialistic spirit, he hated whites and viewed the Zulu nation as superior to other blacks. Attending meetings arranged by the ANC (African National Congress), a banned antigovernment organization, Isaac became involved in the South African riots of 1976. He recalls: “Many were shot dead by police; some became cripples for life. As I saw all of this, I developed a spirit of revenge. I wanted to get an automatic gun and shoot as many as I could before being killed myself. Unable to find one, I decided to follow the example of others who left for neighboring countries in order to get military training.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At this crucial time Isaac was contacted by Jehovah’s Witnesses in their house-to-house preaching. Books explaining the Bible’s message were left with him, and one in particular, <em>True Peace and Security​—From What Source?, </em>made a lasting impression. He explains: “Now I found the true peace I was looking for. I learned that the Bible says: ‘That which is made crooked cannot be made straight,’ and: ‘It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:15-21:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:23</a>) So it became clear to me that our struggle was in vain because it was not going to bring peace on earth. Only God’s Kingdom will do so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:17-66:11:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 11:17, 18</a>) The Bible has also helped me change my view of other races. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>) It is heartwarming to know that people of all races and tribes are already living with the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth under God’s Kingdom.”</p>

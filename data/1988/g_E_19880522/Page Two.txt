Eavesdropping bugs are as difficult to detect as skin parasites. As tiny as a match head, they can be put in pens that write, disguised as aspirin tablets or as the olive in a martini, worn as an earring, or even embedded under the surface of the skin. They can pick up a whisper in a room and transmit the voice a quarter of a mile [.4Â km] away.
And these bugs can be harder to exterminate than their pesky little namesakes!

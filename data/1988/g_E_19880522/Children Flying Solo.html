<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“It’s a sad commentary on the times,” remarked an airlines spokesman. He was referring to the record number of children flying alone all over the United States with only their dolls, toys, or pet hamsters as traveling companions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Most youngsters are shuttling between parents separated by divorce or jobs. “I’ve been flying alone since I was 5,” said one poised 12-year-old. Not all children, however, relish flying solo. Some find it a frightening experience.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For the most part, airline staff say children are a pleasure. They are more agreeable and don’t have much carry-on baggage. “They follow directions,” said one passenger-service supervisor. “If we could get our adults to act like them we’d be O.K.”</p>

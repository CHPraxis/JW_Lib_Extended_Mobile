A Message for Today
The Watchtower and Awake! contain such a message, as noted by a recent reader who requested a subscription and wrote: “I have been reading your magazine with great interest. I had a chance to read the corresponding scriptures to the different articles during my leisure time.
“I am always amazed at the message of your magazine in light of today’s news. It can’t be emphasized enough as to how necessary your publications are for a better understanding of the Bible. Your magazine was the reason why I decided to get out my dusty Bible and look into the book of books. I really look forward to each issue.”
You too can have The Watchtower and Awake! delivered to your home. Send only $10, and you will receive both of these magazines (four copies a month) for one year.
Please send a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake! I enclose $10 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

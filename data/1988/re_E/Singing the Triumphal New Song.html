<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">HOW refreshing it is to turn to John’s next vision! In contrast with the dragon’s grotesque beastlike organizations, we now see Jehovah’s loyal servants and their activities during the Lord’s day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:10-66:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 1:10</a>) Already, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:3-66:7:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3</a> has disclosed to us that the four winds of destruction are being held back until all 144,000 of these anointed slaves are sealed. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17</a> has made known that these “remaining ones of [the woman’s] seed” become the special target of Satan, the dragon, during that time. And <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 13</a> has vividly depicted the political organizations raised up on earth by Satan to bring intense pressure and cruel persecution on Jehovah’s faithful servants. But that archenemy cannot thwart God’s purpose! We will now learn that despite Satan’s malevolent activity, all the 144,000 are triumphantly gathered.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>John, and with him the John class today, is given a preview of that happy outcome: <strong><em>“And I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 14:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>As we have seen, this Lamb is the same as the Michael who cleansed the heavens by casting out the Devil and his demons. He is the Michael whom Daniel describes as “standing in behalf of the sons of [God’s] people” as he prepares to “stand up” in executing Jehovah’s righteous judgments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 9</a>) Since 1914 this self-sacrificing Lamb of God has been standing on Mount Zion as the Messianic King.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. What is “the Mount Zion” upon which the Lamb and the 144,000 are “standing”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>It is just as Jehovah foretold: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:6-19:2:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:2-19:110:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 110:2</a>) This no longer refers to the earthly Mount Zion, the geographical location of earthly Jerusalem, in which city human kings in the line of David used to reign.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:6-49:3:6" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Ephesians 3:6</a>) It is the glorious royal situation to which Jehovah elevates them during the Lord’s day.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>John sees not only Jesus but the complete body of the 144,000 fellow heirs of the heavenly Kingdom standing upon the Mount Zion. At the time represented by the vision, many, but not all, of the 144,000 are already in heaven. Later in the same vision, John learns that some of the holy ones still have to endure and die faithful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:12-66:14:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 14:12, 13</a>) Evidently, then, some of the 144,000 are still on earth. So how is it that John sees all of them standing with Jesus on Mount Zion?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> In that, as members of the congregation of anointed Christians, these have now “approached a Mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22</a>) Like Paul when he was still on earth, they have already​—in a spiritual sense—​been raised up to be in union with Christ Jesus in heavenly places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:5-49:2:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:5, 6</a>) Additionally, in 1919 they responded to the invitation, “Come on up here,” and in a figurative way “went up into heaven in the cloud.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:12-66:11:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 11:12</a>) In view of these scriptures, we can see that all the 144,000​—spiritually speaking—​are located on Mount Zion with Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. Whose names are written on the foreheads of the 144,000, and what is the significance of each name?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The 144,000 have no part with the worshippers of the wild beast, who are marked with the symbolic number 666. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:15-66:13:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 13:15-18</a>) In contrast, these loyal ones have the name of God and of the Lamb written <span id="page200" class="pageNum" data-no="200" data-before-text="200"></span>on their foreheads. No doubt John, a Jew, saw God’s name in Hebrew lettering, יהוה.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> In having the name of Jesus’ Father symbolically written on their foreheads, these sealed ones make known to all that they are <em>Jehovah’s </em>witnesses, <em>His </em>slaves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:12-66:3:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 3:12</a>) Their having Jesus’ name also displayed on their foreheads indicates that they acknowledge being owned by him. He is their betrothed “husband,” and they are his prospective “bride,” “a new creation” serving God with heavenly life in view.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Singing as if a New Song</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. What singing does John hear, and how does he describe it?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In harmony with this, John reports: <strong><em>“And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.</em></strong> <strong><em>And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to master that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought from the earth.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:2-66:14:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 14:2,</em></strong> <strong><em>3</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> It is no wonder that John, upon hearing 144,000 voices joined in one melodious chorus, is reminded of roaring waterfalls and pealing thunderclaps. How pleasant that clear harplike accompaniment! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:81:2-19:81:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 81:2</a>) What choir on earth could ever attain to the grandeur of that magnificent chorus?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. (a) What is the new song of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:3" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Revelation 14:3</a>? (b) How is it that the song of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:1-19:149:1" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Psalm 149:1</a> is new in our day?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>And what is this “new song”? As we noted in discussing <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10</a>, the song has to do with Jehovah’s Kingdom purposes and his wonderful provision, through Jesus Christ, for making spiritual Israel “a kingdom and priests to our God.” It is a song of praise to Jehovah publicizing the new things he is accomplishing by means of the Israel of God and in behalf of it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a>) Members of this spiritual Israel respond to the psalmist’s invitation: “Praise Jah, you people! Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise in the congregation of loyal ones. Let Israel rejoice in its grand Maker, the sons of Zion​—let them be joyful in their King.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:1-19:149:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 149:1, 2</a>) True, those words were written centuries ago, but in our day, they have been sung with new understanding. In 1914 the Messianic Kingdom was born. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>) In 1919 Jehovah’s people on earth began to announce “the word of the kingdom” with renewed zeal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:19-40:13:19" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 13:19</a>) Stimulated by the yeartext for 1919 (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:17</a>) and encouraged by their restoration to a spiritual paradise, they began in that year to ‘sing to Jehovah with music in their hearts.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:19-49:5:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8. Why is it that only the 144,000 are able to learn the new song of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:3" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Revelation 14:3</a>?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Why is it, though, that only the 144,000 are able to learn the song mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 14:3</a>? Because it has to do with their experiences as chosen heirs of God’s Kingdom. They alone are adopted as sons of God and anointed with holy spirit. They alone are bought from the earth to become part of that heavenly Kingdom, and they alone “will be priests . . . and will rule as kings” with Jesus Christ for a thousand years to bring mankind to perfection. They alone are seen to be “singing as if a new song” in the very presence of Jehovah.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> These unique experiences <span id="page201" class="pageNum" data-no="201" data-before-text="201"></span>and prospects give them a singular appreciation of the Kingdom and enable them to sing about it in a way that no one else can.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:13-51:1:13" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:11-52:2:12" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 2:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9. How have the great crowd responded to the singing of the anointed ones, and what exhortation have they thus fulfilled?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Nevertheless, others listen and respond to their singing. Since 1935 a growing great crowd of other sheep has heard their triumphant song and been moved to join with them in publicizing God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:9</a>) True, these newcomers cannot learn to sing exactly the same new song that the future rulers of God’s Kingdom sing. But they too sound a melodious chorus of praise to Jehovah that is an anthem lauding Jehovah for the new things he is accomplishing. They thus fulfill the psalmist’s exhortation: “Sing to Jehovah a new song. Sing to Jehovah, all you people of the earth. Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him. Declare among the nations his glory, among all the peoples his wonderful works. Ascribe to Jehovah, O you families of the peoples, ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength. Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:7-19:96:7" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:10-19:96:10" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:1-19:98:9" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 98:1-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. How is it possible for the 144,000 to sing “before” the symbolic 24 elders?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>How can the 144,000 sing “before” the elders, since the 24 elders are the 144,000 in their glorious heavenly position? Early in the Lord’s day, those “dead in union with Christ” were resurrected as spirit creatures. Thus, faithful anointed Christians who have conquered are now in heaven, symbolically fulfilling functions comparable to those of 24 divisions of priestly elders. They are included in the vision of Jehovah’s heavenly organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:15-52:4:16" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:1-13:24:18" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 24:1-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:4-66:4:4" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Revelation 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:11-66:6:11" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> 6:11</a>) The remnant of the 144,000 still on earth are therefore singing the new song before, or in the sight of, their resurrected brothers in heaven.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>At this point we might also ask: Why is it that these anointed overcomers are referred to as the symbolic 24 elders as well as the 144,000? It is because Revelation views this one group from two different standpoints. The 24 elders are always shown in their ultimate position around Jehovah’s throne, installed as kings and priests in the heavens. They symbolize the entire group of 144,000 in their heavenly position, although at present a small remnant of these is still on earth.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Continuing his description of the 144,000 who are “bought from the earth,” John tells us: <strong><em>“These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins.

The apostle Paul wrote to Christians who had a heavenly calling that, whereas there are advantages to Christian singleness, marriage is preferable under certain circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:1-46:7:2" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:37" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 36, 37</a>) What characterizes this class is a <em>spiritual </em>virginity.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13. Why are the 144,000 a fitting bride for Jesus Christ, and how do they “keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes”?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Additionally, “no falsehood was found in their mouths.” In this, they are like their King, Jesus Christ. As a perfect human, “he committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:22" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21, 22</a>) In being simultaneously without blemish and truthful, the 144,000 are prepared as a chaste bride for Jehovah’s great High Priest.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>The 144,000 are “bought from the earth,” “bought from among mankind.” They are adopted as sons of God, and after their resurrection, they will no longer be mere flesh-and-blood humans. As mentioned in verse 4, they become the “firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.” True, back in the first century, Jesus was “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:20-46:15:20" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:23-46:15:23" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 23</a>) But the 144,000 are the “certain firstfruits” of imperfect mankind, purchased by means of Jesus’ sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:18-59:1:18" data-bid="43-1" class="b">James 1:18</a>) Nevertheless, the ingathering of fruitage from mankind does not end with them. The book of Revelation has already pointed to the harvesting of an unnumbered great crowd that cries with a loud voice: <span id="page203" class="pageNum" data-no="203" data-before-text="203"></span>“Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.” This great crowd will survive the great tribulation, and as they continue to be refreshed by “fountains of waters of life,” they will be raised to human perfection on earth. Sometime after the great tribulation, Hades will be emptied, and countless millions of other humans will be resurrected and have the opportunity to drink from those same waters of life. With this in mind, it would be correct to call the great crowd a firstfruits of the other sheep​—they are the first to ‘wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb’ with the hope of living forever on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:17-66:7:17" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:12-66:20:13" data-bid="44-4" class="b"> 20:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. What correspondencies are there between the three different firstfruits and the festivals celebrated under the Mosaic Law?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>These three firstfruits (Jesus Christ, the 144,000, and the great crowd) have interesting correspondencies in the festivals celebrated according to the ancient Mosaic Law. On Nisan 16, during the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, a sheaf of the firstfruits of the barley harvest was offered to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:6-3:23:14" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:6-14</a>) Nisan 16 was the day Jesus was resurrected from the dead. On the 50th day from Nisan 16, in the third month, the Israelites celebrated the festival of the harvest of the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:16-2:23:16" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Exodus 23:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:15-3:23:16" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Leviticus 23:15, 16</a>) This festival came to be called Pentecost (from a Greek word meaning “fiftieth”), and it was at Pentecost 33 C.E. that the first members of the 144,000 were anointed with holy spirit. Finally, in the seventh month when the whole harvest was gathered in, there was the Festival of Booths, a time of joyful thanksgiving when the Israelites dwelt for a week in booths made of, among other things, palm branches. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:33-3:23:43" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>) Correspondingly, the great crowd, who are part of the great ingathering, give thanks before the throne with “palm branches in their hands.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>John next writes: <strong><em>“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,</em></strong> <strong><em>saying in a loud voice: ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="49-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 14:6,</em></strong> <strong><em>7</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> The angel is flying “in midheaven,” where the birds <span id="page205" class="pageNum" data-no="205" data-before-text="205"></span>fly.

Of how much greater range than any television news flash is this angel’s worldwide proclamation!</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Everyone is urged to fear, not the wild beast and its image, but Jehovah, who is incomparably more powerful than any symbolic beast controlled by Satan. Why, Jehovah created heaven and earth, and now the time has come for him to judge the earth! (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:18</a>.)

How often angelic guidance has been apparent in bringing one of Jehovah’s Witnesses to a home where some distressed soul was yearning, even praying, for spiritual help!</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 1. What does the strong angel call upon John to do?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">BEFORE the second woe is finally past, the strong angel calls upon John to take part in another prophetic presentation, this one having to do with the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:12-66:9:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 9:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:1-66:10:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10:1</a>) Here is what John reports: <strong><em>“And a reed like a rod was given me as he said: ‘Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it.’”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:1</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>The Temple Sanctuary</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 2. (a) What temple sanctuary would endure right up to our day? (b) Who is the High Priest of the temple sanctuary, and what is its Most Holy?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The temple here mentioned cannot be any literal temple in Jerusalem, since the last of these was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E. The apostle Paul, however, showed that even before that destruction, there had appeared another temple sanctuary that would endure right up to our day. This was the great spiritual temple that fulfilled the prophetic types provided by the tabernacle and later by the temples built in Jerusalem. It is “the true tent, which Jehovah put up, and not man,” and its High Priest is Jesus, whom Paul describes as having already “sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.” Its Most Holy is the location of Jehovah’s presence in heaven itself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 8:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:11-58:9:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 3. At the tabernacle, what was pictured by (a) the curtain separating the Most Holy from the Holy? (b) the animal sacrifices? (c) the altar of sacrifice?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The apostle Paul explains that the curtain of the tabernacle, separating the Most Holy from the Holy compartment, pictures Jesus’ flesh. When Jesus sacrificed his life, this curtain was rent in two, showing that Jesus’ flesh was no longer a barrier to his entry into Jehovah’s presence in heaven. On the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice, his anointed underpriests who died faithful would, in due course, also pass into the heavens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:50-40:27:51" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 27:50, 51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:3-58:9:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Hebrews 9:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:19-58:10:20" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 10:19, 20</a>) Paul points out, too, that the continual sacrifices of animals at the tabernacle pointed forward to Jesus’ one sacrifice of his perfect human life. The altar of sacrifice in the courtyard represented Jehovah’s provision, according to his will, for accepting Jesus’ sacrifice in behalf of the “many”​—of the anointed and, later, of the other sheep—​who would be “earnestly looking for him for their salvation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:28-58:9:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:9-58:10:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 10:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 4. What was symbolized by (a) the Holy Place (b) the inner courtyard?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>From this divinely inspired information, we can conclude that the Holy Place in the tabernacle symbolizes a holy condition enjoyed first by Christ and then by the anointed members of the royal priesthood of the 144,000 while they are still on earth, before entering through “the curtain.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:9</a>) It well represents their having been adopted as spiritual sons of God, even as God acknowledged Jesus to be his Son following Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan in 29 C.E.

This pictures the perfect <span id="page162" class="pageNum" data-no="162" data-before-text="162"></span>standing of the man Jesus that qualified him to offer his life for mankind. It also represents the righteous standing as holy ones, imputed on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice, that his anointed followers enjoy while on earth.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Measuring the Temple Sanctuary</strong></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 5. In Hebrew Scripture prophecies, what was implied by (a) the measuring of Jerusalem? (b) the measuring of Ezekiel’s visionary temple?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>John is told to “measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it.” What does this imply? In the Hebrew Scripture prophecies, such measuring provided a guarantee that justice would be rendered on the basis of Jehovah’s perfect standards. In the days of wicked King Manasseh, the prophetic measuring of Jerusalem testified to an unalterable judgment of destruction on that city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:13-12:21:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Kings 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:8-25:2:8" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Lamentations 2:8</a>) Later, however, when Jeremiah saw Jerusalem being measured, this confirmed that the city would be rebuilt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:39-24:31:39" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:39</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:2-38:2:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Zechariah 2:2-8</a>.) Likewise, the extensive and detailed measuring of the visionary temple witnessed by Ezekiel was a guarantee to the Jewish exiles in Babylon that true worship would be restored in their homeland. It was also a reminder that, in view of their errors, Israel henceforth had to measure up to God’s holy standards.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:40:3-26:40:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 40:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:43:10-26:43:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 43:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 6. Of what is John’s being told to measure the temple sanctuary and the priests worshipping in it a sign? Explain.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Therefore, when John is commanded to measure the temple sanctuary and those priests worshipping in it, it is a sign that nothing can prevent the fulfillment of Jehovah’s purposes regarding the temple arrangement and those associated with it, and that those purposes are nearing their climax. Now that all things have been placed under the feet of Jehovah’s strong angel, it is the time for “the mountain of the house of Jehovah” to become “firmly established above the top of the mountains.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) Jehovah’s pure worship must be exalted, after centuries of Christendom’s apostasy. It is also time for those of Jesus’ faithful brothers who have died to be resurrected into “the Holy of Holies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:14-52:4:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 4:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:11-66:6:11" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Revelation 6:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 14:4</a>) And the last sealed ones on earth of “the slaves of our God” must be measured according to the divine standards in order to qualify for their permanent place in the temple arrangement as spirit-begotten sons of God. The John class today is fully aware of those holy standards and is determined to measure up to them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:41-40:13:42" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Matthew 13:41, 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:13-49:1:14" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:20-45:11:20" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 11:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>The Trampling of the Courtyard</strong></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 7. (a) Why is John told not to measure the courtyard? (b) When was the holy city trampled underfoot for 42 months? (c) How did the clergy of Christendom fail to uphold Jehovah’s righteous standards for 42 months?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Why was John forbidden to measure the courtyard? He tells us in these words: <strong><em>“But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:2-66:11:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:2</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>We have noted that the inner courtyard pictures the righteous standing on earth of spirit-begotten Christians. As we shall see, the reference here is to the literal 42 months extending from December 1914 to June 1918, when all professing Christians were put to a severe test. Would they uphold Jehovah’s righteous standards during those war years? Most did not. En bloc, the clergy of Christendom put nationalism ahead of obedience to divine law. On both sides of the war, which was fought mainly in Christendom, the clergy preached the young men into the trenches. Millions <span id="page163" class="pageNum" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>were slaughtered. By the time that judgment started with the house of God in 1918, the United States had also entered that bloodspilling, and the clergy of all of Christendom had incurred a bloodguilt that still cries out for divine vengeance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:17-60:4:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:17</a>) Their being cast out has become permanent, irreversible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:7-23:59:8" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:19:3-24:19:4" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 19:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> 8. During World War I, what did many of the Bible Students realize, but what did they not fully appreciate?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What, though, of the small group of Bible Students? Were they to be measured immediately in 1914 by their adherence to divine standards? No. Like the professed Christians of Christendom, they too must be tested. They were ‘cast clear out, given to the nations’ to be severely tried and persecuted. Many of them realized that they should not go out and kill their fellowman, but as yet they did not fully appreciate Christian neutrality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Micah 4:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> John 17:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:15-62:3:15" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 1 John 3:15</a>) Under pressure from the nations, some compromised.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 9. What is the holy city that was trampled underfoot by the nations, and on earth, who represents this city?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>How was it, though, that the holy city was trampled underfoot by those nations? Clearly, this does not refer to the Jerusalem that was destroyed over 25 years before Revelation was written. Rather, the holy city is New Jerusalem, described later in Revelation, that is represented now on earth by the remaining anointed Christians in the temple’s inner courtyard. In time, these also will become a part of the holy city. So trampling on them is tantamount to trampling on the city itself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:21" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 9-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><span id="page164" class="pageNum" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span><strong>The Two Witnesses</strong></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">10. What are Jehovah’s faithful witnesses to do while being trampled on?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Even while being trampled on, these loyal ones do not cease to be Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. Hence, the prophecy continues: <strong><em>“‘And I will cause my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days dressed in sackcloth.’</em></strong> <strong><em>These are symbolized by the two olive trees and the two lampstands and are standing before the Lord of the earth.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:3-66:11:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:3,</em></strong> <strong><em>4</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">11. What did it mean for the faithful anointed Christians to prophesy “in sackcloth”?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>These faithful anointed Christians needed the quality of endurance, for they had to prophesy “in sackcloth.” What did this mean? In Bible times sackcloth often symbolized mourning. Wearing it was a sign that the person had been brought low in sorrow or distress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:34-1:37:34" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 37:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:16:15-18:16:16" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Job 16:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:31-26:27:31" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 27:31</a>) Sackcloth was associated with the mournful messages of doom or grief that God’s prophets had to proclaim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:3:8-23:3:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:3:24-23:3:26" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 24-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:37-24:48:37" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 48:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:3-24:49:3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 49:3</a>) The wearing of sackcloth could indicate humility or repentance in view of divine warning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:5-32:3:5" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jonah 3:5</a>) The sackcloth worn by the two witnesses appears to indicate their humble endurance in announcing Jehovah’s judgments. They were witnesses proclaiming his day of vengeance that would bring mourning also to the nations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:41-5:32:43" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:41-43</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">12. Why does the time period during which the holy city was to be trampled underfoot seem to be literal?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>The John class had to preach this message for a definitely stated time: 1,260 days, or 42 months, the same length of time that the holy city was to be trampled underfoot. This period seems to be literal, since it is expressed in two different ways, first in months and then in days. Additionally, at the beginning of the Lord’s day, there was a marked period of three and a half years when the hard experiences of God’s people matched the events prophesied here​—starting in December 1914 and continuing to June 1918. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:10-66:1:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 1:10</a>) They preached a “sackcloth” message concerning Jehovah’s judgment of Christendom and the world.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">13. (a) What is denoted by the fact that the anointed Christians were symbolized by two witnesses? (b) What prophecy of Zechariah is brought to mind by John’s calling the two witnesses “the two olive trees and the two lampstands”?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The fact that they were symbolized by two witnesses confirms to us that their message was accurate and well founded. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:6-5:17:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:18" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> John 8:17, 18</a>.) John calls them “the two olive trees and the two lampstands,” saying that they “are standing before the Lord of the earth.” This is an evident reference to the prophecy of Zechariah, who saw a seven-branched lampstand and two olive trees. The olive trees were said to picture “the two anointed ones,” that is, Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua, “standing alongside the Lord of the whole earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:1-38:4:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:14-38:4:14" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">14. (a) What was indicated by Zechariah’s vision of the two olive trees? and the lampstand? (b) What would the anointed Christians experience during the first world war?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Zechariah lived in a time of rebuilding, and his vision of the two olive trees meant that Zerubbabel and Joshua would be blessed with Jehovah’s spirit in strengthening the people for the work. The vision of the lampstand reminded Zechariah not to ‘despise the day of small things’ because Jehovah’s purposes would be carried out​—“‘not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,’ Jehovah of armies has said.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:10-38:4:10" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:9-38:8:9" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 8:9</a>) The small band of Christians persistently carrying the light of truth to mankind during the first world war would similarly be used in a rebuilding work. They too would be a source of encouragement and, few as they were, would learn to rely on Jehovah’s strength, not despising the day of small beginnings.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">15. (a) The fact that the anointed Christians were described as two witnesses also reminds us of what? Explain. (b) What kind of signs are the two witnesses authorized to perform?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span><sup>15 </sup>The fact that they were described as two witnesses also reminds us of the transfiguration. In that vision, three of Jesus’ apostles saw him in Kingdom glory, accompanied by Moses and Elijah. This foreshadowed Jesus’ sitting down on his glorious throne in 1914 to accomplish a work prefigured by those two prophets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 17:1-3</a>) Fittingly, the two witnesses are now seen to perform signs reminiscent of those of Moses and Elijah. For example, John says of them: <strong><em>“And if anyone wants to harm them, fire issues forth from their mouths and devours their enemies; and if anyone should want to harm them, in this manner he must be killed. These have the authority to shut up heaven that no rain should fall during the days of their prophesying.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:5-66:11:6" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:5, 6a</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">16. (a) How does the sign involving fire remind us of the time when Moses’ authority was challenged in Israel? (b) How did Christendom’s clergy defy the Bible Students and stir up trouble for them during the first world war, and how did these fight back?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>This reminds us of the time when Moses’ authority was challenged in Israel. That prophet uttered fiery words of judgment, and Jehovah destroyed the rebels, consuming 250 of them by literal fire from heaven.

But God’s witnesses had higher credentials as ministers: those meek persons who heeded their Scriptural message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:2-47:3:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>) In 1917 the Bible Students published <em>The Finished Mystery, </em>a powerful commentary on Revelation and Ezekiel. This was followed by the distribution of 10,000,000 copies of the four-page tract <em>The Bible Students Monthly </em>with the feature article entitled “The Fall of Babylon​—Why Christendom Must Now Suffer—​the Final Outcome.” In the United States, the irate clergy used the war hysteria as an excuse to get the book banned. In other countries the book was censored. Nevertheless, God’s servants kept fighting <span id="page166" class="pageNum" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>back with fiery issues of the four-page tract entitled <em>Kingdom News. </em>As the Lord’s day proceeded, other publications would make clear Christendom’s spiritually defunct condition.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:14-24:5:14" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jeremiah 5:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>So severe was this plague on Christendom that after the two witnesses had prophesied for 42 months in sackcloth, Christendom used her worldly influence to have them ‘killed.’ John writes: <strong><em>“And when they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them.</em></strong> <strong><em>And their corpses will be on the broad way of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also impaled.</em></strong> <strong><em>And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not let their corpses be laid in a tomb.</em></strong> <strong><em>And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and enjoy themselves, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:7-66:11:10" data-bid="42-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:7</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong><strong><em>10</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>From 1914 to 1918 the nations were occupied with the first world war. Nationalistic feelings ran high, and in the spring of 1918, the religious enemies of the two witnesses took advantage of the situation. They maneuvered the State’s legal apparatus so that responsible ministers of the Bible Students were imprisoned on <span id="page168" class="pageNum" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>false charges of sedition. Faithful coworkers were stunned. Kingdom activity almost ceased. It was as though the preaching work were dead. In Bible times it was a terrible indignity not to be interred in a memorial tomb.

This detail in the prophecy thus indicates the shame that the two witnesses had to endure. Those mentioned above who were imprisoned were even denied bail while their cases were on appeal.

<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">22. (a) What is the great city? (b) How did the public press join in with the clergy in rejoicing over the silencing of the two witnesses? (See box.)</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>John gives us some clues. He says that Jesus was impaled there. So we immediately think of Jerusalem. But he also says that the great city is called Sodom and Egypt. Well, literal Jerusalem was once called Sodom because of her unclean practices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:8-23:1:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:8-10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:49-26:16:49" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ezekiel 16:49,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:53-26:16:58" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 53-58</a>.)

It pictures Christendom, the modern equivalent of unfaithful Jerusalem, the organization whose members had so much <span id="page169" class="pageNum" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>reason to rejoice when they silenced the disturbing preaching of the two witnesses.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>The public press joined the clergy in vilifying God’s people, one paper saying: “The finis of <em>The Finished Mystery </em>has been given.” Nothing, though, could have been further from the truth! The two witnesses did not stay dead. We read: <strong><em>“And after the three and a half days spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them.</em></strong> <strong><em>And they heard a loud voice out of heaven say to them: ‘Come on up here.’ And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:11-66:11:12" data-bid="49-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:11,</em></strong> <strong><em>12</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> Thus, they had an experience similar to that of the dry bones in the valley that Ezekiel visited in vision. Jehovah breathed upon those dry bones, and they came to life, providing a picture of the rebirth of the nation of Israel after 70 years of captivity in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:14" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>) These two prophecies, in Ezekiel and in Revelation, had their striking modern-day fulfillment in 1919, when Jehovah restored his “deceased” witnesses to vibrant life.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">24. When the two witnesses came to life, what was the effect on their religious persecutors?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>What a shock for those persecutors! The corpses of the two witnesses were suddenly alive and active again. It was a bitter pill for those clergymen to swallow, the more so since the Christian ministers whom they had schemed to put in prison were free again, later to be fully exonerated. The shock must have been even greater when, in September 1919, the Bible <span id="page170" class="pageNum" data-no="170" data-before-text="170"></span>Students held a convention in Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A. Here J. F. Rutherford, recently released from prison, stirred conventioners with his talk “Announcing the Kingdom,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:2-66:15:2" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Revelation 15:2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Isaiah 52:7</a>.

<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">25. (a) When were the two witnesses told, “Come on up here,” and how did that take place? (b) What shocking effect did the restoration of the two witnesses have on the great city?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Christendom tried again and again to repeat her triumph of 1918. She resorted to mob action, legal maneuvering, imprisonment, even executions​—all to no avail! After 1919 the spiritual domain of the two witnesses was out of her reach. In that year Jehovah had said to them: “Come on up here,” and they had ascended to an elevated spiritual state where their enemies could see them but could not touch them. John describes the shocking effect their restoration had on the great city: <strong><em>“And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and a tenth of the city fell; and seven thousand persons were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:13-66:11:13" data-bid="52-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 11:13</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>There were truly great convulsions in the realm of religion. The ground seemed to move under the leaders of the established churches as this body of revivified Christians got to work. One tenth of their city, figuratively 7,000 persons, were so profoundly affected that they are spoken of as being killed.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">26. Who are represented by the “tenth of the city” and the “seven thousand” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:13-66:11:13" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Revelation 11:13</a>? Explain.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>The expression “a tenth of the city” reminds us that Isaiah prophesied regarding ancient Jerusalem that a tenth would survive the destruction of the city as a holy seed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:13-23:6:13" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:13</a>) Similarly, the number 7,000 reminds us that when Elijah felt that he alone remained faithful in Israel, Jehovah told him that there were, in fact, still 7,000 who had not bent down to Baal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:14-11:19:14" data-bid="54-1" class="b">1 Kings 19:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:18-11:19:18" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 18</a>) In the first century, the apostle Paul said that these 7,000 pictured the remnant of the Jews who had responded to the good news about the Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:1-45:11:5" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Romans 11:1-5</a>) These scriptures help us to understand that the “seven thousand” and the “tenth of the city” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:13-66:11:13" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Revelation 11:13</a> are those who respond to the restored two witnesses and abandon the sinful great city.

<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">27, 28. (a) How did ‘the rest give glory to the God of heaven?’ (b) What were Christendom’s clergy forced to acknowledge?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>But how did ‘the rest [of Christendom] give glory to the God of heaven’? Certainly not by abandoning their apostate religion and becoming servants of God. Rather, it is as explained in Vincent’s <em>Word Studies in the New Testament, </em>in discussing the expression “gave glory to the God of heaven.” There it is stated: “The phrase signifies not conversion, nor repentance, nor thanksgiving, but <em>recognition, </em>which is its usual sense in scripture. Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:19-6:7:19" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Josh. vii. 19</a> (Sept.). <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:24-43:9:24" data-bid="58-1" class="b">John ix. 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:23-44:12:23" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> Acts xii. 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:20-45:4:20" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Rom. iv. 20</a>.” To her chagrin, Christendom had to acknowledge that the God of the Bible Students had performed a great act in restoring them to Christian activity.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>It may be that the clergy gave this acknowledgment only mentally, or to themselves. Certainly, none of them went on record as publicly acknowledging the God of the two witnesses. But Jehovah’s prophecy through John helps us to discern what was in their hearts and realize the humiliating shock that they experienced in 1919. From that year onward, as the “seven thousand” <span id="page171" class="pageNum" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>left Christendom despite her determined efforts to hold on to her sheep, the clergy were forced to recognize that the God of the John class was stronger than their god. In later years they would realize this even more clearly, as many more of their flock would depart, echoing the words of the people when Elijah triumphed over the Baal religionists at Mount Carmel: “Jehovah is the true God! Jehovah is the true God!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:39-11:18:39" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:39</a>.</p>

<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sc">  In his book <em>Preachers Present Arms, </em>published in 1933, Ray H. Abrams refers to the clergy’s bitter opposition to the Bible Students’ book <em>The Finished Mystery. </em>He reviews the clergy’s endeavors to rid themselves of the Bible Students and their “pestilential persuasion.” This led to the court case that resulted in sentencing of J. F. Rutherford and seven companions to long years of imprisonment. Dr. Abrams adds: “An analysis of the whole case leads to the conclusion that the churches and the clergy were originally behind the movement to stamp out the Russellites. In Canada, in February, 1918, the ministers began a systematic campaign against them and their publications, particularly <em>The Finished Mystery. </em>According to the Winnipeg <em>Tribune, </em>. . . the suppression of their book was believed to have been directly brought about by the ‘representations of the clergy.’”</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sc">  Dr. Abrams continues: “When the news of the twenty-year sentences reached the editors of the religious press, practically every one of these publications, great and small, rejoiced over the event. I have been unable to discover any words of sympathy in any of the orthodox religious journals. ‘There can be no question,’ concluded Upton Sinclair, that ‘the persecution . . . sprang in part from the fact that they had won the hatred of “orthodox” religious bodies.’ What the combined efforts of the churches had failed to do the government now seemed to have succeeded in accomplishing for them.” After quoting the derogatory comments of a number of religious publications, the writer referred to the reversal of the decision in the Court of Appeals and remarked: “This verdict was greeted with silence in the churches.”</p>

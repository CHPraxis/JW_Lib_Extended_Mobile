<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"> 1. What will have taken place when the seven bowls have been poured out to a finality, and what questions now arise regarding the bowls?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb">JOHN has already introduced the angels commissioned to pour out the seven bowls. He tells us that “these are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:1-66:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 15:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:1-66:16:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16:1</a>) These plagues, revealing Jehovah’s sanctions for wickedness in the earth, must be poured out to a finality. When they are over, God’s judgments will have been executed. Satan’s world will be no more! What do these plagues portend for mankind and the rulers of the present wicked system? How can Christians avoid being plagued along with this doomed world? Vital questions, these, and now they are to be answered. All who long for the triumph of righteousness will have keen interest in what John next sees.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In these last days, many governments have demanded what amounts to worship <span id="page223" class="pageNum" data-no="223" data-before-text="223"></span>from their subjects, insisting that the State must be exalted above God or any other loyalty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:25-42:20:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 20:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:15-43:19:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 19:15</a>.) Since 1914 it has become common for nations to conscript their youth in order for them to fight, or be ready to fight, the kind of total warfare that has so bloodied the pages of modern history. During the Lord’s day, the nations have also produced, as a substitute for God’s Kingdom, the image of the beast​—the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations. What blasphemy to proclaim, as recent popes have done, that this man-made body is the nations’ sole hope for peace! It staunchly opposes God’s Kingdom. Those who worship it become spiritually unclean, ulcerated, just as the Egyptians who opposed Jehovah in Moses’ day were plagued by literal sores and ulcers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:10-2:9:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 9:10, 11</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The contents of this bowl strongly emphasize the choice that lies before humans. They must suffer either the world’s disapproval or Jehovah’s indignation. Mankind has been put under compulsion to accept the mark of the wild beast, with the intent that “nobody might be able to buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:16-66:13:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 13:16, 17</a>) But there is a price to pay for this! Jehovah regards those who accept the mark as being stricken with “a hurtful and malignant ulcer.” Since 1922 they have been marked in public as having rejected the living God. Their political schemes have no success, and they suffer anguish. Spiritually, they are unclean. Unless they repent, this “hurtful” illness will be terminal, for it is now Jehovah’s day of judgment. There is no neutral ground between being a part of the world’s system of things and serving Jehovah on the side of his Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:23-42:11:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 11:23</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The second bowl of God’s anger must now be poured out. What will it mean for mankind? John tells us: <strong><em>“And the second one poured out his bowl into the sea.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 17:14</a>) The pouring out of the second bowl of God’s anger reveals that all of mankind who inhabit this sea are dead in Jehovah’s eyes. By reason of community responsibility, mankind is guilty of gross shedding of innocent blood. When Jehovah’s day of anger arrives, they <span id="page224" class="pageNum" data-no="224" data-before-text="224"></span>will literally die at the hands of his executional forces.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:17-66:19:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:13-51:2:13" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Colossians 2:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The third bowl of God’s anger, like the third trumpet blast, has an effect on freshwater sources. <strong><em>“And the third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>These “rivers and the fountains of the waters” picture the so-called fresh sources of guidance and wisdom accepted by this world, such as the political, economic, scientific, educational, social, and religious philosophies that guide human actions and decisions. Rather than look to Jehovah, the Fountain of life, for life-giving truth, men have ‘hewn out for themselves broken cisterns’ and drunk deeply of “the wisdom of this world [that] is foolishness with God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:13-24:2:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:19-46:1:19" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:6-46:2:6" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:19" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> Psalm 36:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 8. In what ways has mankind incurred bloodguilt?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Such tainted “waters” have led men to become bloodguilty, for example, in encouraging them to shed blood on a monumental scale in wars, which in the last century took more than a hundred million lives. Particularly in Christendom, where the two world wars erupted, have men been “in a hurry to shed innocent blood,” and this has included the blood of God’s own witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:7-23:59:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:34-24:2:34" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 2:34</a>) Mankind has also incurred bloodguilt by its misuse of huge quantities of blood for transfusions, in violation of Jehovah’s righteous laws.

Full retribution for all bloodguilt will come shortly when transgressors pay the supreme <span id="page225" class="pageNum" data-no="225" data-before-text="225"></span>penalty, being trampled in “the great winepress of the anger of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:19-66:14:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 9. What does the pouring out of the third bowl involve?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In Moses’ day, when the Nile River was turned into blood, the Egyptians were able to keep alive by seeking other sources of water. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:24-2:7:24" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 7:24</a>) Today, though, during the spiritual plague, there is nowhere in Satan’s world that people can find life-giving waters. The pouring out of this third bowl involves proclaiming that the world’s “rivers and the fountains of the waters” are as blood, bringing spiritual death to all who imbibe them. Unless people turn to Jehovah, they reap his adverse judgment.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:11-26:33:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezekiel 33:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">10. What does “the angel over the waters” make known, and what testimony does “the altar” add?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>“The angel over the waters,” that is, the angel who pours this bowl into the waters, magnifies Jehovah as the Universal Judge, whose righteous decisions are absolute. Therefore, he says of this judgment: “They deserve it.” Doubtless, the angel personally witnessed much of the bloodshed and cruelty fomented over thousands of years by the false teachings and philosophies of this wicked world. Hence, he knows that Jehovah’s judicial decision is right. Even God’s “altar” speaks out. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:9-66:6:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 6:9, 10</a>, the souls of those who were martyred are said to be at the base of that altar. So “the altar” adds powerful testimony as to the justice and righteousness of Jehovah’s decisions.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Certainly, it is fitting that those who have shed and misused so much blood should themselves be force-fed with blood, in symbol of Jehovah’s sentencing them to death.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The fourth bowl of the anger of God has the sun as its target. John tells us: <strong><em>“And the fourth one poured out his bowl upon the sun; and to the sun it was granted to scorch the men with fire.</em></strong> <strong><em>And the men were scorched with great heat, but they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give glory to him.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:8-66:16:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 16:8,</em></strong> <strong><em>9</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Today, at the conclusion of the system of things, Jesus’ spiritual brothers “shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:40-40:13:40" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 13:40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:43-40:13:43" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 43</a>) Jesus <span id="page226" class="pageNum" data-no="226" data-before-text="226"></span>himself is “the sun of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:4:2-39:4:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Malachi 4:2</a>) Mankind, though, has its own “sun,” its own rulers who try to shine in opposition to God’s Kingdom. The fourth trumpet blast proclaimed that the ‘sun, moon, and stars’ in Christendom’s heavens are really sources of darkness, not light. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:12-66:8:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 8:12</a>) The fourth bowl of God’s anger now shows that the world’s “sun” would get unbearably hot. Those looked to as sunlike leaders would “scorch” mankind. This would be granted to the symbolic sun. In other words, Jehovah would allow this as part of his fiery judgment on mankind. In what way has this scorching taken place?</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">13. In what way have sunlike rulers of this world “scorched” mankind?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>After the first world war, the rulers of this world formed the League of Nations in an effort to solve the problem of world security, but this failed. So other experimental types of rulership were tried, such as Fascism and Nazism. Communism continued to expand. Rather than improve mankind’s lot, the sunlike rulers in these systems began to ‘scorch mankind with great heat.’ Local wars in Spain, Ethiopia, and Manchuria led up to the second world war. Modern history records that Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin as dictators became responsible directly and indirectly for the deaths of tens of millions, including many of their own nationals. <span id="page227" class="pageNum" data-no="227" data-before-text="227"></span>More recently, international or civil conflicts have “scorched” the people of countries such as Vietnam, Kampuchea, Iran, Lebanon, and Ireland, as well as countries in Latin America and Africa. Add to this the ongoing struggle between the superpowers, whose horrendous nuclear weapons are capable of incinerating all mankind. In these last days, humanity has surely been exposed to a scorching “sun,” its unrighteous rulers. The pouring out of the fourth bowl of God’s anger has pinpointed these historic facts, and God’s people have proclaimed them throughout the earth.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">14. What have Jehovah’s Witnesses consistently taught to be the only solution to mankind’s problems, with what response by mankind as a whole?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Jehovah’s Witnesses have consistently taught that the only solution to mankind’s baffling problems is God’s Kingdom, through which Jehovah purposes to sanctify his name.

It does not have a literal throne, any more than the wild beast itself is literal. Mention of a throne, however, shows that the wild beast has exercised royal authority over mankind; this is in harmony with the fact that each of the beast’s horns bears a royal diadem. In fact, “the throne of the wild beast” is the foundation, or source, of that authority.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> The Bible reveals the true situation of the royal authority of the wild beast when it says that “the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) Thus, the pouring out of the bowl upon the throne of the wild beast involves a proclamation revealing the true role that Satan has played and still plays in supporting and promoting the wild beast.</p>

When Satan <span id="page228" class="pageNum" data-no="228" data-before-text="228"></span>tempted Jesus, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a vision and offered “all this authority and the glory of them.” But there was a condition​—Jesus first had to perform an act of worship before Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-7</a>) Can we imagine that the governments of the world receive their authority at a lesser price? Not at all.

The world subscribes to Satan’s unrighteous standards, thus making him its god.

Today, the world’s spiritual darkness has become all too evident as a result of the sounding of the fifth trumpet and the pouring out of the fifth bowl of God’s anger.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>As world ruler, Satan has caused much unhappiness and suffering. Famine, wars, violence, crime, drug abuse, immorality, sexually transmitted diseases, dishonesty, religious hypocrisy​—these and more are the hallmarks of Satan’s system of things. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.) Even so, the public exposure of Satan as the god of this system of things caused pain and embarrassment to those who live by his standards. “They began to gnaw their tongues for their pain,” especially in Christendom. Many resent that the truth exposes their lifestyle. Some find it threatening, and they persecute those who publish it. They reject God’s Kingdom and revile Jehovah’s holy name. Their religiously diseased, ulcerous condition is laid bare, so that they blaspheme the God of heaven. No, they do “not repent of their works.” So we <span id="page229" class="pageNum" data-no="229" data-before-text="229"></span>cannot expect a mass conversion before the end of this system of things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:6-23:32:6" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">20. How do both the sixth trumpet blast and the pouring out of the sixth bowl involve the river Euphrates?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>The sixth trumpet blast heralded the releasing of “the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:14-66:9:14" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Revelation 9:14</a>) Historically, Babylon was the great city that sat on the river Euphrates. And in 1919 the release of the symbolic four angels accompanied a significant fall of Babylon the Great. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:8-66:14:8" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 14:8</a>) It is noteworthy, then, that the sixth bowl of God’s anger also involves the river Euphrates: <strong><em>“And the sixth one poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:12-66:16:12" data-bid="43-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 16:12</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> This too is bad news for Babylon the Great!</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">21, 22. (a) How did the protective waters of the river Euphrates dry up for Babylon in 539 B.C.E.? (b) What are the “waters” that Babylon the Great sits on, and how are these symbolic waters even now drying up?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>In ancient Babylon’s heyday, the abundant waters of the Euphrates were a major part of her defense system. In 539 B.C.E. those waters dried up when they were diverted from their course by the Persian leader Cyrus. Thus, the way was open for Cyrus the Persian and Darius the Mede, the kings from “the rising of the sun” (that is, the east), to enter Babylon and conquer it. In the hour of crisis, the river Euphrates failed in the defense of that great city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:27-23:45:7" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27–45:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:36-24:51:36" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 51:36</a>) Something similar is due to happen to modern Babylon, the worldwide system of false religion.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Babylon the Great “sits on many waters.” According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:1" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:15-66:17:15" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 15</a>, these symbolize “peoples and crowds and nations and tongues”​—hordes of adherents that she has regarded as a protection. But the “waters” are drying up! In Western Europe, where <span id="page230" class="pageNum" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>formerly she had great influence, hundreds of millions have openly ignored religion. In some lands, for many years there was a declared policy to try to destroy the influence of religion. The masses in those lands have not risen up on her behalf. Similarly, when the time comes for Babylon the Great to be destroyed, the dwindling number of her adherents will prove to be no protection at all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:16" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Revelation 17:16</a>) Though she claims a membership of thousands of millions, Babylon the Great will find herself defenseless against “the kings from the rising of the sun.”</p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">23. (a) Who were the kings from “the rising of the sun” in 539 B.C.E.? (b) Who are “the kings from the rising of the sun” during the Lord’s day, and how will they destroy Babylon the Great?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Who are these kings? In 539 B.C.E. they were Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, who were used by Jehovah to conquer the ancient city of Babylon. In this the Lord’s day, the false religious system of Babylon the Great will also be destroyed by human rulers. But again, this will be a divine judgment. Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, “the kings from the rising of the sun,” will have put into the hearts of human rulers the “thought” to turn on Babylon the Great and destroy her utterly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:17" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Revelation 17:16, 17</a>) The pouring out of the sixth bowl proclaims publicly that this judgment is about to be executed!</p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">24. (a) How have the contents of the first six bowls of Jehovah’s anger been publicized, and with what result? (b) Before telling us of the remaining bowl of God’s anger, what does Revelation reveal?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>These first six bowls of Jehovah’s anger carry a sobering message. God’s earthly servants, supported by the angels, have been busy publicizing their contents on an earth-wide scale. In this way, due warning has been served on all sectors of Satan’s world system, and Jehovah has provided individuals an opportunity to turn to righteousness and keep living. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:14-26:33:16" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ezekiel 33:14-16</a>) Still, one more bowl of God’s anger remains. But before telling us about it, Revelation reveals how Satan and his earthly agents are trying to counteract the publicizing of Jehovah’s judgments.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>The Gathering to Armageddon</strong></p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">25. (a) What does John tell us about unclean, froglike “inspired expressions”? (b) How has there been a disgusting froglike visitation of “unclean inspired expressions” in the Lord’s day, and with what result?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>John tells us: <strong><em>“And I saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</em></strong> <strong><em>They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="49-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 16:13,</em></strong> <strong><em>14</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>In Moses’ day, Jehovah brought a loathsome plague of frogs on Pharaoh’s Egypt, so that “the land began to stink.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:5-2:8:15" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Exodus 8:5-15</a>) During the Lord’s day, there has also been a disgusting froglike visitation, though from a different source. It consists of Satan’s “unclean inspired expressions,” clearly symbolizing propaganda designed to maneuver all human rulers, “kings,” into opposition to Jehovah God. Satan thus makes sure that they are not swayed by the pouring out of the bowls of God’s anger but are firmly on Satan’s side when “the war of the great day of God the Almighty” begins.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">26. (a) From what three sources does satanic propaganda come? (b) What is “the false prophet,” and how do we know?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>The propaganda comes from “the dragon” (Satan) and “the wild beast” (Satan’s earthly political setup), creatures that we have already met up with in Revelation. What, though, is “the false prophet”? This is a newcomer in name only. Previously, we were shown a wild beast with two horns like a lamb that performed great signs before the seven-headed wild beast. This deceptive creature acted like a prophet for that wild beast. It promoted worship of the wild beast, <span id="page231" class="pageNum" data-no="231" data-before-text="231"></span>even causing an image to be built to it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:11-66:13:14" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Revelation 13:11-14</a>) This wild beast with two horns like a lamb must be the same as “the false prophet” mentioned here. Confirming this, we read later that the false prophet, like the symbolic wild beast with two horns, “performed in front of [the seven-headed wild beast] the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who render worship to its image.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:20-66:19:20" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Revelation 19:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">27. (a) What timely warning does Jesus Christ himself give? (b) What warning did Jesus give when he was on the earth? (c) How did the apostle Paul echo Jesus’ warning?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>With so much satanic propaganda around, the next words that John records are indeed timely: <strong><em>“Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:15-66:16:15" data-bid="53-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 16:15</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> Who is coming “as a thief”? Jesus himself, coming at an unannounced time as Jehovah’s Executioner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:3-66:3:3" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Revelation 3:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:10" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:10</a>) While still on earth, Jesus also likened his coming to that of a thief, saying: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. On this account you too prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:37-42:12:37" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> Luke 12:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:40-42:12:40" data-bid="55-4" class="b"> 40</a>) Echoing this warning, the apostle Paul said: “Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night. Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.” Satan is behind any such false proclamation of “Peace and security!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:2-52:5:3" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="qu">28. What warning did Jesus give about resisting worldly pressures, and what is “that day” that Christians do not want to be upon them “as a snare”?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><span id="page232" class="pageNum" data-no="232" data-before-text="232"></span><sup>28 </sup>Jesus also warned of the kind of pressures that this world, saturated with propaganda, would put on Christians. He said: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. . . . Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Luke 21:34-36</a>) “That day” is “the great day of God the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14</a>) As “that day” of the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty approaches, it becomes ever more difficult to cope with the anxieties of life. Christians need to be alert and watchful, staying awake until that day arrives.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">29, 30. (a) What is implied by Jesus’ warning that those found sleeping would be shamed by losing their “outer garments”? (b) What do outer garments identify the wearer as being? (c) How might a person lose his symbolic outer garments, and with what result?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>What, though, is implied by the warning that those found sleeping would be shamed by losing their “outer garments”? In ancient Israel, any priest or Levite on guard duty at the temple had a heavy responsibility. Jewish commentators tell us that if anyone was caught sleeping on such duty, his garments could be stripped from him and burned, so that he was publicly shamed.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>Jesus here warns that something similar can happen today. The priests and Levites foreshadowed Jesus’ anointed brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9</a>) But Jesus’ warning applies by extension to the great crowd too. The outer garments here referred to identify the wearer as a Christian Witness of Jehovah. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:18-66:3:18" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Revelation 3:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 7:14</a>.) If any allow the pressures of Satan’s world to lull them to sleep or into inactivity, they are likely to lose these outer garments​—in other words, lose their clean identification as Christians. Such a situation would be shameful. It would put one in danger of losing out completely.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">31. (a) How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Revelation 16:16</a> stress the need for Christians to stay awake? (b) What speculation have some religious leaders made regarding Armageddon?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>The need for Christians to stay awake becomes even more pressing as the next verse of Revelation comes closer to fulfillment: <strong><em>“And they </em></strong>[the expressions inspired by demons] <strong><em>gathered them </em></strong>[the earthly kings, or rulers] <strong><em>together to the place that is called in Hebrew Har–Magedon.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="61-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 16:16</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>This name, more commonly rendered Armageddon, occurs only once in the Bible. But it has fired mankind’s imagination. World leaders have warned of a possible nuclear Armageddon. Armageddon has been linked also with the ancient city of Megiddo, the site of many decisive battles in Bible times, and some religious leaders have therefore speculated that the final war on earth will take place in that limited area. In this, they are far wide of the truth.</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">32, 33. (a) Rather than being a literal place, what does the name Har–Magedon, or Armageddon, represent?

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><sup>32 </sup>The name Har–Magedon means “Mountain of Megiddo.” But rather than being a literal place, it represents the world situation into which all nations are gathered in opposition to Jehovah God and where he will finally destroy them.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" data-rel-pid="[88]" class="sb"><sup>35 </sup>“The air” is the final life-sustaining medium to be plagued. But this is not the literal air. There is nothing about the literal air that makes it deserving of Jehovah’s adverse judgments, any more than the literal earth, sea, freshwater sources, or sun deserve to suffer judgments at Jehovah’s hand. Rather, this is “the air” Paul was discussing when he called Satan “the ruler of the authority of the air.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2</a>) It is the satanic “air” <span id="page234" class="pageNum" data-no="234" data-before-text="234"></span>breathed by the world today, the spirit, or general mental inclination, that characterizes his whole wicked system of things, the satanic thinking that permeates every aspect of life outside Jehovah’s organization.

<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">36. (a) What do the seven plagues constitute? (b) What is indicated by Jehovah’s proclamation: “It has come to pass!”?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><sup>36 </sup>This and the previous six plagues give the sum total of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan and his system.

<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">37. How does John describe what takes place after the pouring out of the seventh bowl of the anger of God?</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><sup>38 </sup>Once again, Jehovah acts unmistakably toward mankind, this being signaled by “lightnings and voices and thunders.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:5-66:4:5" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Revelation 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:5-66:8:5" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 8:5</a>.)

This blockbuster shaking will shatter “the great city,” Babylon the Great, so that it splits into “three parts”​—symbolic of its collapse into unredeemable ruin. Also, “the cities of the nations” will fall. “Every island” and “mountains”​—institutions and organizations that seem so permanent in this system—​will go. “A great hail,” much greater than that which afflicted Egypt during the seventh plague, with each hailstone weighing about a talent, will pummel mankind painfully.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:22-2:9:26" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Exodus 9:22-26</a>) This punishing downpour of congealed waters likely pictures unusually heavy verbal expressions of Jehovah’s judgments, signaling that the end of this system of things has arrived at last!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:11:9-2:11:10" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Exodus 11:9, 10</a>) There will be no last-minute, large-scale change of heart. With their dying breath, they will rail against the God who declares: “They will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:23-26:38:23" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:23</a>) Nevertheless, the sovereignty of Jehovah God the Almighty will have been vindicated.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 1. What does one of the seven angels reveal to John?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S righteous anger must be poured out to completion, seven bowls of it! When the sixth angel emptied his bowl at the location of ancient Babylon, it fittingly symbolized the plaguing of Babylon the Great as events move swiftly toward the final war of Armageddon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:1-66:16:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:12-66:16:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 16</a>) Likely, it is this same angel that now reveals why and how Jehovah executes his righteous judgments. John is struck with wonderment at what he next hears and sees: <strong><em>“And one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: ‘Come, I will show you the judgment upon the great harlot who sits on many waters, </em></strong><strong><em>with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, whereas those who inhabit the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.’”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 17:1, 2</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 2. What evidence is there that “the great harlot” (a) is not ancient Rome? (b) is not big business? (c) is a religious entity?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>“The great harlot”! Why so shocking a designation? Who is she? Some have identified this symbolic harlot with ancient Rome. But Rome was a political power. This harlot commits fornication with the kings of the earth, and this evidently includes the kings of Rome. Besides, after her destruction, “the kings of the earth” are said to mourn her passing. Therefore, she cannot be a political power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:9-66:18:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 18:9, 10</a>) Additionally, since she is mourned also by the world’s merchants, she could not picture big business. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:15-66:18:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 18:15, 16</a>) We read, however, that ‘by her spiritistic practice all the nations were misled.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:23-66:18:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 18:23</a>) This makes it clear that the great harlot must be a worldwide religious entity.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 3. (a) Why must the great harlot symbolize more than the Roman Catholic Church or even all of Christendom? (b) What Babylonish doctrines are to be found in most Oriental religions as well as in the sects of Christendom? (c) What did Roman Catholic cardinal John Henry Newman admit regarding the origin of many of Christendom’s doctrines, ceremonies, and practices? (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Which religious entity? Is she the Roman Catholic Church, as some have maintained? Or is she all of Christendom? No, she must be even larger than these if she is to mislead all the nations. She is, in fact, the entire world empire of false religion. Her origin in the mysteries of Babylon is shown in that many Babylonish doctrines and practices are common to religions around the earth. For example, belief in the inherent immortality of the human soul, in a hell of torment, and in a trinity of gods is to be found in most Oriental religions as well as in the sects of Christendom. False religion, spawned more than 4,000 years ago in the ancient city of Babylon, has developed into the modern <span id="page236" class="pageNum" data-no="236" data-before-text="236"></span>monstrosity that is called, appropriately, Babylon the Great.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Why, though, is she described by the repugnant term “the great harlot”?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 4. (a) In what ways did ancient Israel commit fornication? (b) In what outstanding way has Babylon the Great committed fornication?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Babylon (or Babel, meaning “Confusion”) came to its peak of greatness in Nebuchadnezzar’s time. It was a religio-political state with more than a thousand temples and chapels. Its priesthood exercised great power. Though Babylon has long since ceased to exist as a world power, religious Babylon the Great lives on, and after the ancient pattern, she still seeks to influence and mold political affairs. But does God approve of religion in politics? In the Hebrew Scriptures, Israel was said to prostitute herself when she got involved with false worship and when, instead of trusting in Jehovah, she made alliances with the nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:6-24:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:8-24:3:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:28-26:16:30" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 16:28-30</a>) Babylon the Great also commits fornication.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 5. (a) What limelight do religious clergymen enjoy? (b) Why is a desire for worldly prominence a direct contradiction of the words of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span id="page237" class="pageNum" data-no="237" data-before-text="237"></span><sup>5 </sup>Today, religious leaders frequently campaign for high government office, and in some lands, they share in government, even holding cabinet posts. In 1988 two well-known Protestant clergymen ran for the office of president of the United States. Leaders in Babylon the Great love the limelight; their photos are often to be seen in the public press as they consort with prominent politicians. In contrast, Jesus shunned political involvement and said of his disciples: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:15-43:6:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Matthew 4:8-10</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Modern-Day ‘Harlotry’</strong></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">6, 7. (a) How did Hitler’s Nazi Party come to power in Germany? (b) How did the concordat that the Vatican made with Nazi Germany help Hitler in his push for world domination?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Through her meddling in politics, the great harlot has brought untold sorrow to mankind. Consider, for example, the facts behind Hitler’s rise to power in Germany​—ugly facts that some would like to expunge from the history books. In May 1924 the Nazi Party held 32 seats in the German Reichstag. By May 1928 these had dwindled to 12 seats. However, the Great Depression engulfed the world in 1930; riding in its wake, the Nazis made a remarkable recovery, gaining 230 out of 608 seats in the German elections of July 1932. Soon after, former chancellor Franz von Papen, a Papal Knight, came to the Nazis’ aid. According to historians, von Papen envisioned a new Holy Roman Empire. His own short tenure as chancellor had been a failure, so now he hoped to gain power through the Nazis. By January 1933, he had mustered support for Hitler from the industrial barons, and through wily intrigues he ensured that Hitler became Germany’s chancellor on January 30, 1933. He himself was made vice-chancellor and was used by Hitler to win the support of Catholic sections of Germany. Within two months of gaining power, Hitler dissolved parliament, dispatched thousands of opposition leaders to concentration camps, and began an open campaign of oppressing the Jews.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>On July 20, 1933, the Vatican’s interest in the rising power of Nazism was displayed when Cardinal Pacelli (who later became Pope Pius XII) signed a concordat in Rome between the Vatican and Nazi Germany. Von Papen signed the document as Hitler’s representative, and Pacelli there conferred on von Papen the high papal decoration of the Grand Cross of the Order of Pius.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> In his book <em>Satan in Top Hat, </em>Tibor Koeves writes of this, stating: “The Concordat was a great victory for Hitler. It gave him the first moral support he had <span id="page238" class="pageNum" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>received from the outer world, and this from the most exalted source.” The concordat required the Vatican to withdraw its support from Germany’s Catholic Center Party, thus sanctioning Hitler’s one-party “total state.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Further, its article 14 stated: “The appointments for archbishops, bishops, and the like will be issued only after the governor, installed by the Reich, has duly ascertained that no doubts exist with respect to general political considerations.” By the end of 1933 (proclaimed a “Holy Year” by Pope Pius XI), Vatican support had become a major factor in Hitler’s push for world domination.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">8, 9. (a) How did the Vatican as well as the Catholic Church and its clergy react to the Nazi tyranny? (b) What statement did the German Catholic bishops issue at the start of World War II? (c) In what have religio-political relationships resulted?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Though a handful of priests and nuns protested Hitler’s atrocities​—and suffered for it—​the Vatican as well as the Catholic Church and its army of clergy gave either active or tacit support to the Nazi tyranny, which they regarded as a bulwark against the advance of world Communism. Sitting pretty in the Vatican, Pope Pius XII let the Holocaust on the Jews and the cruel persecutions of Jehovah’s Witnesses and others proceed uncriticized. It is ironical that Pope John Paul II, on visiting Germany in May 1987, should glorify the anti-Nazi stand of one sincere priest. What were the other thousands of the German clergy doing during Hitler’s reign of terror? A pastoral letter issued by the German Catholic bishops in September 1939 at the outbreak of World War II provides enlightenment on this point. It reads in part: “In this decisive hour we admonish our Catholic soldiers to do their duty in obedience to the Fuehrer and to be ready to sacrifice their whole individuality. We appeal to the Faithful to join in ardent prayers that Divine Providence may lead this war to blessed success.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Such Catholic diplomacy illustrates the kind of harlotry that religion has engaged in over the past 4,000 years in wooing the political State in order to gain power and advantage. Such religio-political relationships have fostered warfare, persecutions, and human misery on a vast scale. How happy mankind can be that Jehovah’s judgment upon the great harlot is at hand. May it soon be executed!</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Sitting on Many Waters</strong></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">10. What are the “many waters” that Babylon the Great looks to for protection, and what is happening to them?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Ancient Babylon sat on many waters​—the Euphrates River and numerous canals. These were a protection to her as well as a source of commerce producing wealth, until they dried up in one night. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:38-24:50:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 50:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:9-24:51:9" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 51:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:12-24:51:13" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>) Babylon the Great also <span id="page239" class="pageNum" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>looks to “many waters” to protect and enrich her. These symbolic waters are “peoples and crowds and nations and tongues,” that is, all the thousands of millions of humans over whom she has dominated and from whom she has drawn material support. But these waters are also drying up, or withdrawing support.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:15-66:17:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 17:15</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:4-19:18:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 18:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:7-23:8:7" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Isaiah 8:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">11. (a) How did ancient Babylon ‘make all the earth drunk’? (b) How has Babylon the Great ‘made all the earth drunk’?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Further, Babylon of old was described as “a golden cup in the hand of Jehovah, she making all the earth drunk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:7-24:51:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:7</a>) Ancient Babylon forced neighboring nations to swallow expressions of Jehovah’s anger when she conquered them <span id="page240" class="pageNum" data-no="240" data-before-text="240"></span>militarily, making them as weak as drunken men. In that respect, she was Jehovah’s instrument. Babylon the Great, too, has made conquests to the point of becoming a worldwide empire. But she is certainly not God’s instrument. Rather, she has served “the kings of the earth” with whom she commits religious fornication. She has gratified these kings by using her lying doctrines and enslaving practices to keep the masses of the people, “those who inhabit the earth,” weak as drunken men, passively subservient to their rulers.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">12. (a) How was a segment of Babylon the Great in Japan responsible for much bloodshed during World War II? (b) How were “waters” in support of Babylon the Great withdrawn in Japan, and with what result?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Shinto Japan provides a notable example of this. The indoctrinated Japanese soldier regarded it as the highest honor to give his life for the emperor​—the supreme Shinto god. During World War II, some 1,500,000 Japanese soldiers died in battle; almost to a man, they looked at surrender as dishonorable. But as a consequence of Japan’s defeat, Emperor Hirohito was compelled to renounce his claim to divinity. This resulted in a notable withdrawing of the “waters” supporting the Shinto segment of Babylon the Great​—alas, after Shintoism had sanctioned the shedding of buckets of blood in the Pacific war theater! This weakening of Shinto influence also opened the way in recent years for more than 200,000 Japanese, the great majority of whom were formerly Shintoists and Buddhists, to become dedicated, baptized ministers of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>The Harlot Rides a Beast</strong></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">13. What amazing sight does John see when the angel carries him in the power of the spirit into a wilderness?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>What more does the prophecy disclose as to the great harlot and her fate? As John now relates, a further vivid scene comes to view: <strong><em>“And he </em></strong>[the angel] <strong><em>carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. And I caught sight of a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 17:3</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">14. Why is it fitting that John was carried into a wilderness?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Why is John carried into a wilderness? An earlier pronouncement of doom against ancient Babylon was described as being “against the wilderness of the sea.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:1-23:21:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:9-23:21:9" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9</a>) This gave due warning that, despite all its watery defenses, ancient Babylon would become a lifeless desolation. It is fitting, then, that John should be carried in his vision to a wilderness to see the fate of Babylon the Great. She too must become desolate and waste. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:19-66:18:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 18:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:22-66:18:23" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 22, 23</a>) John is amazed, though, by what he sees out there. The great harlot is not alone! She is sitting on a monstrous wild beast!</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">15. What differences are there between the wild beast of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:1" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1</a> and that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 17:3</a>?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>This wild beast has seven heads and ten horns. Is it, then, the same as the wild beast that John saw earlier, which also has seven heads and ten horns? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1</a>) No, there are differences. This wild beast is scarlet-colored and, unlike the previous wild beast, is not said to have diadems. Rather than having blasphemous names on its seven heads <em>only, </em>it is <em>“full </em>of blasphemous names.” Nevertheless, there must be a relationship between this new wild beast and the previous one; the similarities between them are too pronounced to be coincidental.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">16. What is the identity of the scarlet-colored wild beast, and what has been stated as to its purpose?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>What, then, is this new scarlet-colored wild beast? It must be the image to the wild beast that was brought forth under the urging of the Anglo-American wild beast that has two horns like a lamb. After the image was made, that two-horned wild beast was allowed to give breath to the image of the <span id="page241" class="pageNum" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>wild beast. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:14-66:13:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 13:14, 15</a>) John now sees the living, breathing image. It pictures the League of Nations organization that the two-horned wild beast brought to life in 1920. U.S. President Wilson had envisioned that the League “would be a forum for the dispensation of justice for all men and wipe out the threat of war forever.” When it was resurrected after the second world war as the United Nations, its chartered purpose was “to maintain international peace and security.”</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">17. (a) In what way is the symbolic scarlet-colored wild beast full of blasphemous names? (b) Who is riding the scarlet-colored wild beast? (c) How did Babylonish religion link itself with the League of Nations and its successor right from the beginning?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>In what way is this symbolic wild beast full of blasphemous names? In that men have set up this multinational idol as a substitute for God’s Kingdom​—to accomplish what God says his Kingdom alone can accomplish.

True to the prophecy, Babylonish religion, particularly in Christendom, has linked itself with the League of Nations and its successor. As early as December 18, 1918, the body now known as the National Council of the Churches of Christ in America adopted a declaration that declared in part: “Such a League is not a mere political expedient; it is rather the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth. . . . The Church can give a spirit of good-will, without which no League of Nations can endure. . . . The League of Nations is rooted in the Gospel. Like the Gospel, its objective is ‘peace on earth, good-will toward men.’”</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">18. How did Christendom’s clergy show their support for the League of Nations?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>On January 2, 1919, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle </em>carried the front-page headline: “Pope Pleads for Adoption of Wilson’s League of Nations.” On October 16, 1919, a petition signed by 14,450 clergymen of leading denominations was presented to the U.S. Senate, urging that body “to ratify the Paris peace treaty embodying the league of nations covenant.” Though the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the treaty, Christendom’s clergy continued to campaign for the League. And how was the League inaugurated? A news dispatch from Switzerland, dated November 15, 1920, read: “Opening of the first assembly of the League of Nations was announced <span id="page243" class="pageNum" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span>at eleven o’clock this morning by the ringing of all the church bells in Geneva.”</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">19. When the scarlet-colored wild beast made its appearance, what course of action did the John class take?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Did the John class, the one group on earth that eagerly accepted the incoming Messianic Kingdom, share with Christendom in paying homage to the scarlet-colored wild beast? Far from it! On Sunday, September 7, 1919, the convention of Jehovah’s people in Cedar Point, Ohio, featured the public talk “The Hope for Distressed Humanity.” On the following day, the Sandusky <em>Star-Journal </em>reported that J. F. Rutherford, in addressing nearly 7,000 persons, had “asserted that the Lord’s displeasure is certain to be visited upon the League . . . because the clergy​—Catholic and Protestant—​claiming to be God’s representatives, have abandoned his plan and endorsed the League of Nations, hailing it as a political expression of Christ’s kingdom on earth.”</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">20. Why was it blasphemous for the clergy to hail the League of Nations as “the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth”?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>The dismal failure of the League of Nations should have signaled to the clergy that such man-made organs are no part of a Kingdom of God on earth. What blasphemy to make such a claim! It makes it seem as though God was a party to the colossal botch that the League turned out to be. As for God, “perfect is his activity.” Jehovah’s heavenly Kingdom under Christ​—and not a combine of squabbling politicians, many of them atheists—​is the means by which he will bring in peace and have his will done on earth as in heaven.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>What of the League’s successor, the United Nations? From its inception, this body has also had the great harlot riding on its back, visibly associated with it and trying to guide its destiny. For example, on its 20th anniversary, in June 1965, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, together with Protestants, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Muslims​—said to represent two thousand million of earth’s population—​assembled in San Francisco to celebrate their support and admiration of the UN. On visiting the UN in October 1965, Pope Paul VI described it as “that greatest of all international organizations” and added: “The peoples of the earth turn to the United Nations as the last hope of concord and peace.” Another papal visitor, Pope John Paul II, addressing the UN in October 1979, said: “I hope the United Nations will ever remain the supreme forum of peace and justice.” Significantly, the pope gave very little attention to Jesus Christ or to God’s Kingdom in his speech.

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">22. (a) What kind of beast has the great harlot chosen to ride? (b) How does John describe the symbolic harlot Babylon the Great?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>The apostle John is soon to learn that the great harlot has chosen a dangerous beast to ride. First, though, his attention turns to Babylon the Great herself. She is richly adorned, but, oh, how repulsive she is! <strong><em>“And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and was adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls and had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her fornication.</em></strong> <strong><em>And upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery: ‘Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.’</em></strong> <strong><em>And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:4-66:17:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 17:4</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong><strong><em>6a</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">23. What is the full name of Babylon the Great, and what is its significance?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>As was the custom in ancient Rome, this prostitute is identified by the name on her <span id="page244" class="pageNum" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>forehead.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> It is a long name: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” That name is “a mystery,” something with hidden meaning. But in God’s due time, the mystery is to be explained. In fact, the angel gives John enough information to allow Jehovah’s servants today to discern the full significance of this descriptive name. We recognize Babylon the Great as being all of false religion. She is “the mother of the harlots” because all the individual false religions in the world, including the many sects in Christendom, are like her daughters, imitating her in committing spiritual harlotry. She is also the mother of “disgusting things” in that she has given birth to such revolting offspring as idolatry, spiritism, fortune-telling, astrology, palmistry, human sacrifice, temple prostitution, drunkenness in honor of false gods, and other obscene practices.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">24. Why is it appropriate that Babylon the Great is seen to be dressed in “purple and scarlet” and is “adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls”?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Babylon the Great is dressed in “purple and scarlet,” the colors of royalty, and is “adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls.” How appropriate! Just reflect on all the magnificent buildings, rare statues and paintings, priceless icons, and other religious paraphernalia, as well as astronomical amounts of property and cash, that this world’s religions have accumulated. Whether at the Vatican, in the TV empire of evangelism centered in the United States, or in the exotic wats and temples of the Orient, Babylon the Great has amassed​—and at times lost—​fabulous wealth.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">25. (a) What is symbolized by the contents of the “golden cup that was full of disgusting things?” (b) In what sense is the symbolic harlot drunk?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Look now at what the harlot has in her hand. John must have gasped at the sight of it​—a golden cup “full of disgusting things <span id="page245" class="pageNum" data-no="245" data-before-text="245"></span>and the unclean things of her fornication”! This is the cup containing “the wine of the anger of her fornication” with which she has made all the nations drunk. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:8-66:14:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 14:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:4-66:17:4" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 17:4</a>) It looks rich on the outside, but its contents are disgusting, unclean. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:25-40:23:26" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 23:25, 26</a>.) It contains all the filthy practices and lies that the great harlot has used to seduce the nations and bring them under her influence. Even more revolting, John sees that the harlot herself is inebriated, drunk with the blood of God’s servants! In fact, we later read that “in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 18:24</a>) What massive bloodguilt!</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">26. What evidence is there of bloodguilt on the part of Babylon the Great?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Over the centuries, the world empire of false religion has shed oceans of blood. For example, in medieval Japan, temples in Kyoto were transformed into fortresses, and warrior-monks, invoking “the holy name of Buddha,” battled one another until the streets ran red with blood. In the 20th century, the clergy of Christendom marched with the armies of their respective countries, and these slaughtered one another, with the loss of at least a hundred million lives. In October 1987 former U.S. president Nixon said: “The 20th century has been the bloodiest in history. More people have been killed in the wars of this century than in all the wars fought before the century began.” The religions of the world are judged adversely by God for their share in all of this; Jehovah detests “hands that are shedding innocent blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16, 17</a>) Earlier, John heard a cry from the altar: “Until when, Sovereign Lord holy and true, are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:10-66:6:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 6:10</a>) Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth, will be deeply involved when the time comes to answer that question.</p>

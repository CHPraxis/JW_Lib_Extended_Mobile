<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Beginning with the March 1, 1988, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>the <em>Watchtower </em>Study schedule that appears on page 2 of each issue will be adjusted so as to indicate weeks beginning on Monday instead of Sunday. According to this arrangement, material assigned for the week of March 28 will be considered on April 3 by congregations that have their <em>Watchtower </em>Study on Sunday.</p>

“A Word Spoken at the Right Time”
“As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it,” says Proverbs 25:11. Our thoughtful words and kind deeds can gently nudge a righteous person’s heart along the pathway of Jehovah’s approval. Something that we may have said or done, even years ago, may still be fondly remembered by another person. For example, while visiting a congregation, a circuit overseer and his wife were the guests of a newly baptized sister. The circuit overseer’s wife sent a thank-you note in appreciation for the hospitality shown. More than seven years later, she received the following letter:
“I felt I just had to write and tell you of the help you have been to me over the years without your really being aware of it. I had you and Jim over for just a little lunch, and you sent me a very nice thank-you card. It was very warm, but it was the scripture that reached my heart, and I never forgot it. This was in 1976. I was the only one in my family that really was interested in the truth. I studied with my girls and tried to be a good wife. But at times I wanted out, out of the truth, out of the responsibilities​—just out. But that scripture you wrote would tug at my heart, and I would say to myself, ‘How selfish of me,’ and keep going.
“No single thing in all those eight years had such an effect on me, and I wanted to tell you about it. Besides the scripture, I thought how nice it was that someone as busy as you would take the time to thank me for doing something that I should be doing.
“Oh, yes​—the scripture—​2 John 8.
“Sandra”
Today, Sandra’s husband is baptized and joins her as a publisher of the good news. One of their two daughters is a regular pioneer, and the other daughter has been auxiliary pioneering since her recent graduation from high school.
Finally, what does 2 John 8 say? “Look out for yourselves, that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward.”

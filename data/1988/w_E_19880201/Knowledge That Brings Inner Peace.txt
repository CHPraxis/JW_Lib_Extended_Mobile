Knowledge That Brings Inner Peace
A young woman from Ohio, U.S.A., writes: “I was raised a Catholic, attended a Methodist church while in college, dated a Jewish boy, then married a Lutheran. I was never happy with any of these religions that kept ‘changing with the times.’ I began reading the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, hesitantly at first and admiring the beautiful illustrations. I became engrossed and fervently read the last half in four hours.”
The woman now says she thanks God “for my new knowledge and inner peace.” We feel that you too can benefit from this faith-strengthening publication. It discusses practically every controversial Bible teaching, gathering the evidence together in such a concise and understandable way that the answer becomes clear to the reader. The book’s 256 pages, the same page size as this magazine, are filled with over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. Only $2.50.
Please send, postpaid, You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

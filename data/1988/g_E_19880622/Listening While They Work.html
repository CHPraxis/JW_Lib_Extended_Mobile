<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE owner of a clothing store told a customer of her intention to buy some Bible tapes. The customer recommended tapes of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>The store owner asked if one of the tapes could be loaned to her so she could hear how it sounded.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, after listening to the tape, the store owner requested: “Please order the set from Matthew to Revelation, and,” she added, “tell whoever is in charge of producing them that the diction is the best I’ve heard.” The woman explained that she and her daughters listened to the tape when doing work at the store and that they all were very pleased with it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You too can benefit from these Bible tapes. The album, complete with the entire “New Testament” from Matthew to Revelation (18 cassettes), is $30. Two albums of the “Old Testament” are also available, the first has Genesis to Ruth on 18 cassettes and is $30; the second album has 21 cassettes containing First Samuel through Psalms and is $33.25.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Neighbors used to complain about the music played through the loudspeaker system at a junior high school in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Then a youth took the <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>cassettes to school. After listening to them, the teacher said: “This is good music. You may play the tapes over the school loudspeaker system.” Since then the students, teachers, and even the neighbors have been listening to the <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>for 10 minutes every morning and 25 minutes during lunch breaks. And there have been no further complaints about the music!</p>

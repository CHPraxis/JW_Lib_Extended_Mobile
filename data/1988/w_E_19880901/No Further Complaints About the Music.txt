No Further Complaints About the Music
Neighbors used to complain about the music played through the loudspeaker system at a junior high school in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Then a youth took the Kingdom Melodies cassettes to school. After listening to them, the teacher said: “This is good music. You may play the tapes over the school loudspeaker system.” Since then the students, teachers, and even the neighbors have been listening to the Kingdom Melodies for 10 minutes every morning and 25 minutes during lunch breaks. And there have been no further complaints about the music!

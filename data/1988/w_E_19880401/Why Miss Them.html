<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While standing in line in a New York City bank last summer, a middle-aged woman noted that the man in front of her was reading the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. She was quite anxious to read the article in it on prayer, so she took note of the issue date.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A few days later, Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her home, and she asked: “Do you have the July issues of <em>The Watchtower?” </em>After learning why she was interested in a particular magazine, one of the Witnesses noted: “The best way not to miss any interesting issues is to subscribe.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I didn’t know you could!” the woman exclaimed. When told the year’s subscription was $5, she answered: “Are you sure? Only $5 for the <em>whole </em>year?” When assured that it was, she wanted not only <em>The Watchtower </em>but its companion magazine <em>Awake! </em>as well. “Are you sure I can get both magazines for just $10?” she asked again.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The woman was pleased to have the Witness subscribe for her. You too can have the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines delivered to your home. Send only $10, and you will receive both these magazines (four copies a month) for one year.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>I enclose $10 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>□ What is the theme of modern-day Biblical evangelism?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">The core of the true evangelizer’s message today is the good news of God’s Kingdom in the hands of his appointed Ruler, Jesus Christ. It includes all the truths Jesus spoke and that his disciples recorded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>)​—1/1, page 4.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>□ Why is it necessary to continue preaching the good news in territories where there is little or no result?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, has commanded that ‘the good news be preached in all the inhabited earth.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) When people refuse to listen, this gives us an opportunity to show the depth of our love and devotion to Jehovah by persistently doing what is right. Also, our love moves us to warn our neighbors as to what the future holds for mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 4:2</a>)​—1/1, page 26.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>□ To what direction and purpose of God did all Bible writers point in spite of their differences in presentation?</strong></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">A climate of trust and confidence is developed, leading to healthy attitudes and relationships.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>□ Whose prayers does the almighty God hear and answer?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">Jehovah hears prayers offered to him through the right channel, Jesus Christ; in the right manner; and with the right attitude of mind and heart. God answers such prayers according to his divine will and at his chosen time.​—3/15, page 7.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2:1-9</a>)​—3/15, pages 28, 29.</p>

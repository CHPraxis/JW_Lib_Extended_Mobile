<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I met a woman from Poland who is a professor,” reports a missionary in Senegal, Africa. “We had a long discussion, and I endeavored to answer her many questions.” The professor refused a publication designed for Bible study, explaining: “I am an atheist. That book does not interest me at all.” However, she did accept the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I returned the following week,” the missionary reports, “she excitedly told me that she had read the book from cover to cover. When I proposed examining the <em>Creation </em>book with her, she replied: ‘But I have no need to study <em>that </em>book now! I have read it entirely, and it has completely changed my mind​—I’m no longer an atheist! Now I would like for you to study that red book you first showed me, along with the Bible!’”</p>

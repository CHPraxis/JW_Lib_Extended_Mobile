April 1, 1988​—A Day to Remember
The evening before he died, Jesus shared a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of wine with his apostles and said, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
This year the anniversary of his command falls on April 1, after sunset.
As a result, Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathered this special night to repeat this Memorial in the manner Jesus requested. You are most warmly invited to join us as observers. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.

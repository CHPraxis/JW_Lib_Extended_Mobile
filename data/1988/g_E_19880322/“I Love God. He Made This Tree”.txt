“I Love God. He Made This Tree”
Many see trees and see money. This two-year-old sees this tree and loves God. As she grows older, she will see more and love God even more. Here’s some inside information on the tree trunk she’s hugging.
It’s loaded with “pipelines.” Some go from roots to leaves, others from leaves to roots. The ones going up are in the sapwood. They carry water and minerals to every leaf on the tree. The ones going down are just under the bark. They carry food from leaves to roots.
The tip of each rootlet has a hard, lubricated cap and pushes its way through the soil, spiraling like a corkscrew as it goes. Just behind the tip are hundreds of root hairs that absorb water and minerals. This water can travel up hundreds of feet to the highest leaf on the tallest tree.
The leaf takes carbon dioxide from the air and energy from the sun, and with the water and minerals from the roots, it makes food for the plant. The food “pipelines” transport it to every cell in the tree. The leaf’s power to do this is not understood. It has been called a miracle.
That’s just part of what’s happening in the tree trunk our young tree-lover is hugging.
Now she is seven. She has expanded her view to take in the whole tree​—leaves and roots as well as trunk. She still loves God, she still sees Him as the tree’s Maker, and she thereby sees more than the worldly wise.​—Romans 1:20; 1 Corinthians 3:19, 20.

A Case for Creation
A young woman who had attended college in Iowa, U.S.A., writes regarding one of her teachers: “I could remember her way of teaching about the human anatomy and physiology of the body. She strongly believed in a Creator, but yet the questions of evolution would be asked by students.”
When this former student received a copy of the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? she thought of her teacher and sent her a copy. The teacher wrote back:
“I’m about halfway through the book, and as I suspected, it is exactly the type of reference material I have often wished I had to back up my beliefs. In my opinion, it is excellent! Very well presented plus very well documented. All the research I have often wished I had time for or an inclination to do has been done for me! Also, it pleases me that you knew it is the type of book I would want to have. Thank you very much!”

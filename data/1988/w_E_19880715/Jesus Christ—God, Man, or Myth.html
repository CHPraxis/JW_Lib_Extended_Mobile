<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A ROCK musical that opened on Broadway in New York City in 1971 proved to be controversial, dealing as it did with a religious subject. But probably the subject was no more controversial than was the identity of its main character.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of this musical’s hit songs asked: “Jesus Christ Superstar, do you think you’re what they say you are?” Who did people back in the first century say Jesus was? Jesus himself asked his disciples that question and received several different answers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:13-40:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 16:13, 14</a>) Today, almost 2,000 years later, the identity of Jesus Christ is still controversial.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Does it really matter who Jesus was? What effect can his identity have on us? Well, prominent people of bygone days shaped world history, thus affecting all of us, if only indirectly. But today they are dead. Thus, although they have affected us by what they did, in no way can they affect us by what they are doing.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the case of Jesus Christ, however, the situation is entirely different. Millions believe, and have conclusive evidence for such belief, that Jesus is very much alive today, not as a human on earth but as a powerful spirit in heaven. What Jesus has been doing, especially in this 20th century, has had a profound effect on all humans. Moreover, Jesus’ effect on our lives is not limited to what he has done in the past. It reaches out to include what he is doing at present and, happily, what he will do in the future.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Returning to our theme: Jesus Christ​—God, man, or myth? What do you think? A mythical Jesus Christ would mean that he was neither God nor man, making further consideration pointless. On the other hand, we should be eager to learn about a Jesus who is alive and who is empowered by God to bring lasting benefits to mankind.</p>

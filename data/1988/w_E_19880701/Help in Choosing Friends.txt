Help in Choosing Friends
Could you use some? Youths face many weighty decisions while growing up in these troubled times. A young girl from Britain writes regarding the help provided by Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It:
“I am sure that it is the best book ever written for children. I am 13 years old, and it has helped me with many things, such as ‘Why Study in School?,’ ‘Do You Finish What You Start?,’ and ‘What Kind of Friends Do You Want?’ I have had some problems choosing friends, and this chapter has really helped me. Thank you for this truly wonderful book.”

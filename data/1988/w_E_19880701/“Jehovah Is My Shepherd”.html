<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 1, 2. What were some of David’s accomplishments, and how many psalms did he compose?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">IMAGINE this scene: Philistine troops face the army of Israel. Goliath, a Philistine giant, is defiant. A young man, armed only with sling and stones, runs to meet him. A well-aimed stone pierces the giant’s skull and kills him. Who was the young man? David, a shepherd who won this stunning victory with the aid of Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:1-9:17:58" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel, chapter 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In time, this young man became Israel’s king, ruling for 40 years. He was an expert harpist and composed much poetry under divine inspiration. David also wrote over 70 beautiful psalms that are a source of much encouragement and guidance for Jehovah’s people today. The best known of these is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:0-19:23:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a>. Why not open your Bible and follow along as we undertake a verse-by-verse study of this psalm?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah, a Loving Shepherd</strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 3. (a) On what occasions did David risk his life to protect his sheep? (b) In what sense is Jehovah our Shepherd?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><em>“Jehovah is my Shepherd.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:1-19:23:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1</a>) As an experienced shepherd, David knew how to lead, feed, and protect the sheep. For instance, he courageously protected his sheep from a lion on one occasion and a bear on another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:34-9:17:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:34-36</a>) David’s sheep trusted their shepherd implicitly. But in relation to Jehovah, he himself was a sheep. Since David felt secure in God’s loving care, he could say: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.” Do you enjoy this feeling of security under the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God? He surely leads, feeds, and protects his sheeplike worshipers today. Moreover, as appointed elders in the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, faithful, loving undershepherds zealously care for the sheep.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 4. How is our situation today similar to that of the Israelites in the wilderness?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><em>“I shall lack nothing.” </em>Think carefully about this statement. Because of Jehovah’s loving care, do you not have a soothing feeling of calmness and confidence? Do you remember what happened to the Israelites when they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years? Why, God provided for all their basic needs! <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>It is the same today. Jehovah’s faithful servants lack nothing. Many can echo these inspired words of David: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:25-19:37:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25</a>) Today, an abundance of spiritual food is being provided through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 24:45-47</a>) In addition to several meetings a week, we have the Bible, the magazines <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>and many other publications. Even in countries where the preaching work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is banned, supplies of spiritual food are received regularly. Jehovah’s sheep lack nothing!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5. Why are Jehovah’s sheep today peaceful and relaxed, and with what result?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><em>“In grassy pastures he makes me lie down.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:2-19:23:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2</a>) There were large grassy pastures around many cities in ancient Israel. As a loving shepherd then led his sheep to fine, safe pasture grounds, so Jehovah cares for his sheep today. Says the psalmist: “We are the people of his pasturage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:13-19:79:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 79:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:7-19:95:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 95:7</a>) Literal sheep do well when they are contented and are able to rest in the heat of the day. Jehovah’s sheep today are peaceful and relaxed because they have confidence in mature shepherds​—trained overseers in congregations and circuits. As a result, the spiritual flocks are increasing. Many people previously treated badly by the false shepherds of Babylon the Great are now very happy and contented as Jehovah’s sheep.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. How does Jehovah ‘conduct us by well-watered resting-places’?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><em>“By well-watered resting-places he conducts me.” </em>In Israel a shepherd had to guide his flock to a pool or a stream for water. But water was often hard to find in the dry season. Today, Jehovah ‘conducts us by well-watered resting-places’ by providing the waters of truth in great abundance. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:13-26:34:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:13, 14</a>.) And the prophet Isaiah gives this rousing invitation: “Hey there, all you thirsty ones! Come to the water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:1-23:55:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:1</a>) By taking in these spiritual waters, the sheep gain protection from the fiery judgments to come upon those “who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:8-53:1:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:16-66:7:17" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7. When is spiritual refreshment from Jehovah especially helpful, and under what circumstances can memorized Bible texts prove to be highly beneficial?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><em>“My soul he refreshes.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:3-19:23:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 23:3</a>) When we are weary, in trouble, discouraged, or facing serious opposition, Jehovah refreshes us by means of his Word. Hence, it is good for Christians to make it a practice to read a portion of the Bible every day. Do you do this? Some find it helpful to memorize certain texts, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a> or <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>. Why is this beneficial? Well, if a crisis should occur and you do not have a Bible handy, comforting Scriptural thoughts can immediately strengthen you. Many brothers condemned to jails or prison camps because of standing firm for righteous principles have been greatly refreshed and strengthened by recalling memorized scriptures. Yes, God’s Word can cause “the heart to rejoice” and make “the eyes shine”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><em>“For his name’s sake.” </em>Jehovah’s Witnesses have the heavy responsibility of glorifying God’s name and bringing no reproach upon it.

If this is done because of our stand for such Bible principles as neutrality or the sacredness of blood, our conscience is clear. But if this was to happen because of our wrongdoing, we would be dishonoring Jehovah.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11. What is meant by “the valley of deep shadow,” and of what may this remind us concerning Jesus?</p>

A valley, or ravine, where beasts of prey lurk in the shadows is a dangerous place for sheep. David passed through many perilous valleys in his life, with death staring him in the face. But since God was leading him, he was confident and did not give way to unrestrained fear. We should have similar confidence in Jehovah. This reference to “deep shadow” may also remind us of Isaiah’s prophecy: “Those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.” Matthew referred to this prophecy and applied it to Jesus Christ, saying: “The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.” How? By the great preaching campaign that Jesus conducted.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:2-23:9:2" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:13-40:4:16" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Matthew 4:13-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>David ‘feared nothing bad.’ The same thing is true of Jehovah’s servants today, even though they are not popular in this evil world ruled by Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Many people actually hate them, and they are severely persecuted in some countries.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><em>“For you are with me.” </em>Please note a very interesting factor in this phrase. The inspired psalmist has changed from the <em>third person to the second. </em>Instead of speaking of Jehovah as “he,” David now uses the pronoun “you.” Why? Because it is more intimate. Danger brings us closer to our loving Father, Jehovah. We then enjoy a more intimate relationship with him. By means of prayer and supplication, we can call upon him for protection, and thus overcome our fears.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:12-36:3:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:12</a>.</p>

Both the rod and the staff can be used for defense and to represent or indicate authority. Certainly, these implements would be very useful in beating off such predators as wolves and snakes. A shepherd’s crook could also be used to nudge sheep in the right direction or even to draw back a sheep straying too close to a spot where it might fall and get hurt. Today, Jehovah provides faithful shepherds, elders in congregations, who defend the flock from such spiritual predators as apostates. Or the elders may have to counsel those who become lax in meeting attendance or deviate from Christian conduct.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>The 23rd <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:0-19:23:6" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> is like a gem with many facets that sparkle with light. It exalts the glorious name of our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah, and reveals how he guides, protects, and provides for his sheep. As a result, his people are happy, well fed spiritually, and rapidly increasing in number, even in countries where there is bitter opposition. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:0-19:23:6" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> also helps us to cultivate a warm, intimate bond with our Creator. And when we look at the starry heavens, as David often did while watching his flock, we are grateful that the Creator of this awesome universe cares for us as a loving Shepherd. Lovingly, he also offers us eternal life in the new world if we maintain our integrity to him. How grand it will then be to meet such faithful resurrected servants of God as David! And what a privilege to serve Jehovah, the Great Shepherd, to all eternity!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● <em>Time </em>magazine, May 26, 1952, considered these the “Words of the Week”:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“In nine cases out of ten what goes by the name of tolerance is really apathy. There are too many easy-going Americans who are up in arms against nothing because they have no fixed standards of right and wrong. They do not come out positively and wholeheartedly on the side of anything because, unlike their fathers, they have no robust convictions. Tolerance is a virtue, but it is not the supreme virtue.”—Robert J. McCracken, of Manhattan’s Riverside church.</p>

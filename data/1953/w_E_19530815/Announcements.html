<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>PRISONERS SECURE FREEDOM WITH HELP—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Rom. 8:21</strong></a><strong>, NW.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Efforts of men to secure real freedom for themselves have met with limited success. However, Jehovah God is now assembling the nucleus of an incoming new world society of freemen in the truest sense. He uses his witnesses to preach a message of liberation to all men of good will, calling this old world’s prisoners to ‘come forth’. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:9-23:49:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 49:9</a>) During September Jehovah’s witnesses will offer to the public the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and a bound book, on a contribution of only $2. All persons are invited to participate in this work of helping prisoners secure freedom by spreading vital knowledge. Also, if you would like to have a small tract that will enable you to help honest persons break the shackles of false religion’s grip, send for a packet of tract No. 2, <em>“Hell Fire—Bible Truth or Pagan Scare?” </em>The cost of 200 is only 25c.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the city of Aleppo, Syria, a Bible study aid was placed in a certain home. Upon making a return visit the missionary found that the only one manifesting any interest was the twelve-year-old daughter. She had read most of the book and wanted to subscribe for <em>The Watchtower</em>. A Bible study was started with her, and, being very studious, she made rapid progress. When the priest noticed that she was not coming to church, he paid her a visit. He told her that she must come to church to pray. She opened her Bible to where Jesus said that one should go to his private room to pray. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:6-40:6:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 6:6</a>, NW) He had no answer. Then he told her that if she would give up studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and start coming to church again he would give her twenty-five livres. To this the girl replied: “Jesus said, ‘My sheep hear my voice and follow me,’ so if I am a sheep and you have the voice of the Lord, there would be no need for you to offer me money. But since you want to pay money, it shows that you do not have the voice of the Lord.” Upon hearing that reply the priest in rage stormed out of the house. This girl is now having a regular share in making the good news of the Kingdom known to others and expects to be baptized at the first opportunity</p>

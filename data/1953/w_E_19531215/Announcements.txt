INDIVIDUALLY CHOOSING LIFE EVERLASTING
Jehovah God is the Life-giver. “Choose life . . . by loving Jehovah your God, by listening to his voice and by sticking to him, for he is your life.” Jehovah’s witnesses now take the course that leads to life everlasting by listening to God as he reveals his purposes today through the Bible study aid The Watchtower. Jehovah’s witnesses during the month of January will present a year’s subscription for The Watchtower at the regular rate of $1, with three booklets given free to each new subscriber.
YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
The 1954 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses may now be obtained on a contribution of 50 cents. It contains reports from ministers proclaiming the Kingdom message in all parts of the earth. Also, you will benefit each day from considering a Scripture text and helpful comments presented in the Yearbook. The 1954 calendar is also available. It beautifully illustrates the earth-wide preaching of ‘this good news of the Kingdom’ and the assembling of God’s servants. A service theme and Scripture text for each month appear on the calendar pad. Calendars are 25 cents each. Five or more will be sent to one address at the rate of 20 cents each. Place your order now.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here is a Bible handbook of 416 pages that provides ready proof of what the Scriptures teach on seventy different major topics. “Ancestor Worship,” “Faith,” “Marriage,” “Races of Mankind,” “Return of Christ,” “Sign of Last Days,” and “Spiritism”—these are but a few of the many subjects considered. First, the subject is defined and its origin shown. Then, under subheadings dealing with various aspects of that subject, Scripture texts are quoted (without comment) that show what the Bible teaches regarding the subject. Eleven different versions of the Bible are quoted from. <em>“Make Sure of All Things” </em>also contains an alphabetical listing of 287 “Subjects for Study” in addition to the seventy principal themes. This listing serves as a cross reference, directing the reader to pages throughout the book that also deal with these many additional subjects.

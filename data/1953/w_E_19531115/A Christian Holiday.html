<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Pope Backs May Day as Christian Holiday” was the title of an article in the New York <em>Times </em>of May 3, 1953. The article said: “In a May Day speech he delivered to 4,000 workers gathered in the Vatican from many parts of Italy, the Pope endorsed the celebration of the day as a Christian holiday for labor.” The <em>Times </em>then quotes the pope as asking concerning May Day: “Who better than the true Christian can give to it a profound significance?” Do true Christians celebrate May Day as a Christian holiday? You are invited to be the judge.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">May Day’s origin? <em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia </em>says on page 8294: “May Day festivals probably stem from the rites practiced in honor of a Roman goddess, Maia, who was worshiped as the source of human and natural fertility.” A conspicuous feature of this celebration has been (and still is, especially among school children) the dancing around the Maypole. The same encyclopedia states: “This Maypole is believed by most scholars to be a survival of a phallic symbol formerly used in the spring rites for the goddess Maia.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Did early Christians celebrate pagan festivals as Christian holidays? No! “To keep themselves free from idolatry they refused to associate with others in social and public festivities.” (<em>A History of Rome, </em>by George Willis Botsford, page 263) Another authority speaks of “the absolute refusal of the Christians to join in any religious festival.”—<em>Christianity and the Roman Government, </em>by E. G. Hardy, page 36.</p>

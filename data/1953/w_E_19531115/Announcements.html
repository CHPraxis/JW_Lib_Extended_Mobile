<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those who have now come to know the true God of the universe and his name Jehovah are delighted to honor his name. They want to express to others their knowledge of Jehovah. That is why you find Jehovah’s witnesses actively serving Jehovah in holy array. They say, “I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:33-19:104:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 104:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:29-13:16:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 16:29</a>, <em>AS</em>) A result of this holy worship is the gathering into association with Jehovah’s people a “great crowd” of persons out of all nations. They swell the ranks of those who regularly praise Jehovah by telling the good news about his incoming New World society to all who will hear. During the month of December Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions will offer to the people the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>or of the <em>Hebrew Scriptures, </em>and a bound book, on a contribution of $2. Where persons have the <em>Greek Scriptures, </em>Volume I of the <em>Hebrew Scriptures </em>will be presented. Let all worship Jehovah in holy array.</p>

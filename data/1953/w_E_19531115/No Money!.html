<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Gonzalez Valencia, archbishop of Durango, recently called on all Catholics in his Mexican diocese to defend “the holy church of God” against “Protestant propaganda” that “is becoming more and more active in our archdiocese.” However, he bemoans: “We do not have the inexhaustible funds that heresy has at its disposal.” Why not? Roman Catholicism claims to have far more than twice as many members as all “Protestantism,” claiming that four out of every seven so-called “Christians” in the world are Catholics. If the archbishop’s financial worries are right, then his people must have little interest in supporting their religion.</p>

Misrepresentation Misfires
● During a period of agitation on the proposed federation of the Central African territories of Nyasaland and Northern and Southern Rhodesia a two-day work stoppage was called by certain African political leaders. On a large farm where Jehovah’s witnesses have been holding meetings for many years, they were misrepresented to the new farm manager as being responsible for the work stoppage. In anger the farm manager ordered the witnesses to quit holding meetings on the farm because “you Watch Tower people are Communists and engage in politics”. The overseer of the local congregation called on the manager and with the help of the Watchtower publications was able to prove that Jehovah’s witnesses kept separate from all politics. As a result the farm manager placed a large building at their disposal for the holding of their meetings (they having previously met in the open) and said, “This is your church. I want you to come and teach the other people on the farm how to read and write as well as the truth from the Bible.”

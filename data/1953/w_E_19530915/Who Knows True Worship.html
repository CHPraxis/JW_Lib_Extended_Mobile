<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In 1951 an Iowa court threw out a bequest to promote the dissemination of the Christian religion when it found that so many conflicting views made it impossible to define Christianity. More recently a British lawyer’s will that specified that the recipient of his goods be “a member of the Church of England and an adherent of the doctrine of that church,” was thrown out of a British court which held that there are too many possible interpretations of what it means to be a member of the Church of England for that requirement to have any meaning at all. It ruled that it was impossible to define what the doctrine of the Anglican church is, and hence the degree to which one is “an adherent” of that doctrine. Of course, the apostles and early Christians had no such problem. They knew what true worship was, and narrowly defined it. It was only with the additions, divisions and confusions of false teachers who peddled their own ideas instead of God’s that such a condition developed. Even those claiming to follow Christ no longer know for sure which way he went! They could determine it by casting off these human ideas and returning to the One Book that reliably reports what he preached and did, but too many are too busy with trivial matters to take time to do this, so they continue to use the name “Christian” while going in all sorts of opposite ways.</p>

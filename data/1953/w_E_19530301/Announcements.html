<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Cleanse yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah,” says His Word to those who are his dedicated servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11</a>, <em>AS</em>) The ways of Satan’s world are unclean, morally and spiritually, and every effort must be made to keep apart from such uncleanness if the salvation of God is to be realized. The <em>Watchtower </em>magazine provides strong spiritual food for persons who wish to conform to God’s righteous requirements and who are distressed by the present unhappy state of earth’s affairs. March will be a month to work with the <em>Watchtower </em>subscription for $1. Join in this good work, and let everyone be a subscriber. Three booklets are given free with each year’s subscription.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One of the most important days in 1953 is March 30. On that day, after 6 p.m., Standard Time, Jehovah’s devoted people throughout the earth will assemble to observe the Lord’s evening meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:20-46:11:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:20-26</a>, <em>NW</em>) Countless persons of good will, by their attendance in company with Jehovah’s anointed, will give evidence of their recognition of the importance of this occasion too. With gratitude and thankfulness the meeting will be opened with song and prayer. Then a capable dedicated and baptized brother, preferably of the anointed, will give a talk on the meaning and importance of the Memorial. The emblems, unleavened bread and red wine, will be served at an appropriate time in the course of the meeting, and the anointed brothers will partake of them.</p>

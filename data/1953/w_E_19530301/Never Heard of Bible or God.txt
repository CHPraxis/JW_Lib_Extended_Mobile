Never Heard of Bible or God
● Ten-year-old John Lennon was called to the witness stand [in Middlesbrough, England] to give evidence in an auto case. When the boy placed his hand on the Bible to take an oath that he would testify only the truth, the judge asked him if he knew what book he was swearing on. “No,” John answered. “Have you ever heard of the Bible?” “No.” “Have you ever heard of God?” “No.” The judge heard the evidence without the oath.—U. P. report in Chicago Sun-Times, May 23.

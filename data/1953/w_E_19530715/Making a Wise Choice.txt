Making a Wise Choice
WHERE will you be staying when you come to New York city to attend the 1953 international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses? At a hotel? Or in a room in a private home?
A hotel, no doubt, offers greater privacy, but fewer opportunities for witnessing. The friendly personal touch experienced in private homes is not to be found in hotel rooms or lobbies. Hotel atmosphere is not as conducive to Kingdom-preaching. In private homes, on the other hand, it becomes increasingly difficult not to witness. The publisher meets the landlady face to face, and New Yorkers are not only hospitable but an extremely inquisitive people. They will want to know something about your home state, what you do for a living, how you became one of Jehovah’s witnesses, what Jehovah’s witnesses believe, etc. One cannot help but witness.
Many of these persons are of good will, already progressing in the truth; while others are rendering their first Christian gesture toward getting acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses. Some were landladies during the 1950 assembly at Yankee Stadium, and today they are Kingdom publishers.
Let us bear in mind the good name we bear as one of Jehovah’s witnesses by always showing Christian consideration to others, by expressing appreciation for kindnesses and hospitality, by notifying them about the day and hour of our arrival, and change of plans, if any. Many times landladies go to considerable expense and inconvenience to prepare accommodations for us. Some get new wallpaper and even new bedding. It would be wrong not to accept such kindnesses because of some personal, petty reason. It would be doing wrong to householders who have done good to you. At the same time it would be doing injury to the good name of Jehovah and his witnesses, and to the rooming committee and workers who spent many hours locating rooms and processing request forms. Be wise in choice, in conduct, and in consideration.

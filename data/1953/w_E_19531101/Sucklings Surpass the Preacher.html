<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● From “Strength for the Day,” a column in the Dallas (Texas) <em>Times Herald, </em>March 21, 1953, comes this statement: “On a pleasant Sunday morning this past summer I attended a church service at a famous camp-meeting ground. This spot had been the scene of many inspiring religious convocations. On the morning I attended, there were about 200 people seated in an auditorium which could comfortably accommodate 1,500. Only two persons in the congregation appeared to be between the ages of 15 and 30. The minister preached a sermon on an academic theme and never came within a mile of the problems of all of us sinners who were seated in the pews. . . . Twelve children on the platform sang an anthem and did it so well that the heart of everyone was raised to heavenly heights. ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings’—but not out of the mouth of the preacher.”</p>

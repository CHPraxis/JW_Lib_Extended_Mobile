<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>LOYALTY TO THEOCRATIC ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah, the Almighty Sovereign, does not tolerate disloyalty in his great organization. He requires full allegiance to the righteous principles his organization represents at all times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:8-6:23:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 23:8</a>, Mo) Love for God impels his faithful servants to intense loyalty. This they demonstrate not by words only, but also by consistent and continuous activity in behalf of what is just, true and righteous. Their loyalty moves them to clean and right living, and to widespread preaching of the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom, so that all persons may see the benefits that come from loyalty to God’s organization. That is why, during the month of November, Jehovah’s witnesses will go forth from house to house and offer the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and a bound book, on a contribution of $2. (Or, the <em>Hebrew Scriptures, </em>Vol. I, if persons have the <em>Greek Scriptures</em>) These will help persons of good will to appreciate the need for their loyalty to God.</p>

Do you know that all evidence points to the early realization of a complete change in earth’s affairs—a change from corruption, distress and perplexity to a new system of things under the direct administration of Almighty God and his Son Jesus Christ? If your mind is open to consider the facts, the 64-page booklet <em>Basis for Belief in a New World </em>will provide absorbing reading for you.

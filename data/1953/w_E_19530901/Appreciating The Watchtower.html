<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How do you feel about <em>The Watchtower? </em>Like the reader who wrote as follows? <em>“The Watchtower </em>is the most delicious morsel we’ve ever tasted. Each one gets tastier (if possible). No humdrum about our menu! It’s so good we can hardly digest one until we look forward to another. Have you ever gone into an exclusive candy kitchen and wondered how to choose what you want when you saw so many, many lovely kinds? I feel that way spiritually about <em>The Watchtower</em>. There is so much to study that I hardly know where to begin. Then when I begin, I can’t quit until I have to go and tell someone else about it, or discuss it with them. And so it goes. Never a dull moment!”</p>

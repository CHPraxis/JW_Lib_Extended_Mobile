<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A full measure of freedom from sickness, sorrow, corruption, false religion, sin and death is unknown in human history since the rebellion in Eden. But Jehovah God has provided a great Liberator, Christ Jesus, who opens the way for men to gain true freedom in a new world, now close at hand. “The creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>, <em>NW</em>) Right now persons of good will everywhere are moving steadily toward that complete freedom. How? By acquainting themselves with the free Word of God, which is the truth that breaks the shackles of false ideas, superstitions and teachings binding them. During September Jehovah’s witnesses will help human prisoners move toward the glorious field of freedom by presenting at each home the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and a bound book, on a contribution of only $2.</p>

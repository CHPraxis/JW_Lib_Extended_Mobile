<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The most astounding insight into interfaith was given by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale of New York’s Marble Collegiate Church in the <em>American </em>magazine, June, 1948. He used this example: “A generation ago a number of different companies which made many different kinds of motorcars were combined into one great corporation This corporation did not scrap all the old models and produce only one kind of car. It has continued to turn out many different models, to meet the preferences of customers, but by merging companies it has vastly increased the efficiency of its operation and thus made more cars available to more people than was ever possible before.” That is his proposal in the way of interfaith; keep all sorts of ideas to satisfy the customers. Pure worship and right doctrine are relegated to a secondary position. Such interfaithers want to satisfy the people, not God; to please their salary-payers, to let the customers say what they expect of their religion, rather than letting it tell what God expects of them. They are more concerned about interfaith than true faith, and anyone who does not approve of their broad religious course they consider “narrow”. They would not have liked Christ’s separateness at all. In contradiction of their theory, he said: “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” The wise will follow his warning, investigate, study, know the reason for their faith, accept only what can be absolutely proved, and will hold narrowly to pure doctrine—the only course that really leads to life!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 7:13, 14</a>, <em>NW; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:21-52:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:21</a>.</p>

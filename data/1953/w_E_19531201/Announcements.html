<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WORSHIPING JEHOVAH IN HOLINESS</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The time is here for preaching to and comforting the peoples with information concerning the God of the new world, Jehovah. In every nation members of the New World society are diligent to “ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name.” They “worship Jehovah in holy array” by adhering to his written Word, and by unitedly using their lips to sing his praises among all peoples. Everyone has his position in God’s organization and all work together in joy and gladness. A clean, pure worship, that is what pleases Jehovah. In pursuit of this kind of worship Jehovah’s witnesses will go forth during the month of December and visit people from house to house with the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and a bound book, on the small contribution of only $2.</p>

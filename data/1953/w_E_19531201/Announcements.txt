WORSHIPING JEHOVAH IN HOLINESS
The time is here for preaching to and comforting the peoples with information concerning the God of the new world, Jehovah. In every nation members of the New World society are diligent to “ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name.” They “worship Jehovah in holy array” by adhering to his written Word, and by unitedly using their lips to sing his praises among all peoples. Everyone has his position in God’s organization and all work together in joy and gladness. A clean, pure worship, that is what pleases Jehovah. In pursuit of this kind of worship Jehovah’s witnesses will go forth during the month of December and visit people from house to house with the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures and a bound book, on the small contribution of only $2.

Not only will you find in the Yearbook a factual report on the preaching work done by Jehovah’s witnesses in your country last year, but, additionally, reports from more than 100 different lands. Read about actual experiences in preaching God’s kingdom to “all kinds of men” as the only hope of the world. Jehovah blessed the faithful ministry of his witnesses and added to their number. New lands in which to preach were opened up during the last year. On reading the 1954 Yearbook your heart will be made glad to see how Jehovah is gathering his other sheep before the approaching storm of Armageddon. The Yearbook is only 50 cents a copy.

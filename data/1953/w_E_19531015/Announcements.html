<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>LOYALTY TO THE ORGANIZATION OF GOD—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:8-6:23:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Josh. 23:8</strong></a><strong>, Mo.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah is the Great Sovereign of the universe and, more strictly than any human government, requires loyalty to his organization on the part of his servants. This means loyalty to God’s Word as his statement of operating principles. Those to whom Jehovah entrusts his kingdom interests today are servants who have demonstrated their loyalty to him under test, having the same strict conformity to his law as was demonstrated by Christ. Loyalty to God is a continuing, steady course—past, present and future. Said Joshua, “Be loyal to the Eternal your God as you have been up till now.” This means working in harmony with the organization of God, serving at unity under it, recognizing that Jehovah’s blessing is realized with the organization. During the month of November Jehovah’s loyal servants will present to the public the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and a bound book, on a contribution of $2. (Or, the <em>Hebrew Scriptures, </em>Vol. I, if persons have the <em>Greek Scriptures</em>)</p>

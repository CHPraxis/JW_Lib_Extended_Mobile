<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S WAY IS LOVE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Everything Jehovah God does is prompted by love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 4:16</a>, <em>Knox</em>) Our very existence is an expression of his love. Everything in nature, being made for man’s pleasure, reflects God’s love. In these critical times God is displaying his love toward humankind by giving warning of his coming wrath against wickedness in the earth, so that men who love him may escape. The preaching of the good news concerning God’s provision for salvation increases daily; and those who love God show appreciation for this manifestation of his great love by taking part in preaching the good news to others. To this end, May will be a month for the distribution of booklets: 10 booklets for 15c; 5 booklets for 10c; or 2 booklets for 5c, depending on available supply. A booklet ought to be left in every home where possible. All persons of good will are invited to participate in this booklet distribution. Additionally, if you would like a small tract to prove to others that God’s way is love,’ send for 200 of the tract <em>Hope for the Dead</em>. The cost is only 25c for 200.</p>

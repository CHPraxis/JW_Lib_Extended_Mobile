<p><span class="font1">1953 YEARBOOK of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">APPINESS comes in greater measure through giving. Have you ever had that pleasure? Yes, you say, I have given many things to people I love, which made me very happy. But has not such happiness been only momentary and without permanence? Or, have you ever felt that you must give a gift to someone because he gave you a gift which more or less obligated you to do something in return? There was no happiness in that giving, was there? You were giving under compulsion, because you felt you must reciprocate. That is often the case in this system of things; this old world operates on that basis: You give a gift to me, and then I will give you a gift. In that way individuals obligate themselves to others. It occurs all the time in the political, religious and commercial world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of this world do not follow the excellent advice of Jesus, as it is related in Luke 14:12-15 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW):</span><span class="font6"> “When you spread a dinner or evening meal, do not call your friends, or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors. Perhaps some time they might also invite you in return and it would become a repayment to you. But when you spread a feast, invite poor people, crippled, lame, blind; and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.” “On hearing these things a certain one of the fellow guests said to him: ‘Happy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is he who is at the feast in the kingdom of God.’ ” Would you like to sit at the feast in the kingdom of God? You can, if you follow the Master’s advice and do not follow the practices of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us look back to a time long before ever we appeared on earth. It was Jehovah God who was doing the giving, and even then it was for our benefit. He gave of his great power, his wisdom, knowledge and love. He gave constantly in a way that affects our lives now. He is still giving. Blessings continually flow from him to his creation, and we are the recipients of these gifts from “the happy God”. (1 Tim. 1:11, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Out of his abundance Jehovah God gives to us. He asks for no return, but we can show our gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will you show your appreciation for the many blessings that Jehovah has bestowed upon you? He has been happy in giving to us. Is not there something that we can give to Jehovah? Everything we have we received from him in the first place; so if we are going to give him anything at all, what will it be? Really, all that the Father, the Creator of man, wants from his human creatures on earth or that such creatures could give him is the right kind of worship, true worship. This means worshiping Jehovah in holy array. It is something that comes out of the heart, out of a pure mind. If we worship the true God in the way he directs in his Word, he will be pleased. Our worship is our service to him. It should be performed in a spotless manner, and this we can do by observing his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A wise man of centuries ago wrote: “Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6, AS) Think of the vast amount of information known to the Creator. Think of his unfathomable knowledge and his wisdom. All this is his possession, but he does not just hold it to himself. Rather he reveals much of his wisdom to his intelligent creatures. He sends it forth through his Word and gives it to us for our blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every one of his creatures, whether we be young or old, whether we have gone through school or not, can obtain a portion of this wisdom and knowledge. It makes no difference whether you are a new Kingdom publisher in a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, or are a pioneer, a missionary, a member of a Bethel home or in a branch office of the Watch Tower Society—you may receive of these wonderful things from God. You must apply yourself, though, and put forth the effort to obtain this knowledge and then show wisdom in dispersing it. We do not want to be like a sponge, just absorbing water, and then needing to have someone squeeze it out of us once in a while so that the good things we have learned will benefit others. It should not be necessary for other people to squeeze us and force the truth out of us. We should be so filled with the truth and with the understanding of God’s Word that it runs out of us constantly. It would be better to be like a bubbling spring, always giving forth fresh life-giving water freely, not making it necessary for someone to dig for the waters of truth. Do not forget, “There is more happiness in giving.” So why not bubble like a spring, “and let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free”?—Rev. 22:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To give means to bestow without a return. When God gave us the gift of his only-begotten Son, he did not give expecting that we would be able to repay him in like manner. No, his gift of life to us was full and generous. It is ours to keep if we continue faithfully obedient to his will. Likewise when we give this good message of life to others, we do not expect to be paid back with money, in time spent, or in possessions by those who receive it from us. We have received the message of life from our Father as a gift, and we want to freely give to others the knowledge we enjoy, that they also may gain the hope of eternal life. So if we are going to have real happiness in giving in the way Jehovah does, we must do something for other people without expecting a return from them. Man cannot add anything to God; but in view of the many gifts he has received from the hands of his Creator he certainly should show gratitude and follow the course of true worship and service to Jehovah. This service brings happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Happiness is a state of well-being and pleasurable satisfaction. One who is happy is in a peaceful state of mind and has comfort. But we do not always find our brothers and sisters in Jehovah’s organization in a pleasurable state of mind and at peace, comforting one another. Sometimes they are disturbed; something is irritating or bothering them. When peace is not present in a congregation, it is easy to see that something is lacking. Someone is not giving, and as a result others are not receiving the gifts they would if happiness existed in the congregation. Love is missing. Someone has forgotten that Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength,” and, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Mark 12:30, 31, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> So that is it: someone was not giving love to his neighbor, as Jesus said we should.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font6">There certainly is no pleasure in living without happiness. By turning to Jehovah’s Word we can find the secret to happiness; and we can have that happiness day in and day out throughout the years, even throughout eternity, if we strive for it. Surely if we find this secret to happiness, we ought to be eager to reveal it to others. The secret to happiness is, not merely in receiving, but more so in giving. If that is so, then let us give of what we have received to others. And what we have to give as Christian worshipers of the sovereign Ruler of the universe is the truth, the greatest gift, the knowledge of Jehovah God. We know Jehovah’s requirements for true worship, and we should give this knowledge to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah must have great pleasure and happiness in giving to his creatures. He gave us so much in his original creation; and he shows his love continuously by giving the sun, the rains, the fruits and vegetables, wool and cloth, trees and shelter, but, most of all, his words of life. Jehovah directed Paul the apostle to write for us: “Love . . . does not look for its own interests.” (1 Cor. 13:4,5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah was certainly not looking out for his own interests when he gave the warm spring rains to bring blossoms to fruitage, or the sun to ripen the wheat, or sheep to grow the wool, or trees to provide timber. All these things were gifts and blessings for mankind. They were an expression of God’s love. God was giving and is still giving all these things and many others to mankind, and he is a “happy God” in his giving. If we follow this same principle of love, then when we give we should not be looking after our own interests. Love does not work that way. Furthermore, there is more happiness in giving to others when they cannot repay. Jehovah allows the rain to drop upon the just and the unjust; his sun shines on the good and the evil. We should not be selective in giving the good news to others. Jesus said to preach the word to all nations, and it is by doing this that we shall receive happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If happiness is what brings us real satisfaction in living and makes our living worth while, then happiness is certainly to be sought after. Living at this time would not be enjoyable without happiness; so how can we increase our happiness? We live for only a short period of time now, but we should like to live indefinitely, for ages. Peter knew that understanding the words of the Most High brings life. He said to Jesus: “You have sayings of everlasting life.” (John 6:68, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> If we follow Jehovah’s Word and Jesus’ sayings, we shall have not only life, but life with happiness. That is why Paul said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (Acts 20:35, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Living in happiness certainly would be a delight for any person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After writing much information and instruction for our help in this day, Paul reminded us that real, full happiness came in giving. Starting with Acts 20:27 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW),</span><span class="font6"> let us observe now what he brought to our attention. He said: “I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.” He certainly was giving of what knowledge he had. How? In the twentieth verse of this same chapter he showed that he was teaching “publicly and from house to house”. So he did not hold back from any kind of activity. Now the example that Paul set is profitable for all God’s servants to follow. Are you also a house-to-house preacher? It was this course of action that Paul took as a preacher that made him so happy. He went on to say: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock.” (Vs. 28) So are you doing yourself the most good and God’s flock too? Paul’s interest was in his brothers, all of them. He knew the flock of God needed attention. He did not want to see the sheep of God scattered, and so he urged proper leadership. Paul knew what would happen after he left the disciples he had made and he repeated Jesus’ warning against wolves: “After my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness.” —Vs. 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul not only gave good news of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus and of the promised heavenly kingdom, but also gave the necessary warning to those who were striving for a place in God’s organization. He spoke plainly and yet with compassion, for he loved Jehovah’s congregation and the new systems of things Jesus introduced. Paul knew what Jesus had said about oppressive wolves’ getting into the congregation and causing a great disturbance. (See what John 10:7-16 says.) Paul’s interest in his brothers was keen and he wanted to give all he could in the way of admonition and example. Paul knew of the impending perils which might befall the Ephesian Christians and that to be forewarned meant to be forearmed. That is why he said: “Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that ... I did not quit admonishing each one with tears.” (Acts 20:31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Are all God’s people today taking such counsel? Do they heed God’s word through the apostle? Are they reading the Bible? Are they studying it? Are they building themselves up? Remember: “Pay attention to yourselves.” So ask yourselves: What am I doing in the way of providing an example for the flock? What is my service record?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul was not a burden to anyone in the congregation. He said: “These hands have attended to the needs of me and of those with me.” (Vs. 34) He did not ask someone else to take care of him or to arrange for his travel from place to place. It would have been a wonderful privilege to help him in any way possible, but Paul was there to give to his brothers, and it was by so doing that he received happiness. He was not asking them to give to him, nor was he giving expecting a return. Paul devoted his life to his brothers just as Jesus had set the pattern when he was upon the earth by devoting his time and energy to his apostles and to the people of good will who listened to him. Christ Jesus gave everything he had, even his life, for his brothers. He said: “No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends. You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you.” (John 15:13,14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Paul followed this wise counsel of Jesus and kept his commandment by serving his friends. Are you doing as much? If you are, then from experience you can say as Paul did: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—Acts 20:17-35, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul did not say that in receiving there was no happiness; there is. He knew the joy and happiness that come with receiving and hearing the truth. So do we. Look how Paul showed his gratitude after he listened to Jesus’ voice in the brilliance of his appearance. (Acts 9:3-22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Today we delight to go to conventions and assemblies, to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies and book studies, and to receive the good news from the instructor. But once we have absorbed all these good things, there is more happiness in giving the truth to others, more happiness even than we enjoyed in receiving it. Was not that true in Paul’s case? Yes. So let all dedicate themselves to Jehovah God and share his Word with others that they too may live. “Preach the word.”—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we read the Christian Greek Scriptures, we can see how all the apostles gave to their brothers. Likewise, someone at some time gave to you. Do you remember when you first heard the truth? Was it from someone who called at your door and explained the Kingdom message? or did you hear it in some other way? When you came to an appreciation of what was being explained to you, you were glad, and in a short time you began to see God’s organization and to associate with his people. You were happy to become a part of that organization, because its system of doing things was just, righteous and lovable. The truth, learning to think as God thinks, began to change your entire course of life. Someone had given something to you without cost; it was free, and it was making a change in you for the better and you were grateful to the giver. Next you wanted to tell others about it. So you dedicated your life to Jehovah God, and now you find more happiness in taking the truth that you have received and giving it to others. Now you are bringing them comfort, joy, pleasure, new ideas and the spirit of the new world; you can give the people a hope for life. Is it not the giving of this good news to others that brings you real happiness? There is no satisfaction in just storing up knowledge and information in your own mind and heart without ever letting it out. To keep it to yourself makes a miser of you, and a miser is a wretched person. His life is a miserable one; he just thinks of increasing his own hoard. He never has happiness in giving. Do you want to be a miser with your knowledge? If that is the way you are, you will always be a miserable person, because the real secret to full happiness is in giving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Happiness cannot lie dormant; it must be expressed. Happiness must affect you or someone else. Have you kept your happiness inactive? Have you kept it asleep? Are you the miser type who prefers to be unhappy and miserable, never giving to anyone else of that which you have learned? Even if you were to gather all the knowledge of the world into your mind, it would be useless if you never gave it out. In time it would be forgotten, and your knowledge would die with you. Why get knowledge if you are not going to use it? Real Christians receive knowledge from Jehovah. They are taught of Jehovah through his Word, and their happiness comes by telling others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>HAPPINESS OF KINGDOM AMBASSADORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus sent out twelve apostles as ambassadors to preach. He “gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every kind of disease and every kind of ailment”. He told them to go to the lost sheep and to “preach, saying, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ ” Their message was to show the Israelites how necessary it was for them to draw near to God and to repent of their wrong ways, and to listen to the Messiah and to acknowledge the kingdom of the heavens which was at hand. The apostles were to give these life-sustaining truths to their hearers, teaching them of the superior government that would bring blessings and life. The things that would be accomplished by this new government were illustrated in a miniature way; for the apostles had power to cure the sick, to raise up the dead, to make lepers clean and to expel demons. All these blessings they gave freely to the people who would hear. (Matt. 10:1-15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The days of their ministry must have been happy ones for them. They gave so much.—See Luke 10:17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Jesus continued giving his instructions to his apostles, he stressed this important thought by saying: “You received free, give free.” The powers that God gave the apostles through Christ Jesus by the holy spirit were not to be used for their own benefit, but to increase the interest of the people in Jehovah’s kingdom. After Pentecost marvelous signs were performed by means of the wonderful gifts of the spirit which were granted to the apostles. But even then the gifts of the spirit were not used by the apostles on themselves or on the congregation of God. The holy spirit or active force was used to heal the sick, to open blind eyes, and to make the lame leap. It was by reason of such miracles performed by the apos-ties that large crowds were attracted to them and then the apostles talked to the people about the good news of the Kingdom. This was done without money and without price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Master pointed out that the workers deserved their food in return for such labors of love. If the people did not appreciate what was being given to them and would not listen to the word, then the apostles were instructed to move on to another city. If a minister of God was unwelcome in a house, he was to leave that house; or if he was unwelcome in a city, he was to shake the dust off his feet and to go on. Jesus did not instruct the apostles to force the good news of the Kingdom upon the people. The individuals hearing the message had to decide whether they wished to accept it or to rebel against it. Likewise today, if they rebel, why spoil your own happiness by staying? It is best to leave the unfriendly people. In this day and age even in democratic countries where there is freedom of speech and of worship we find individuals, sometimes groups of people, whole towns, who say, “We don’t want you here doing this preaching.” They get the mayor or the police officials after Jehovah’s witnesses, arouse the ire of the people, and have these ministers of God driven out of town. Do you agree that they should then leave? Is that all right? Sure, they will go; they will shake the dust off their feet, and they will remain happy because they have a good message to take to other people in the next town.—Matt. 10:11-15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus warned that such conditions of opposition would exist, for he said: “Look! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.” (Matt. 10:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Do not try to force the truth on other people. Jehovah God is not trying to force his Son or the acceptance of his Son upon the world of mankind. He clearly states that whoever voluntarily believes on him shall have everlasting life, but those who do not believe will not be forced to live in the new world under Christ Jesus. Nor does he threaten them with theories of hell-fire and brimstone or purgatory to make them come to his Kingdom arrangement. He is not using inquisition methods as some religious organizations have done and are still doing to force people into his congregation. Jehovah God has something to give to the world of mankind. He is happy to give it to them, and they can accept it if they want to. It is a gift of life-giving truth which Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to all nations, peoples, kindreds and tongues. These words from the Bible are the words of life. Those who have ears to hear will gladly and gratefully accept the truth and thank Jehovah for bringing the knowledge to them. They will gain great happiness, for in a short time they also will share in the service of giving this word of truth to others. So despite all the hardships in the house-to-house work that a Christian may encounter in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom, there is still more happiness in giving than in being the householder standing on the other side of the door, just listening to what is said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the apostles and disciples of the early church had much to give to the people, and they gave it with gladness; they gave it freely. There is one thing we are sure of: No matter how much of the truth one might give, he would never run out of it. There is no limit to the speaking of the truth. It is like a stream that comes down out of the mountains, with a source far behind it in the towering, snow-capped peaks. That stream will always flow, and so will the truth of God’s Word always flow. It comes through his organization to all the nations of the earth. We shall never run out of truth or happiness as long as we keep on receiving and giving of what we receive. In fact, the more we give of the truth, the more happiness we shall possess. At the same time the truth will build us up and continue to make us stronger in carrying forth the good news from house to house. If our hearts and minds are filled with this good message from God’s abundance, we cannot refrain from telling it to others. All of God’s people, then, move forward, ‘worshiping Jehovah in holy array.’ —Ps. 29:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>CHEERFUL GIVER LOVED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Paul told the Corinthians: “But sis to this, he that sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:6,7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">If you know the truth, why should you begrudge it to others? Why should you thus short-change yourself in happiness? On the other hand, God will not compel you to preach it, because he does not love one who is a grudging giver; rather he loves one who is cheerful in his giving. Are you so full of the truth that it flows over, so full that you just cannot hold it in? If you are not that way, then you have not taken in enough truth for yourself. Why have you not been feeding and drinking with Jehovah’s people at their organizational study meetings? Remember, “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” (Matt. 12:34, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">Be a cheerful giver and abundantly reap happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes we find persons in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses who do not go out in the preaching service. How are we going to assist such individuals? Scolding will do no good. It would be much better to talk to such a person and show him the wonderful blessings that are in store for him, reminding him of the things he has received from God through his Word. Each one must resolve in his own heart what he is going to do, whether he will go out in the service of Jehovah and practice true worship, or not. No one should serve under compulsion. Forced praise is not acceptable to the Most High God; cheerful praise is. Just as your knowledge and understanding of his Word is determined by the time and effort you put into study, similarly your fruitage and harvest in the field service will be according to the effort you put forth. If you sow sparingly, if you do not want to plant the seed of truth by preaching the good news of the Kingdom in your territory, then you will not reap bountifully. If you sow plentifully by doing much preaching in your own home town or in an isolated territory that may be assigned to you, then you will reap plentifully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are a number of folks who go out in the field service and who wonder why they never have any good experiences. Usually you find that they are working only one or two hours in a month. They are not giving out enough to get happiness from the service. They hardly get started before they quit, and then they wonder why people never come into the truth because of their efforts. How about yourself? Are you paying attention to yourself and your life? You need to! Check yourself: Are you sowing sparingly, just a little bit now and then and never watering what you do sow, never looking after it? Are you afraid to go out and scatter seed abundantly in territory near your house or anywhere else? How do you feel about your service to God? Is it satisfactory? Do you do it grudgingly or under compulsion, or are you happy when others assist you? If you do your service, that is, enough of it, as to God, you will receive a great blessing. Give of your knowledge to others. Plant and reap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brothers want to assist you, just as Paul wanted to help the Ephesians and the Corinthians and all the other congregations that he had organized. So the company servants, the circuit servants and other servants appointed by the Watch Tower Society want to help you, the Kingdom publishers, become more efficient in the preaching of the good news. Accept their help in loving appreciation. And whatever you do in the field service, you should do because you love Jehovah. Do it because you know it is the right thing to do, because it is your worship of the Most High. Do it because you want the “joy of Jehovah”. Do it because you want the happiness in giving. If you do give the truth freely to others, you will find happiness. Jesus certainly was not unhappy in his service, and it was he who said: “Happy are those who are conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” (Matt. 5:3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> See how happy all those can be who are seeking Jehovah’s kingdom, as Jesus expressed in his lecture on the mount, recorded at Matthew 5:1-13.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Think of the responsibility that rests upon Christians today. Some prefer to think that the whole load of responsibility is upon Jesus Christ and that he did all the necessary preaching in addition to redeeming. Some today look upon Christ as the one who was supposed to do the preaching from house to house, and now all they need to do is to sit down and listen to his words as recorded in the Bible and watch what happens. Do you believe, as do many: “We’ll just wait now until God does something”? The early disciples did not look at it that way and neither do faithful followers of Christ Jesus now. They appreciate and apply what Paul said: “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us.” In other words, we are God’s ambassadors instead of Christ; or, we can be ambassadors in the name of Christ. But no matter how you construe what Paul said, we are the ones who are commanded to do the talking, representing God. That is why Paul pleaded with all those who would hear his words: “Become reconciled to God.” (2 Cor. 5:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> He felt his responsibility; he took hold of the task at hand as an ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If that is the case, then to be ambassadors we must do the same thing that Jesus did when he was upon the earth and “comfort all that mourn”. Certainly Jesus fulfilled Isaiah 61:1, 2, because he did preach good tidings; he did bind up the broken-hearted; he did proclaim liberty to the captives, and he did open the prison to those that were bound. He comforted all that mourned. While Jesus was sitting on the mountain, he said: “Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.” (Matt. 5:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> There is much comforting yet to be done, and this can be done only by ambassadors substituting for Christ. The comfort is furnished by their giving the good news they have to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One does not have to be hardhearted and domineering to get a place in Jehovah’s new world of righteousness. Just the opposite is essential; for Jesus said at the same time: “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.” (Matt. 5:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The study of Jehovah’s Word will make one mild-tempered. Those in the old world who are not of a gruff but of a peaceful disposition are the ones who seek after truth and righteousness. They are the kind of people who love living, and Jesus said they are going to inherit the earth. Anyone who is hungering and searching for righteousness is going to be filled, and such ones will also be made happy. Can you think of any greater joy to come to a person than for him to receive a knowledge of the truth and establish his faith to such firmness that he goes out and preaches the good news he has learned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Think of how filled with the truth such a person is, even to the point of overflowing! Yes, it makes those who have studied God’s Word and who rejoice in the wisdom and knowledge they have received from it merciful toward others in sharing the truth with them. The knowledge of the truth changes their lives, and they become mild-tempered and generous. So this quality is expressed in their giving, and they are happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people in the old world show mercy, and the truth will find such ones too. As Jehovah’s witnesses go about the world proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom and trying to feed the other sheep, the merciful ones will listen with appreciation. Certainly, “happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.” (Matt. 5:7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah God will show mercy to these merciful ones and will not let them go down into everlasting destruction at Armageddon, because they have the right heart condition. These Christ is gathering now as his other sheep and a great many will survive Armageddon. They are pure in heart, happy and peaceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was for all such ones that the Master “opened his mouth and began teaching” as he sat there upon the mountain. The things that he taught would bring happiness to any individual with a right heart who would listen and believe. For wise counsel concerning the right course to be taken as a Christian, much can be gained by reading Matthew, chapters five, six and seven, which contain the sermon on the mount. The great crowd who heard that discourse were amazed at the way Jesus taught. He spoke to the people so differently from the scribes and the Pharisees who were the religious leaders of that time. You will find, too, in reading this discourse of Jesus that he spoke altogether differently from the clergy of Christendom today. You, too, will be like the multitude; for “when Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching; for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes”. —Matt. 7:28, 29, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom’s clergy are not substituting for Christ as ambassadors. So the responsibility is now placed upon us as individuals to give others the knowledge we have; for thereby will come our happiness. Christ Jesus as the Son of God had the authority from his Father to preach this good news of the Kingdom. The command to preach this same message was passed on to the apostles and to the Christians who followed thereafter. Hence today we are ambassadors substituting for Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses have taken up that command to preach, and throughout the world they can be found ‘worshiping Jehovah in holy array’. Each one of them takes his position in Jehovah’s organization, doing with his might what his hands find to do, seeking for opportunities to help others do the same. They have the joy of their Lord Jesus Christ. It is their joy in giving that has made them such earnest ministers of Jehovah God. It is their happiness in giving and their knowing they are right and have the backing of Jehovah that has made it possible for them to preach this good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>MATURITY BRINGS HAPPINESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A baby enjoys getting older. New fields are invaded by the child’s mind. When a youngster is but a baby its field of exploration is the crib or its mother’s arms. It is not long though until a baby wants to do more exploring, and it starts to crawl. It gets into and takes hold of everything possible. The child wants to see; it wants to know, and it is reaching out for knowledge whether it knows it or not. Often when you explain things to a child it will say, “Why?” Sometimes the questions children ask us make us stop and think, and at times our reply is simply, “Just because.” But that is not satisfactory; there must be reason, there must be logic and purpose in our answers. The child is growing up, getting more mature, and it receives happiness from knowing the whys of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not long until the child is old enough to go to school. Then he really starts using his mind and taking in much information. The things a child learns in the first grade or the few years following he does not have to go back and study over again. These first things he learns are fundamental; they are basic. On these fundamental principles all the theories of grammar, arithmetic and pronunciation are based. He is ready to go to new ideas and greater things. So by the time he gets to high school he is working on algebra, geometry, perhaps studying chemistry, physics, languages—and those very early fundamental principles he learned are still with him and are always very helpful. They are basic things. Without that first fundamental information he could not gain maturity, and he would not be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When an individual takes up a subject for study he must get the elementary principles of the subject in mind and then build on them. As he builds on these true principles he gains greater knowledge and understanding. If he does not study and does not try to advance he will forget even the basic principles. Some people are like that. They become lazy in the use of their minds and they do not take the time to review the things they have learned or to use the knowledge they have to gain greater knowledge. Many people today get a knowledge of the truth and learn the fundamental doctrines, but because they do not use what they have learned by telling it to others, they find they must keep studying the same things over again and again. They are like the people Paul spoke about in Hebrews 5:12 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font6">: “For, indeed, although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God, and you have become such as need milk, not solid food.” It is absolutely necessary to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">use</span><span class="font6"> the Word of God in order to have it stick in our minds. If we do not use that Word as mature teachers, we shall continue as spiritual babes. But think of the happiness that comes with increased knowledge! Then why should we always be going back to the things we learned once before? Paul said: “For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Vss. 13, 14, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> There is no happiness in doing wrong. If you are mature you will know what is right and do it, and your knowledge and maturity will bring you happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Associating regularly with Jehovah’s witnesses for Bible study is the thing you need to build you up in the faith. Jehovah’s witnesses have Kingdom Halls scattered throughout the world. In fact, there are 13,942 companies or congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in the world with regular meeting places so those who want to learn can learn. By regular attendance and study you can gain maturity. Jehovah God has given humans the mind to use, and it is only through use that one’s perceptive powers will be trained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is natural for Jehovah’s witnesses as ministers and teachers to come to the conclusion that after a time the individuals with whom they are studying the Bible in their homes are ready to go out into the field service and do something with the knowledge they have gained. These ministers know that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving”. During the service year of 1952, there were 426,704 ministers of Jehovah God preaching the good news every month. That is the average for the service year. There are many more publishers of the Kingdom message than that throughout the world, but not all of them got out every month to preach the Word, due to interferences or duties in life. But if they would arrange their affairs (and they should), they could be regular publishers preaching the good news, which is the most important thing a creature can do today. They would have more happiness in life if they were doing this regularly, because they would be giving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mature ministers of Jehovah keep busy making back-calls by going to the homes of people who are interested in the truth. The reason for making these back-calls is to try to help the people of good will use their perceptive powers, training them to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong, and teaching them the fundamental doctrines set forth in God’s Word. To accomplish this Jehovah’s witnesses made 21,980,794 back-calls on interested persons world-wide last year. They have been conducting 279,622 regular Bible studies on the average every month in the homes of people who want to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After spending six months or maybe a year studying in these homes, they believe it is time for these persons to advance into service; and they feel as Paul did when he expressed himself at Hebrews 6:1-3 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW):</span><span class="font6"> “For this reason, now that we have left the elementary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works, and faith toward God, the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment. And this we will do, if God indeed permits.” If you will read the 6th chapter of Hebrews from verses 1 to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12,</span><span class="font6"> you will see that Paul is trying to get these early Christians to grow, to become mature and to be like himself in the service. He points out that “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering”.—Heb. 6:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font6"> to those who are kind to Jehovah’s witnesses, giving them a cup of cold water, the Lord Jesus says: ‘These will be blessed.’ They are as sheep being put on the right side of the Master. At least they do not show the goatlike spirit. But do not stop with just giving a cup of cold water. Grow up to maturity. Do not stop when you have learned the fundamental doctrines that lead to life. Go on and gain life. Seek it and you will find it. That is why Paul says, in the 11th and 12th verses: “But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, in order that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 1953 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font6">shows how industrious these ministers of God have been during the twelve months of their service year and how they have been striving for maturity and happiness in Jehovah’s service. Many of them are in the pioneer service. By that we mean they Eire spending at least 100 hours a month or more, some as high as 150 or 200 hours, in preaching this good news of the Kingdom that must be announced in all the world for a witness. There were 18,181 pioneers on the average every month throughout the year, devoting themselves to the ministerial activity. Of this number there are 1,421 who have gone through the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and who are serving in the capacity of pioneers, missionaries, circuit servants or branch servants. This great array of God’s ministers, 18,181 pioneers and 408,523 company publishers, has gone forth to the ends of the earth. In fact, their joy in wanting to give freely of the truth took them into 127 different lands, countries, territories and islands of the sea to preach the good news. They distributed literature to the amount of 14,662,122 Bibles, books and booklets so that the people might learn more of the wonderful promises Jehovah has set forth in his Word. In addition to that, they saw to it that many of the interested people would receive the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines regularly. During the year they obtained 704,063 new subscriptions for these two fine magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You probably have seen Jehovah’s witnesses on the street corners offering these two magazines, and you may have wondered, How many do they distribute? The report for the year shows that these diligent servants of God have placed 22,484,345 individual copies of these two magazines all over the world in 36 different languages and in 127 different countries. Many of the magazines were distributed in house-to-house work, where much time can be spent talking to the people. To supply all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines world-wide the Society printed 58,531,323 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses see that there are many things to be done in these days, but the greatest work is to promote the true worship of Jehovah God and to preach about his kingdom so that others may share in this wonderful hope. So interested are these ministers in their work that they spent 68,703,699 hours preaching. That is a great deal of talking. Have you shared in preaching the Kingdom message to others? Have you reported your work? Because of the preaching Jehovah’s witnesses have done they have interested many others in the work. In fact, before the year ended a new peak of publishers was reached, because many of those who had become interested in the great ministerial activity of Jehovah’s witnesses had gone out with them in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The peak in number of publishers reported for any one month throughout the whole year was 456,265. This is the highest number of persons who have engaged in field service to help others gain knowledge of Jehovah ever to report to the Society in one year. So that such ones will never go back to childlike living, the Watch Tower Society has regular Bible studies in Kingdom Halls and in the homes of the people. Attending these meetings helps one grow to maturity. Public lectures also are arranged at the Kingdom Halls, and these talks totaled 240,921 last year. What is the reason for all this effort? It is that those who are turning to the truth may grow in powers of understanding. Paul expressed it in this way: “Brothers, do not become young children in powers of understanding, but be babes as to evil; yet become full-grown in powers of understanding.” —1 Cor. 14:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time is here for those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God to forget the things that are behind, this old world and its immoral way of living, and to move forward. Look to the things ahead; consider the New World society and the blessings to come. This means activity. If every company of Jehovah’s witnesses increased its number of publishers by 10 per cent during the 1953 service year, we would average 468,374 publishers for 1953. Expansion comes by bringing to maturity those who are interested in Jehovah’s kingdom. We know they will gain happiness in their maturity because they will want to give freely of the water of life. So we must expect increases and help the new ones to see their responsibility to teach others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.” (John 15:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Are you going to bear fruit, or are you going to be a baby all your life? Why not be a teacher? You ought to be! Let your maturity bring you happiness. “Let us press on to maturity.” (Heb. 6:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> As those in Jehovah’s organization strive for maturity, they will increase in numbers. So let those who are mature ministers help others during 1953, and take those who are growing in the truth out in the witnessing work with you. If you do, we can expect a 20 per cent increase in the peak number of publishers in every company in the world and a corresponding 20 per cent increase in the year’s peak report for 1953. Why not strive to hit this new peak of 512,044 by the end of April 1953? It can be done by striving for maturity and happiness and by really helping the 54,707 individuals who symbolized their dedication to Jehovah’s service last year by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God will bring these mature, happy ministers into his kingdom of righteousness in not too long a time. Paul said: “Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the calling above and which God extends in Christ Jesus. Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” (Phil. 3:13-16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The anointed remnant must be of this mental attitude, and the other sheep too are urged to follow the same advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of us have experienced the sorrow and unhappiness of this old world. Now having turned to God’s Word we have learned what it means to be happy and joyful in his organization. So Peter said: “Accordingly, put away all moral badness and all deceitfulness and hypocrisy and envies and all kinds of backbiting, and, as newborn infants, form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word, that through it you may grow to salvation, provided you have tasted that the Lord is kind.” (1 Pet. 2:1-3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> So Jehovah’s servants everywhere are trying to help the “newborn infants” to grow up and gain salvation. There are many of these young ones who need help as babes in the truth. At the Memorial service of Jehovah’s witnesses last year there were 667,099 who associated themselves with God’s people on that one night. It is easy to see there is much interest, but over 200,000 of this number are spiritually babies. Most of them know the fundamental doctrines, and they are happy that they see the difference between the Devil’s organization and Jehovah’s organization. More truth though will bring happiness, satisfaction, contentment, and eventually everlasting life. Why not help all to be mature in the truth? Then they will know, just as you do, the Scriptural reason why this world is in this dilapidated condition and the reason why Jehovah God is going to destroy it. They will know what to say to people in order to comfort them. They will know, as you do, that happiness comes by gaining maturity and by tak-</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>A NEW SYSTEM OF THINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are known world-wide. They have become conspicuous. This is not because of their dress, their customs, any peculiarity in their make-up, nor particular identification marks; but still we will admit that Jehovah’s witnesses are different. Do you want to know why? Merely because they have “quit being fashioned after this system of things”. And what do we mean? Simply this: As far as this old world is concerned, its ways of life, its hopes and its morals, there is no attraction for Jehovah’s witnesses. In fact, they are thoroughly convinced and know from Jehovah’s Word, the Bible, that this world is of its god, Satan the Devil. The world is under the same influence that controlled the governments of earth back there in Paul’s day, and Paul wrote this at 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW: </span><span class="font6">“If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.” Here it is plainly said that the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers. The unbelievers are those who do not believe in Jehovah, the sovereign Ruler of the universe, nor in his kingdom which he will establish through his Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have quit being fashioned after this unbelieving world, and they are looking to a new system of things, a system of things that is under the direction of Christ Jesus, the King. Christ Jesus received his power and began to reign in 1914. We do not have space here to explain all of this, but the Watch Tower publications have gone into detail showing that Christ returned to receive his power and begin reigning at the end of the Gentile times. Matthew, in the twentyfourth chapter, clearly points out that the things that have occurred in the earth since 1914 have fulfilled Bible prophecy and show that Christ is now present. He has introduced a new system of things—no, not just in 1914. It was nineteen hundred years ago that God began taking out of the Gentile nations a people for his name. But in these last days, Christ Jesus declared, this good news of the Kingdom would be preached and the work would be carried on under his direction. No, he is not visible to human eyes. He is in heavenly glory with his Father. But from his heavenly position he directs the affairs of his faithful servants on the earth and commands them to go preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Transforming their minds, the making of their minds over, makes Jehovah’s witnesses different from other persons in the world. They think differently, and they act differently. They preach a message entirely different from that of anybody else, the message of God’s kingdom, which is the only hope of mankind. They believe and trust in this kingdom of Jehovah God with all of their heart, mind, soul and strength. The reason they have such faith in this kingdom and the blessings it will bring is that backing this kingdom is the sovereign Ruler of the universe, Jehovah God; and it is he that has set his King, Christ Jesus, the faithful and wise Servant, upon his throne in 1914. From there he rules and will continue to rule until he has put every enemy under his feet, and the last enemy to be destroyed will be death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is common knowledge that the nations of the earth cannot accept God’s kingdom nor do they want it. They advocate the United Nations. The nations of the earth think they can bring about peace and prosperity for the human family without God; but this is impossible. Jehovah’s witnesses do not believe peace will come in that way. They know for a certainty that the only hope for mankind is the kingdom that Christ Jesus talked and preached about for three and one-half years when he was upon the earth. The old system of things will not be able to shape itself into the new system of things. There is going to be a great war; and that will be in the great day of God the Almighty, the battle of Armageddon. Everyone on earth is fashioning himself according to this old system of things except Jehovah’s witnesses, who realize it will pass away. Then the new system of things which is in operation under Christ Jesus will take full control. This new system of things will bring peace, prosperity, joy, happiness and love of neighbor, and, above all, the love of every creature for Jehovah God. That is the system of things for which Jehovah’s witnesses are working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In their preaching of this message of salvation, Jehovah’s witnesses use the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, a New York corporation, and the International Bible Students Association, a Canadian and British corporation. There are other corporations, made up by small groups of people, that are used for convenience in different parts of the earth, and in all the principal countries of the world Jehovah’s witnesses have branch organizations established. But all these branches are governed from a central headquarters at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. The only reason for the existence of these corporations and the branch offices is to organize Jehovah’s witnesses so that a better and more efficient spreading of the good news of the Kingdom can be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In many parts of the world the Society owns and operates printing plants where the message of the Kingdom is published in 100 different languages. These publications are used by Jehovah’s witnesses in conducting home Bible studies, which they have found to be the greatest help and comfort to those who are seeking truth and righteousness. For one of Jehovah’s witnesses to go right into the homes of the people and sit down and answer their many questions about world problems and how this whole thing is going to be straightened out by Jehovah God takes time, and it takes individual study too. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses concentrate on home Bible studies. Of course, they also have their large congregational meetings where Jehovah’s witnesses come together to build up their own minds in Bible study and reflect on the wonderful truths that are set forth in the Bible, delving into the deep things of God so as to grow in the knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son. They fully appreciate the need of taking in knowledge all the time in order to be in the way of gaining eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are a society of ordained ministers. The question is often asked, “Well, how are they ordained?” They are ordained in the same manner that Christ Jesus was ordained, or set aside, for this very holy purpose of being one of God’s slaves in the earth. First of all, a person must have a good knowledge of God’s Word. An individual who is seeking truth and righteousness will be attracted to the Word of God and will study it. After the individual has studied God’s Word and knows its contents and what Jehovah God is teaching and wants us to do, then that one dedicates himself to God and his service. He then must go through a certain ceremony which Christ Jesus set down, and that is water immersion. The individual who has made a careful study of God’s purposes believes them and shows that he believes them by earnest work in preaching this good news from house to house and publicly. Before baptism, he is asked certain questions in regard to his belief. If he answers in the affirmative he is qualified as a candidate for water baptism. When Christ Jesus was upon the earth, he presented himself to John the Baptist and was immersed in water, his body being completely covered over by the waters of the Jordan river; and so it is with those who dedicate their lives to Jehovah God now. They are set apart for God’s holy service as was Christ Jesus. The immerser takes the individual and puts him down under the water, completely baptizing him in water, which symbolizes that the individual submits himself to the will of God, and God’s will alone. He has declared himself to be dedicated to the worship of Jehovah, the only true God. Such dedicated one God ordains as His minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a very serious step for any individual to take whether he be a man or a woman. He appreciates that henceforth he must be faithful to Jehovah, the God of the universe, he must maintain his integrity no matter what may occur, and he must remain faithful until death. His only interest henceforth is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and His word, the spreading of this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, and using every opportunity he has to talk about the good news he has learned through his studies of God’s Word. There is no turning back or compromising, for, having done this, he has quit being fashioned after this system of things; and he is now going to study forever the knowledge and wisdom that Jehovah has in store for him. He will continue his transformation work of making his mind over so that he may prove the complete and acceptable will of Jehovah God. —Rom. 12:1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has hundreds of thousands of ordained ministers associated with its work, and each one accepts the same responsibility that was placed upon Christ Jesus and prophesied by Isaiah in the 61st chapter, verses 1 and 2. They know that the spirit of Jehovah God is upon them, and therefore they go forth to preach to the meek, to comfort all that mourn, to bind up the brokenhearted, to declare liberty to the captives and to open the prison houses. Millions of persons are bound in this old world, but Jehovah God has declared that he will free them when the time comes for them to be free. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, have dedicated themselves to Jehovah’s cause of truth and righteousness and by his undeserved kindness will press on, preaching the good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find Jehovah’s witnesses scattered around in all the countries and the islands of the sea. Many of these are special representatives of the Society. Some are acting as branch servants and others work in the branch offices taking care of the correspondence, answering Bible questions, and other necessary details, looking after the congregations of the Society in the cities, towns and villages of the different territories. Still there are others who are preaching the good news fulltime, spending most of their hours going from door to door and house to house, publicly proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. Some have gone into foreign lands to open up new missionary fields. Others are appointed to circuit ministerial work and district organization. All of these come under direct supervision of the Society, and we list here those who are in special service. This does not mean that only these who are listed in the 1953 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font6"> are ordained ministers; for while the ordained ministers throughout the world run into the hundreds of thousands, reporting regularly to the Society, these particular persons whose names appear below have special service assigned to them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This Bible school was established February 1, 1943. The purpose of the school is to give further divine education to ordained ministers. The Society calls from its world-wide field specially selected men and women and gives them training at Gilead School for missionary work. In the past</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nine and one-half years we have entered 2,039 such students; and of that number, 1,953 have completed the course. The 19 classes were made up of 653 single brothers, 614 single sisters and 686 married persons. Ordained ministers were called from 46 different countries including the United States; so it is not a school just for Americans, but it is a school to train Jehovah’s witnesses no matter where they live in the world, and 784 of those who have finished the course have come from countries outside the United States. The only ones who are given this education are those selected by the president of the Society upon the recommendation of the branch servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The life at the School is a very busy one, because from eight o’clock in the morning until 12:15 the students are going to classes, and in the afternoon from 1:15 until 2:30 there is a lecture period by one of the instructors or a guest speaker. Suitable homework is given to all of those going through the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and a large amount of research must be done in the library. It can truthfully be said that very intensive study is carried on during their period of schooling. It is hoped that the training they receive there will be lasting and that they will always diligently study God’s Word and put forth an earnest effort to explain God’s truths simply and clearly to those who have an ear to hear. The registrar of the School reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The largest attendance at any winter graduation was at the closing of the term of the 18th class. The graduation was on Sunday morning, February 10, when 1,700 persons attended to see 99 students graduate from the School. Ninety-five of these received diplomas of merit. Due to wintertime the graduation was held indoors and the Gilead auditorium was packed to overflowing. The president of the Society delivered a heart-to-heart talk to the students and those in attendance, pointing out to them their responsibilities of the future as well as the responsibility that falls upon all of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">no matter where they are. It was pointed out that all of Jehovah’s witnesses are ordained ministers, but now a special responsibility falls upon these 95, because it will be their privilege in most instances to open up new fields, finding the other sheep and showing them the way to life. It will not be long until all of these students will be off to their foreign assignments which will take them to five continents of the globe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">having come from 13 different countries. This class proved to be a very diligent and hard-working class. In the course of the term, only two were dismissed because of health reasons, so the final number to graduate was 111. This group finished the school term in the summer, and the assembly of Jehovah’s people for this graduation broke all previous records. On Saturday evening there were 8,104 attending the program, and on Sunday morning the amazing number of 12,113 gathered to listen on the lawn in front of Shiloah, the library of Gilead School, where a platform had been built for the occasion on the north side of the campus. There was a lot of work in connection with this graduation because the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead is situated out in the country. It was necessary to find accommodations for 4,000 persons for rooming overnight; and, additionally, a very fine cafeteria was operated there on the Gilead premises to feed all of the guests for a day. Showing the immensity of the crowd, 2,963 motor cars were counted in the special parking lots that had been arranged on farm property. The organization worked very well in handling this great multitude, and everyone seemed to rejoice in the assembly. The press gave a good account of the event, reporting that 111 graduates finished school, with 101 receiving diplomas as their award for good work. The foreign assignments given this group spread them out to 30 different countries. The list of graduates follows.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>BRANCHES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">When an organization gets as large as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, it certainly is necessary to subdivide the work; and that is why the Society has 64 branches throughout the world. Certain countries, states, islands of the sea and other territories are assigned to a branch and it looks after the Kingdom interests in that assigned territory. The branches make monthly reports to the president’s office on all the countries under their jurisdiction, and at the close of the year a complete report of the work accomplished in all these lands is sent in to the president’s office and there compiled into the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font6"> It is the responsibility of the branch servants and all those associated with them to look after the interests of the Kingdom in their particular areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order for all the brothers to gain maturity, it is necessary to have good district servants and circuit servants. A proper example of field service must be set by these servants. For those who are Jehovah’s witnesses to advance to maturity, good company servants must be selected; and here again a proper example must be set for all of those associated with the company organization. If good, zealous, active servants are appointed by the branch, it can be expected that there will be an advancement of Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For our advancement, we need to gather together the other sheep in the territory, properly feeding them with the food that is convenient and helping them to grow up into zealous, very active Christian publishers. Anyone who dedicates his life to Jehovah must be brought to the point where he realizes that he is an ambassador for Christ and that he is responsible to do the same kind of work that Jesus did while he was upon the earth and to follow in the same path that the apostles walked, namely, going from house to house and preaching publicly the good news of the Kingdom. Everyone, regardless of the position he may hold in the organization, should look well to the responsibility placed upon his shoulders. He should accept this work as from Jehovah God, who places all members in the body as it pleases him. When an individual along the line slacks in his zeal or does not look well to the best interests of his brothers, it can be expected that there will be a slowing down in the preaching of the gospel. Then, too, when certain individuals do not cooperate and fall in line with the directions that come forth through the Society’s organization or become unclean in their worship and do not follow the way of preaching the message of the Kingdom or using the different facilities that are at hand, sometimes there is a slowing down in preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There must be unity of action in a great organization, and this certainly must be true in Jehovah’s organization. When you observe this report, you will see that the branches throughout the whole world follow the same campaign. Whenever possible, they always introduce to the people the same literature. The policy is very definite: going from door to door, preaching to the people wherever they have an opportunity and encouraging them to study their Bibles in their own homes. The servants see to it, too, that the organization is kept clean. So the great work that Jehovah’s witnesses are striving to do through their branch organizations is to help those who have an ear to hear to understand God’s Word and live properly now. This is best accomplished by home Bible study, that is, studying with people in their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, we are not interested in merely keeping the people in their homes and studying there, but we want them to come to our meetings. There they can study, too, the deeper things and become a part of the organization and eventually become publishers. If they want to serve God and gain life in the new world, they must be ministers of God. They must become his slaves. The more mature a person becomes in the truth, the better he will be as a servant of God and the greater will be his joy and happiness in living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Maturity is an essential thing, and what Jehovah’s witnesses have striven for during the past year is to help the many thousands who came into the truth during the previous year to become well grounded in the principles of truth and righteousness which are set forth in Jehovah’s Word, the Bible. We feel that great strides have been made during the past year toward accomplishing this, and now we look forward to a new year in which to continue the process of advance toward maturity while at the same time we gather together more of the other sheep in greater numbers than ever before. This we do so that all those who are desirous of living in the new world may have the opportunity of taking their stand now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The languages spoken by the peoples of the earth would cause some barrier, but Jehovah’s witnesses publish literature in 100 different languages and dialects to surmount this barrier. This makes it possible to have the Word of God borne to every nation, kindred and tongue and makes it possible to preach to these many nations to the ends of the earth. This fulfills Christ’s command, “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” And so during this past year, under Jehovah’s guidance this good news of the Kingdom was preached in 127 different countries or territories throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where it seems advisable to give details and figures with this report concerning the work done in certain countries, we will do so; but we are sure that our readers will appreciate, too, that it would be very unwise to give figures concerning work done in countries behind the Iron Curtain. The communistic organization is very anxious to break down the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses in countries such as Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other places; and for the Society to report how many publishers there are in these countries preaching God’s kingdom would bring harm to our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be a Christian is not an easy task in these days, nor has it been at any time since the Christian religion was introduced by Christ Jesus. Christians have always been in the minority; and the preaching of God’s kingdom by them has never been popular, because to do that means to talk about a kingdom that has come into power and will soon supplant all the governments of the earth. The Jews succumbed to the Roman government; for they cried out, “We have no king but Caesar.” Even Jehovah God was rejected as their king. But God’s witnesses in the earth today have no other God than Jehovah; and they accept Jehovah’s chosen king, Christ Jesus, as their ruler and leader now. Just as long as Jehovah God allows these governments of earth to remain, Jehovah’s witnesses will be pleased to operate under these governments, never bringing any trouble or opposition to the governments. If Jehovah allows the governments of earth to remain, why should his witnesses have any objection? Jehovah’s witnesses are not interested in overthrowing any government. But we know that in God’s due time Jehovah himself, the sovereign Ruler of the universe, will establish a universal organization, a world-wide government, for “in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed”. Then truly there will be one government for all the earth. Christ Jesus will be the ruler for Jehovah God, the great King of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses must be obedient to God’s command to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all lands. So the branch organizations look well to the preaching of this good news in order to bring comfort to those who are sighing and crying now.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The office of the president of the Watch Tower Society looks after the work outlined in the charter of the Society, namely, the preaching of the good news. This office is located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York. To this office are sent the reports from all branches and missionary homes and close watch is kept on the progress and problems in the work all over the world. The president’s office also gets reports from the office and factory of the American branch headquarters at 117 Adams Street in Brooklyn, in addition to the Kingdom Farm at South Lansing, New York, the Watchtower Farm at Staten Island and the Mountain Farm in New Jersey. All these places produce food for the big family that resides in Brooklyn. We appreciate very much what all these brothers are doing to make the lives of those at Bethel as well as their own lives more comfortable by providing good food and nourishing things for physical needs. A careful check is kept on the Gilead School and the Bethel home, and regular reports are submitted to the office of the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then, too, the Society operates radio station WBBR, which broadcasts the message of the Kingdom throughout the New York metropolitan area. Approximately 120 members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn take part in these programs, appearing in special features during the week. The Bethel home, which houses station WBBR, is really a tremendous organization in itself where all the workers from the Brooklyn factory are housed. Here they have comfortable rooms; and food is provided for them three times a day for breakfast, dinner and supper. To do this the entire organization must operate closely together so that the one important and great work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness may be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States branch office is located at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn 1, New York. All companies, all pioneers and isolated publishers in the United States make reports to this branch office regularly every month. In turn, the Brooklyn branch office makes a report to the president’s office, as do all the branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States branch has had a very successful year in advancing the Kingdom interests. There was an increase in average number of publishers in the field of 6.9 per cent, which showed that there was an average of 126,626 ministers in the field service every month. We were striving for an increase of 10 per cent in average number of publishers, and it is hoped that next year this quota will be reached and even exceeded. It certainly would be a wonderful thing if 150,000 persons who had dedicated their lives to God would be preaching the good news of the Kingdom in the United States at the time of the great assembly to be held there in the summer of 1953. That would be a wonderful witness in itself; and it is possible, because 146,786 different individuals did some preaching in the United States last year and reported through the company organizations. In fact, there were 8,332 more publishers in the United States during 1952 than during the previous year, that is, that many more different individuals. But they did not all get out into the field service during the same month. There were only 132,797 of these that got out in the field service in any one month; and that was during the month of April, 1952. This is not as great as the peak of the previous year, which was 135,356; but it is sincerely hoped that during the 1953 service year all the circuit servants, district servants, company servants, pioneers and all regular publishers will urge the weaker ones to join with them in this grand and glorious service every month. These, too, must experience the fact that there is more happiness in giving the truth to others than in just receiving it. Think of the wonderfulness of the organization if everyone would march forward and worship Jehovah in holy array. It is hoped that this will be accomplished in 1953, with 150,000 praisers of Jehovah in the United States alone. To do this, the United States branch will have a great deal to work at; but right now let us look at what the branch servant reports on the past year’s field service and, while we are doing it, plan for 1953 and our part in preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been an enjoyable privilege, Brother Knorr, to work so closely with you for another year as United States branch servant. The steady, constant expansion and the increasing unity among Jehovah’s witnesses certainly give us ample proof that Jehovah’s spirit is with his organization and is prospering it. Having a share in this vital work, I have real pleasure to submit to you a report on the activity of the United States branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big feature of our service during the year was working the unassigned territory. There were 1,290 counties or portions of counties, some not worked for twenty years, that were assigned out to companies and pioneers and were witnessed to during the summer months. The object was, of course, to plant as much seed as possible in these areas. The combined total of 924,811 books placed during June, July and August demonstrates to what extent the brothers took hold of this service. A few experiences of the hundreds reported to us will illustrate the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One family group of six (four of whom are minor children) spent three whole months in unassigned territory. They traveled 7,000 miles by car and walked many miles where the car could not go. Total placements for three months: 1,038 books and Bibles; 2,412 booklets; 946 magazines; 2 subscriptions; over 8,000 tracts; 1,400 catalogues; and 1,200 not-at-home letters, all in 2,340 hours. They were thrilled with the experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The very hostile county of Harlan, Kentucky, where in 1940 mobs raged and literature was seized—what of it? The brothers report: “The attitude of both officials and people has changed. We were graciously accepted by the people. As a group we placed about 1,500 books, plus a number of Bibles and subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Public meetings were successful, too: ‘We were able to rent the VFW hall in their little town of 400, and there were 17 persons of good will there. We are conducting the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study in a home and the results have been very fruitful, as there were 11 of good will there last Sunday, four of these being new ones. We now have seven publishers from that territory going out in the service with us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another group reports holding six public talks in five small towns, with 110 persons in attendance. One man contacted was happy to see a witness in his place for the first time in 25 years. He wanted “two subscriptions and every book you have”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some pioneers who worked in unassigned territory write that their conscience will not permit them to abandon the wonderful interest found during the summer months. They are requesting a permanent assignment to this “unassigned territory”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the most part the reception in all unassigned territories was exceptional. “We are so glad you came,” “We were waiting for you to call on us,” “Oh, we were afraid you had missed us,” were typical expressions of people who by grapevine news heard in advance of the coming of the witnesses. Brothers who participated in this unassigned territory work were thrilled, amazed and delighted with the experience, and we are thankful to Jehovah for opening up this opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following through on the good efforts of the brothers in the field, the branch office has thus far processed stencils and listed names and addresses of more than 140,000 persons in unassigned territory; and it is estimated conservatively that the total will run beyond 175,000. Over a period of several months from the time we receive the name, each person is sent a sample copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> then three special letters, followed by another copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> with invitations to subscribe.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>PROBLEMS OF LAW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil and his earthly representatives have tried to stop the work in some of these unworked places. Misguided police and public officials in such untouched places arrested over thirty different brothers in twelve different towns, charging violations of various laws declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States many years ago. Effective use of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News</span><span class="font5"> turned back the opposition in practically every case. Either the brothers arrested were released at the police station or the cases against them were dismissed by police magistrates hearing the charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While there has been no mob violence against the witness work, there were two mobs that gathered and threatened violence. The police moved in and broke up the public meetings and appeased the mobsters by accomplishing what the mobsters set out to do. The mobsters were not arrested. The mobs gathered to break up public meetings in public parks in isolated territory in Texas and Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five important cases were taken into the Supreme Court during the last service year. The court has not indicated whether it will review the cases. Three of them involved the right to hold public meetings in parks. One case is from Rhode Island, another is from New Hampshire, and the third one is from Texas. The Rhode Island case involves an ordinance of Pawtucket forbidding religious meetings in the public parks. The New Hampshire case presents a denial of a permit to hold a meeting in the public park of Portsmouth on the ground that it was a religious meeting which was not allowed. The Texas case involves an injunction order keeping Jehovah’s witnesses out of a company-owned picnic ground used as a public park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chicago blood transfusion case involving an order taking the Labrenz child away from its parents because of their refusal to consent to a blood transfusion is being presented to the court. Also another case is with the high court from Texas which involves an order made by a state judge taking a child away from the father and giving it to its mother because the father had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Although the mother had been found guilty of marital misconduct against the father, the court held that the father was not entitled to custody because of his religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of cases have been brought against Jehovah’s witnesses under the Green River law in various parts of the country. This law forbids door-to-door calling in a city or town without a prior invitation to call from the householder. Courts at Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Orlando, Florida, held that the law did not apply to Jehovah’s witnesses. It was held to be applicable and constitutional by judges at Green River, Wyoming, and other places. The Green River case is in the Supreme Court of Wyoming. These cases are very important and vitally affect the door-to-door work throughout the country. Impetus to the enforcement of this law in many parts of the country comes from the United States Supreme Court’s approval of the law when applied to the work of commercial magazine solicitors for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post.</span><span class="font5"> It is hoped that the charitable nature of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses will help us escape the impact of the Supreme Court decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of cases involving the right to build Kingdom Halls and maintain meeting places in respectable neighborhoods in different cities have been held. Some courts have held that the local officials had no right to deny permits to Jehovah’s witnesses to locate their churches in residential neighborhoods. The officials have been sustained in others. If the higher courts ultimately sustain the cities in these cases it will mean that no Kingdom Hall or meeting place can be had in any place except the slums or some other disagreeable neighborhood. It is obvious that these cases are most important and vitally affect the entire organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are a large number of miscellaneous cases that have been handled by the legal counsel for the Society during the year in addition to helping brothers who desired to make gifts and wills to the Society to assist in the world-wide preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses. These have been aided by counsel for the Society in carrying out their wishes. Many wills and gift deeds were prepared by counsel as directed by brothers and sisters who wanted to see their property used to praise Jehovah’s name during their lifetime and following their death.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">With these things so fresh in mind, we think of our more than 7,000 full-time pioneer ministers in the United States, and the opportunities that are open to push the advance of true worship. However, do all the pioneers appreciate fully this responsibility? It is apparent from the reports that too many are primarily concerned with the “hour” column on their report, and stop at the minimum. Consequently the pioneer average of hours for 1952 was considerably below minimum requirements. Therefore it should be said to all pioneers: “Don’t let the minimum-hour goal be a quitting gong!” If only all of them would appreciate they are full-time ministers in Jehovah’s organization their concern would be to praise him more and more. Let them worship by preaching and always surpass the expected minimum. Have the desire constantly for a greater share in Jehovah’s liberating work, as in the case of this eleven-year-old witness returning to school. Says he: “I started my first Bible study in August. I am so thankful I had the privilege of being born of dedicated parents, as this has been of much benefit to me. And we all look forward to the time when we can engage in full-time work. I know of no greater privilege we have. Truly we do have a merciful heavenly Father, Jehovah, and it is to him we look for everything. We must recognize him as what he is and then we must put forth every effort we can to worship and serve him.” If only more publishers and pioneers had that view! Think of what might be done to spread the good news of God’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The God-given command to assemble ourselves together was highlighted this past service year by the Washington, D.C., assembly in October, 1951. It made a great impression on the nation’s capital, with the all-time record attendance of 57,500 at Griffith Stadium and the overflow at the Sylvan Theater in the shadow of the Washington Monument. In addition to this assembly, 300 smaller circuit assemblies were held in the United States this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to be able to say, too, that the service report shows an increase on the average in every field of activity. The number of publishers is up, hours have increased, more new subscriptions were taken in the field than during the previous year, more individual magazines were placed, and more calls were made on interested people. There was only one feature of service in which the United States slipped back a little bit, and that was in the number of home Bible studies. We had about 250 less home Bible studies each month during 1952 than we did during the previous year of 1951. This we hope to correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the constant increase in the distribution of the magazines and bound books and because of the great increase throughout the world generally, it has been necessary for the printing plant at Brooklyn to</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">have its printing facilities enlarged. As all Jehovah’s witnesses know, the Society built a new addition to the printing plant in Brooklyn; and the brothers have been very busy putting it to full use during the past year. It has been necessary to install another new press to take care of the great demand for literature. A number of new machines, in addition to the press, were also installed; but we would like so say a word about this new, high-speed rotary press that we obtained. It will print not only the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines at the rate of 30,000 copies an hour, but on this same press we are able to print books and booklets at the rate of 60,000 32-page units an hour. The press is 64 tons in weight and it was necessary for us to remove a part of the wall on the sixth floor of the factory in order to install it. It was dismantled after its tryout and brought ry in large sections, some weighing as much as 17 tons. The sections of this mammoth press were hoisted from the street to the sixth floor through the opening in the wall, which measured 16 feet by 18 feet This press will aid the factory considerably in keeping up with the demand for literature from all over the world. The table of production which is printed on page 68 gives you a good comparison of what has been accomplished during the past three years in the Brooklyn printing plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We at the Brooklyn branch are very happy to fill the orders from all our fellow workers in the United States and all our brothers throughout the world, and we desire to give you good service in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do it as to Jehovah and for our brothers. We look forward to 1953 because it will mean that again visitors will be coming from all parts of the earth to the assembly in New York and to visit us in the Bethel home and the Brooklyn factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES REPORTING TO UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the Society has the opportunity new territories are opened up. The publishers in these territories report directly to the United States branch office. Scattered in different parts of the world there are now 17 small groups of Jehovah’s witnesses who are not tied in directly with any branch. Among these groups there were 764 regular publishers preaching the good news throughout the year. Assisting these company publishers were 31 general pioneers and 39 special pioneers reporting every month. There was considerable difference between the average number of publishers, which was 764 for these outlying territories, and the peak of 962 which was reached in September. There are still many possibilities for increase in these territories, because 1,960 different individuals came to the Memorial service, and during the year there were 236 baptized, to compare with the 47 who were baptized during the previous year. All these publishers devoted a total of 166,297 hours to preaching the good news. They have averaged 828 Bible studies in these locations every month during the past year. This gives an over-all picture of what has been done in these outlying places; and following is a report on each individual location, giving some of the actual experiences the publishers had. The reports all came from local publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>ADEN PROTECTORATE</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font5">About the middle of December two missionaries arrived in the little Crown colony of Aden, at the southern tip of the Moslem country of Saudi-Arabia. Aden itself has a population of about 82,000. There are a few </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine subscribers there, and it is hoped these missionaries were able to help them some in promoting the work. During the short time the missionaries were in Aden they placed 37 books and 82 booklets and obtained a number of subscriptions for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. We know that there is some seed planted in the country, and we hope that it will flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was necessary for the missionaries to leave shortly after their arrival because their entry papers were not in order for staying in that country. Perhaps we can get back in there some day with other publishers and aid the people there to see the blessings of God’s righteous government.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As in the rest of the world, people who have migrated to Alaska are easily captured by the lure of commerce. Despite this, there was a new peak of 89 publishers serving the Kingdom interests, with an average of 72 publishers who are scattered throughout the five companies in the territory and an average of six pioneers working at different places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite weather, transportation problems and isolation, the publishers in Alaska are doing well in their efforts to put up a strong fight for the faith. There is real unity among the brothers, as is shown by their desire to advance to maturity by promoting Kingdom interests above everything else. During the year they had their first organized circuit assembly at Juneau, served by a district servant from the United States. A joyful spirit prevailed and all meetings were well attended. Many brothers remarked that they no longer feel like “orphans” in so far as organizational contact is concerned, for now they have direct service from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother attending the assembly volunteered to take two Gilead graduates aboard his fishing boat for a tour of the many islands of the famed scenic “Inside Passage” of southeastern Alaska where a witness had not been given. At one Indian village of five hundred inhabitants 113 books and 82 booklets were placed and 22 subscriptions obtained, not to mention 68 magazines, all in a day and a half. From there they went on to visit many small bays and inlets where scattered fishermen, trappers and cannery watchmen were contacted, nearly all obtaining literature. One watchman joined in a study aboard ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Ketchikan a partially blind person visits a publisher’s home to study, due to opposition in his own home. The publisher reads the lessons and the blind person memorizes the information for use in tactful witnessing to his family, as well as publicly. His desire is to promote the truth among those who are mentally blind to Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alaska is yielding up men of good will to theocratic conquest, and the advance of true worship is not hindered by lack of modern facilities. The spirit of Jehovah pushes the truth into all corners of the globe, and Alaska is an integral part of that “field” in which the good news is declared.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For some time the Society was able to keep a missionary or two in the Azores to guide and direct the publishers and set a good example in witnessing. However, last year the missionary had to leave because permission to remain in the Azores was no longer granted by the government. This did not retard the work in the Azores, because now there are 29 publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom, to compare with 16 for the previous year. There are 16 Bible studies being conducted regularly every month now, to compare with 12 previously. So despite the action of the government, the truth still goes forward. Our brothers in the Azores are happy to be associated with their fellow workers world-wide in giving this good news of the Kingdom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The determination of the brothers in the Azores is to stick to the work of making known the good news, and they realize that this is what really counts. The company servant of Piedade writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When people go to a dance or some other amusement they say that they had a ‘good time’. But let me tell you that when you go out to give witness of God’s Word you really get into something far better than a worldly good time. For the past five years I have made back-calls on a very nice Catholic lady who didn’t seem to care so much for the Bible teachings. Her Bible was the everyday mass. As I thought her to be sincere and God-fearing I kept calling back on her at least once every two or three months. The last time I visited her she gave me a surprise by saying that she couldn’t stand any longer the priest’s talking about how people are going to burn in hell if they are disobedient here on earth. I slowly and calmly explained to her what the Bible hell is. The next day I happened to go by her house and went in. She said: ‘You know, I have been thinking about what you said yesterday, and now I believe you have the right religion. Your religion does not scare the people as our priest does. That doctrine of yours was so good that I went and told everything you said yesterday to my lady friend and her husband and they said that the next time you came to be sure to call on them.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another very happifying experience occurred when the Society forwarded the name of a good-will person to be called upon by the local publishers. It took two calls to contact the lady and the publisher was surprised to see that she already was conducting a Bible study with some people of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to see the work in this little island grow. Last year there were eight publishers on the average; now there are 15, with a peak of 18, and 51 individuals came to the Memorial service. All this speaks very well of progress, and the publishers in Bermuda are happy to see the advancement in Kingdom interests. It is going to take a little more time to accomplish all that Jehovah’s witnesses would like to there, but they are established and trying every avenue to preach the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah’s witnesses endeavored to obtain time to present a series of Bible discussions which have been widely broadcast elsewhere throughout the world, they were told it could be done only if the material was carefully censored to cut out comments such as, “It’s strange my minister never preached on these scriptures. . . . I’ve gone to church all my life, but never really learned too much about the Bible.” To the comment that Christ Jesus would evidently not be allowed the use of the station because of the controversial nature of his words, the manager replied: “We are not now living in the days of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless Jehovah God has decreed that the “prisoners” be freed and that people of good will be given a chance to take in the knowledge that can lead to life. It is a pleasure for Jehovah’s witnesses to work among the people of Bermuda, because the average Bermudian is a lover of the Bible and is pleased to have a home study conducted for his family. So it can truly be said of Bermuda that the harvest is great, but the workers are few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This past year has been one of progress. A short time ago the congregation grew too large for the private home where meetings had previously been held, and arrangements were made to use a hired hall. Now in three months’ time the attendance has increased by 50 per cent and the people of Bermuda see that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be stopped by deportation of their ministers as in the past or by misrepresentation. No, as long as there are people there who desire to worship God in spirit and in truth, the work will go forward.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>ETHIOPIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There has been good progress during the past service year, the second year of Kingdom preaching in Ethiopia. A new peak of publishers was reached in August with 32 going out into the field service. During the year, the first Kingdom Hall was opened, and it is hoped that before the 1953 service year rolls by a number of others will be established in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earliest record of Christian gospel-preaching to an Ethiopian is recorded in the 8th chapter of Acts, where we read of Philip’s preaching to an Ethiopian eunuch. In reading this account, one will notice three outstanding points about the Ethiopian: First, he was reading the Bible; second, he immediately asked for help; and, third, he accepted the truth rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not unusual for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> person to be contacted on the street in the morning, come to the home for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> study that afternoon, come to the company meeting in the Kingdom Hall that evening, start preaching to his neighbors the next day, and bring two or three new persons to the missionary home for Bible studies the next day. Studies have also been held with people for only two or three weeks after which they have moved to the interior and started Bible studies of their own. News has reached us from several interior villages where little study groups have been organized after these interested persons moved there. Though these persons are not counted as publishers, they may well develop into good, mature publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom some day. The seed is being planted throughout the country and we pray Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the sowing work that it may bear fruit in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A high point of the year was the arrival of eight new missionaries assigned to service with the Watch Tower mission. A two-day assembly was arranged while all the missionaries were in Addis Ababa. This proved highly enjoyable and profitable for the missionaries as well as our local publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interesting development during the year was the establishment of the Watch Tower mission night school in Addis Ababa. In order to do missionary work in this country we are required by the government to establish a regular mission and to teach school. The first school opened in Addis Ababa during this past service year and two elementary schools are now being opened in the interior by the new missionaries. We pray that many students in these schools may eventually become our brothers and fellow witnesses of Jehovah. Although we prefer regular pioneer service to school-teaching, we have accepted this requirement in order to reach the people of this country with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Three companies of Jehovah’s witnesses are established in French Equatorial Africa. During the year there was a Memorial attendance of 501 and, of these, 112 have gone out into the field service. On the average, we find 83 going out each month to carry on true worship of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They have their problems in this part of the world. Very much opposition is brought to bear against them by the various religious organizations, both Catholic and Protestant, because they do not like to see Jehovah’s witnesses coming into the territory and telling the people that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world. There are many, though, that hear this message, forsake their false religious teachings, and study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Many home Bible studies have been arranged by the few publishers there, and it is very interesting to note that the average number of hours these publishers spend in the field is 11.4 per month. The work still needs to be better organized, but those who have received a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes are anxious to keep on pushing until this good news is heard in all parts of French Equatorial Africa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society sent missionaries into Gambia some time ago, but only little progress has been made. In the city of Bathurst, it has been found that very few people will listen to the truth. At least that is the experience of the two missionaries who have worked there for quite a while. During the year, however, the message of God’s kingdom penetrated deep into the land of Gambia, because the two missionaries traveled by a river steamer, visiting the inland towns and villages. The trip was up the Gambia river and required six days to cover the distance of 500 miles. While the steamer would discharge and load cargo the publishers would go throughout the city and witness, and many very interesting experiences were enjoyed. In one trip it was possible to witness to people in every home in the little towns along the river while the steamer was docked. On the return trip, many back-calls were made, and persons were called on who had not been at home during the previous visit. During the six days, 200 items of literature were placed along the way. In Bathurst itself there are four publishers now, and since the missionaries have returned to the United States because of their health, it is hoped that the local publishers will continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom. The report for the year shows four publishers devoting 1,177 hours to field service. Even in this little spot on the earth the truth has also been preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUADELOUPE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font5">Guadeloupe is one of the islands in the Caribbean and is controlled by the French government. The Roman Catholic Church exercises strong influence on the people; but even so, good progress is being made in preaching the good news. A new peak of 81 publishers was reached, and 310 persons attended the Memorial service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is noteworthy that Jehovah’s witnesses in Guadeloupe have found that although the people appear very devout they have little appreciation for the value of Bible study. Why is that? Because they have heard the clergy speak so scornfully of the Bible, because the people have been warned against association with those who do study God’s Word, and because the clergy themselves are lacking in an accurate knowledge of the truth. Often the clergy have told their congregations not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses or to receive them in their homes or take any of their publications. In Trois-Rivieres the priest put a microphone in front of his church and told the people not to receive the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On one occasion a publisher in Basse-Terre was greeted by a Catholic priest who called him Jehovah. Of course, the publisher paused to explain that Jehovah is the name of God and that he was one of his witnesses. In the following conversation the publisher pointed out that in place of worshiping idols and images as the people have been taught to do, Jehovah’s witnesses strive to worship God in spirit and in truth. By this time quite a number of the local Catholic people had gathered around to hear the conversation; so rather than be embarrassed before them by the trend of the talk, the priest invited the brother to see him the next day in the presbytery. When the time came and the publisher was received by the bishop, to the great astonishment of the publisher he confessed he did not know the Holy Scriptures and therefore called in a missionary who was nearby. The missionary started the discussion by telling of the preeminence of Peter in the Christian church and by stating that he was the first pope and had delegated his power to his successors, even to our day and to Pope Pius XII. However, when asked to prove his assertions by the Bible he could not do so, and as the publisher overwhelmed him with Bible texts to the contrary the missionary was reluctantly obliged to state that the brother was well versed in the Scriptures. On a later call the priest had the same difficulty, not knowing the Scriptures and being confused by religious traditions, and finally said that only in Rome can these things be found in the manuscripts. He was told that even the Vatican manuscript had been made available for consultation, and that there were other texts of equal age and reliability. Seeing himself faced by the Word of God, he excused himself as having another urgent appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certainly the honest-hearted people of Guadeloupe are in need of good shepherds who will faithfully bring them the spiritual food they need. More and more people are coming to accept the truths brought to them by Jehovah’s witnesses, and now there are three active congregations in Guadeloupe. These local brothers were visited during the late summer months by the sea-faring missionaries on the “Sibia”. They gave good Scriptural talks to the various groups, encouraging them to press on in the service despite the religious opposition, and strengthening their faith in God’s Word. One of the young publishers they met sets a good example of zeal for the older brothers. She takes a bag of booklets to school with her and then during the noon hour she goes about the market and talks about the truth to those she meets, offering them some of the literature. She has excellent success for one so young and places about 140 booklets a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These faithful publishers on Guadeloupe are more determined than ever to continue proclaiming the truth and announcing the establishment of the heavenly kingdom of Jehovah through Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font5">Guam is a very pretty island in the western Pacific and is well known as the site of an American naval base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even on this little island we can find some publishers representing the theocratic organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. For the most part the publishers are from the Philippines, but at least one is from the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in October, 1951, that the publishers on Guam first met together for regular congregational study, and shortly after they were organized as a recognized company of Jehovah’s witnesses. For a time, the brothers were permitted to use the chapel for their meetings, but before long the priest complained about having the building polluted with “fanatics” and managed to persuade the director to refuse them permission to use the building. It was not long, though, before a Quonset hut was located which serves very well as a place of assembly and worship, and they are free to use it as long as they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April 10, 1952, was the date for observance of the Memorial as instituted by Christ Jesus, and the publishers were especially happy to have 18 present on that occasion. This was the first time for the celebration of the Memorial in Guam, and all the brothers demonstrated their sincerity and love for the truth by having a share during that month in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now there is one Guamanian person of good will working with them and showing his interest in Jehovah’s organization. He told them that he may be the first Guamanian to become a worshiper of the true and living God. At present he is active in preaching this good news to his fellow countrymen. Once when the priest asked him why he was no longer coming to church, he was alert to tell him of the new hope that he had and to explain the way of righteousness. Now the publishers believe that he will be used further by Jehovah in this island to explain the wonderful purposes of God to the people in their own language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been an average of 13 publishers working in Guam, with a peak of 15 reached. Wonderful things can happen if everyone who has a knowledge of the truth preaches it wherever he goes. These Philippine brothers, company publishers, have opened up new fields, which can happen in many lands. This has been done in the United States this year too. New fields were opened up by company publishers. So the work goes on to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For many years the message of the Kingdom has been preached in Iceland. Pioneers have worked particularly the capital city, Reykjavik, and many people have come to know Jehovah’s organization. But to get these people to take a stand for the Kingdom has been difficult. The publishers are still there, however, and trying hard. On an average, there were eight ministers preaching the good news every month. The zeal of these is not dampened. They are still zealous in the work and believe there is still hope for gathering other sheep in that northern island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One lady who took the book last year remarked on seeing us again, “I have read that book many times and this is what I’ve been looking for for a long time. I would like to be a member of your organization.” She, however, had her bags packed that day to leave for Europe on vacation. We have put her in touch with our brothers in Denmark, and she now writes us saying that she is glad to attend our meetings there. Before leaving, she had interested her sister and asked us to contact her and help her to understand more. This has resulted in a good Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have been endeavoring to work some of the surrounding small towns and sleeping out in a tent, but the weather has presented much difficulty. This summer has been exceptionally cold, especially so in the northern part of the country, with almost continual north winds. We are constantly in winter underwear and, except on a few rare warm days, regularly wear overcoats. While the short summer presents opportunities for covering rural territory, people are unusually busy; but in spite of this we are contacting some points of good interest with which we will try to keep in touch. The winter months will provide greater opportunities for more Bible studies, especially here in Akureyri. So we are looking forward to the establishment of the pure worship here in the north of Iceland.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">With four missionaries in Israel, Jehovah’s witnesses are trying hard to gather the other sheep. With them there are now associated ten company publishers who publish each month, and two pioneers. The Jews are returning to Israel from many countries, and among them one can find people of all tongues to talk to. The nation of Israel is trying to make the language of Hebrew the principal tongue, so our missionaries are learning that and making some progress. The Jews are a difficult people to deal with because they believe they are God’s chosen people, and they have come to this land with all kinds of ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These people were spoken of by Messiah as being steeped in tradition in his time, two thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Time has only served to deepen this, till now it is purely tradition that holds them as a people. Faith in God is lacking with many; they have turned to the evolution theory and the worship of Mammon. Each one has his own philosophy of life, doing 'that which seemeth right in his own eyes’, and for this reason no two can be dealt with in the same manner. We have not yet worked the strict orthodox section where the fanatical traditionalists live, as we want to get well established here first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nor do they want to study in the regular manner, systematically, as they feel it restricts their freedom to express themselves on whatever philosophy may suddenly come to mind, if they are to hold to one topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just this last month a German talk was arranged, and the German studies were invited, as well as some with whom we had just had discussions. Out of twenty called on, only four came, but these seemed to enjoy it. They also expressed their pleasure to be meeting other Jews who were interested. One advantage of a talk was that they had to listen the full time without interrupting; so we will try it again. After the meeting they were invited to ask questions, and when one of the women asked again about the Messiah, the only man present answered her, and did very well, too. He also said to us that we should not be discouraged about the fact that there were only four present, as he would come along next time to invite them; and he felt sure that if he as a Jew encouraged them, more would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attitude of the people is changing considerably. When we first came here many were superpatriotic and hailed the return of the Jews to Palestine as the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, but now many are beginning to see that it is only a political move. This is making some easier to talk to, but others have become so bitter that they even refuse to learn Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a nation like this, publishers cannot help but have many interesting experiences. One has to know the Scriptures in order to answer questions, because the Jews know the Hebrew text. Jehovah’s servants will continue to preach here until Jehovah says it is enough.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is with joy and gratitude that the report this year can be written directly from Korea. Jehovah has bountifully blessed the work in this land in spite of the many limitations caused by wartime restrictions and conditions. Press publicity given the Korean war declares the sufferings of the people have had no equal in history. Nevertheless, out of it all has come one fact for which we can all be thankful: The scattering of the brothers as refugees has brought the Kingdom message to various sections of South Korea and to all levels of Korean life to a degree never before attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the first two months of the service year some progress was made by the scattered brothers, who were able to make their reports to the missionaries at Nagoya, Japan. In November, after several previous applications had failed, one of the missionaries was approved by the U. S. Army for re-entry into Korea. It was a happy reunion when he arrived in Korea. After getting settled in Pusan, he set out in December on his first swing around the country to visit and aid the refugee brothers. It was most inspiring to note how most of the mature ones had survived and were now faithfully carrying on their work. This personal visit was most helpful in setting up company organizations and isolated groups of publishers, and showing them how to report their Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">December brought an all-time peak for Korea of 82 publishers. From then on there seemed to be no capping the zeal of the publishers as they discipled the poor and despairing people of Korea. Each successive month after that brought its new peak in publishers until finally 192 happy people are preaching the Word as the service year ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year four new companies were organized, in Pusan, Kunsan, Chonju and Taejon, making six companies in all. Other isolated groups are doing fine, too. Many new ones have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God during the year; 70 persons in Seoul alone. The Seoul company has increased from 10 publishers to 77 during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number of pioneers has increased also. In Korea to believe the truth is to live it, and it takes great courage to stick to the full-time work. Nevertheless, there are 13 pioneers now and they are enjoying extraordinary experiences. This is very encouraging, especially when one realizes they had no literature in Korean to distribute in the house-to-house work for the last three months, except some mimeographed pieces that were produced in Pusan. A great part of the increase in Korea this year is directly attributable to the work of these 13 faithful pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expanded activity has brought with it many unusual and interesting experiences. A clergyman of the Christian Church had become interested in Jehovah’s witnesses just prior to the war through a good friend who had become a witness. During the war he took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">refuge in</span><span class="font5"> a small town north of Taegu called Yakmok. Though out of touch with his friend, he meditated long on the subjects soul, hell, trinity, the second presence of Christ, etc., and became convinced of the truth. He had organized a new church among the villagers but he taught them the truth from the Bible. Months later after returning to Seoul and his former church he found out where Jehovah’s witnesses were holding their meetings. He resigned from his church and became a witness himself. Since then he has baptized a number of his former flock and they are serving the true God along with their former pastor. One month this former clergyman reported 140 hours as a company publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Chonju there is some opposition to the work. The Presbyterian Church published a pamphlet against us, but this has helped us rather than harmed us. It only caused more people to become curious, and then they learned the truth. Now five persons who were formerly deacons have become zealous publishers for the Kingdom. Some of these were prominent church members; so their conversion has caused a great witness in the Chonju community. The Chonju company has grown from four publishers in January to 35 in August. When the missionary brother visited the company in August, 120 persons came to the public lecture. We can expect further increases not only in Chonju and Seoul but in all places in Korea where the work is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early spring of the year the Korean brothers received a shipment of more than two tons of clothing, which was an expression of love on the part of their American brothers. The Korean brothers were greatly helped by this and many were the expressions of gratitude the Society received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were many blessings throughout the year, and to Jehovah goes our heartfelt thanks. The Society was successful in sending a new mimeograph machine into Korea, and this is now used to regularly supply the brothers with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Korean each month, as well as translated chapters from the books. Now each company has new study material each week at the meetings. This has been very badly needed, as so little of the published truth has been printed in Korean. Then, as a harbinger of many future blessings ahead of us, we began to receive from the United States our new booklet in Korean, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?</span><span class="font5"> the day before the service year ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not to be overlooked in this report from Korea are the many expressions of interest in the Society’s work from members of the United Nations’ personnel in Korea. Soldiers from several nations have written for addresses of Kingdom Halls and for literature to distribute among their Korean friends and fellow soldiers. One soldier, a medic, has taken his stand for the truth and holds a regular Bible study up on the front line and has found much interest. Another GI stationed in Pusan dedicated his life to God’s service and proved it while here by his field service. He held one of his Bible studies with a group of pharmacists in an R.O.K. hospital. Since his return to the States he has continued his good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the service year the living conditions in Korea are not good. There is a great scarcity of food. Inflation has rendered many families underfed; in fact, most people eat only once or twice a day and at that their rations are scanty. On the other hand, those who have put their trust in Jehovah have been greatly blessed with spiritual provender, which they know is of more importance and lasting value than material food. The publishers in Korea have been made strong, and now, come what may, their confidence is in Jehovah of hosts. On his side they take their stand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Located on the west coast of Africa between Freetown, Sierra Leone, B.W.A., and the Ivory Coast, is the country of Liberia, a little republic that was settled by freed slaves from the United States, through the American Colonization Society. It is the only Negro republic in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we look back over the service year’s report our hearts rejoice as we consider the strange way Jehovah continues to expand his work here in this little republic. Through the lack of employment many brothers have been forced to leave Monrovia and return to their homes far into the interior where there is no mail service, which means Monrovia company is increasing though the reports seem to decrease. Now and then someone from the interior visits Monrovia and brings a letter and reports from some isolated brothers, sometimes covering five or six months’ activity in preaching and conducting Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of those in the interior are very superstitious and worship such things as mountains, water, trees, fish, etc., even making animal sacrifices to such. Not long ago one of the members of a certain tribe who had taken the truth since living in Monrovia visited his relatives in his home. He arrived just as the tribe was in the midst of preparation for a sacrifical ceremony. He tried to witness to them about the truth, but they would not listen. In fact, the whole town turned against him and warned him that if he refused to participate in the ceremonies when they returned from the sacrifice he would be dead. Of course, such was not the case, but they were still skeptical. However, a day later another of the tribe who had become a publisher also came home, and the two of them proceeded to give the whole town a good witness. Using nothing but the Bible, they read and explained the Scriptures to the people. A great witness was effected and a Bible study was held with the whole town each week until the two publishers returned to Monrovia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government seal of Liberia says, “The love of liberty brought us here.” However, the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses went into Liberia was to give them full liberty and freedom to enter into God’s kingdom. Even Liberia will become a part of God’s universal organization and all the Armageddon survivors there will have the opportunity for everlasting life. Now there are, on the average, 59 regular publishers proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom in Liberia, and we hope and pray that the truth will enter into the uttermost parts of the land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Catholic countries there is not the freedom of speech that we have in Protestant countries. Since this is true in Portugal, one must be careful how he carries on the work. Of course, individuals are allowed to talk. But to have meetings generally and give real publicity to God’s kingdom as the only hope for the world is not too welcome in Portugal. In spite of this, the preaching of the good news by Christians forges ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year, when two of the missionaries were away and the third was in poor health, certain unruly elements seized the opportunity to cause trouble. Criticism of the Society, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and the local organization caused a serious rift in the Lisbon company. The attendance at meetings and the service activities dropped. The number of publishers dropped from a peak of 72 in July 1951 to 33 in January 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most timely, therefore, was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel. On Saturday night, February 2, they arrived by plane from Madrid. Next morning the missionaries, servants and complainers were called together by Brother Knorr, who gave the matter a full hearing. Two who showed a rebellious spirit were sharply reprimanded. That afternoon, at a combined meeting of the two local companies in Almada (just across the Tagus river), further counsel and admonition were given by both visiting brothers to an attentive audience of 122, The unity of Jehovah’s organization and the privilege of ministry were especially stressed. The following day various matters relative to the organization were discussed and problems solved. The same evening a goodly number of brothers crowded out the small Lisbon hall and thrilled to the experiences of Brothers Knorr and Henschel as they described their journey in the East. A few hours later the two visitors were winging westward through the night to their journey’s end in Brooklyn. They left behind a group of Kingdom publishers chastened, admonished, but vastly helped and encouraged by their visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reactions were swift. A small rebellious section of the Lisbon company broke away, but at once meeting attendance began to go up, reaching a peak on Memorial day with 159 for the two companies. The number of publishers, too, began to rise, although here progress was necessarily slower. However, by the year’s end the number of publishers had almost reached the peak of the previous year, thus repairing the damage caused by the dissension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the results of Brother Knorr’s visit was the sending of two young brothers from the Rio de Janeiro Bethel home to Lisbon to serve as special pioneers and to help in theocratic construction work. They arrived in June and, together with another special pioneer from Brazil who came of his own accord, form a very useful reinforcement of the Kingdom forces in Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the year’s end the number of Bible studies conducted by the missionaries and pioneers in the Lisbon area is 68. Among all the studies with these prospective “sheep” are some interesting ones, including studies with teachers, doctors, a dentist, an architect and a playwriter. One new group study was started in this unusual way: A missionary left his Bible on a park seat and, since it was a treasured copy, he passed a miserable day thinking it was lost. But at the meeting that night a stranger handed it back. On calling back on the person who found it, the missionary discovered he was a lad with whom a year previously he had placed three booklets but who had always been out on the return visit. Real interest was shown, leading to the formation of a new group. Quite a number of new groups are springing up in various parts of the city of Lisbon and also in country districts, notably Rio</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maior, Beja and various places in the north of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers in Portugal have every cause to be grateful to Jehovah for his blessings and for the faithful ministry and unstinting support of his loyal “slave” organization. At the beginning of a new year of service, with two missionaries, seven special pioneers and some 60 publishers in the field, the local theocratic organization is stronger than ever before and faces the future with optimism, confident that there are yet many more “prisoners” to be released in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>ST. MARTIN, F. W. I.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are three publishers on this island where French is spoken, and these brothers are doing good work in preaching the Kingdom message. Sixty persons attended the Memorial service. The Society’s schooner, the “Sibia”, visits here from time to time, and the brothers report a very interesting eight-day call at St. Martin. They had a service meeting the evening preceding the Memorial, with 30 in attendance. Much good information was given by the crew of three members of the “Sibia”, who are traveling ministers, to the congregation and to the servants in charge of the work there. Another meeting was arranged after the Memorial service for the benefit of those who were interested in field service, and good instruction was given to a large public attendance. The whole week the “Sibia’s” crew spent on this island was one of great joy, for they were busy instructing the local publishers how to carry on the work in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“SIBIA”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Sibia” is a floating missionary home. Some may wonder why this heading, “Sibia.” It is merely the name of a boat, but its territory is all over the Caribbean. Very much good work has been accomplished by the ministers who operate it.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font5">It is now nearly four years that the Society has maintained a missionary schooner in the West Indies. Its one purpose is to carry life-giving Kingdom truth to the smaller islands of the Caribbean, islands where, as yet, such vital information has not penetrated very far. The three Gilead graduates who operate the “Sibia” have had many joyful experiences during the past year when they touched in at most of the islands in their territory on at least two occasions. The time spent at the various places ranges from perhaps two days to three weeks, depending on such factors as the time available, the size of the island and the interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effect of work done from the “Sibia” is now being seen as people of good will continue to manifest themselves as lovers of righteousness by attending meetings and group studies and sharing in Kingdom activity with the missionaries in a number of places. Where no companies exist the missionaries endeavor to establish a group study by getting the interested persons together and concentrating their efforts on the more capable ones so that somebody can be left in charge of the study while the boat is away at the other islands. This arrangement is working very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is good interest in the British Virgin Islands, particularly on Tortola, the largest of this colony. A young woman was contacted and she studied diligently, marking all the answers in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work”.</span><span class="font5"> It was not long before she found herself walking up to the market with two other publishers and the missionaries, all wearing magazine bags and a Kingdom smile, much to the consternation of the inhabitants. It was an inestimable joy for the missionaries to see this young woman, previously led into a careless life, submit to water baptism a few weeks later. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, a service meeting and a group study were started here, with attendances of up to thirty persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distance traveled by the “Sibia” this year was 2,571 miles, an even greater distance than the previous year. The time at sea was 35 days, and the time in port was 330 days. Twenty-seven different ports were visited, in 21 islands, with a total of 73 entries or return visits to these various ports. The missionaries did 3,731 hours actual field service, making 1,730 back-calls, conducting 297 Bible studies, and putting on 50 public meetings, with an attendance of about 3,000 persons. They now look forward to another year crammed full of Kingdom privileges and an increased shout of praise from the tiny isles of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA LEONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With a new peak of 73 engaging in the proclamation of God’s kingdom, the organization in Sierra Leone is very happy. The work has moved ahead very well during the past year, and an excellent witness has been given.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font5">Sierra Leone is an impressive country: 28,000 square miles of natural beauty. The people are very friendly and humble. Almost all realize the great value of education and will read any printed matter available, even advertisements. Many are taking advantage of the free Bible educational work of Jehovah’s witnesses and are asking for home Bible studies. Often some who are unable to read obtain literature and have the witnesses or visitors read to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Handbills have been very helpful not only in advertising the public lectures but also in announcing different publications available to the public. Many placements of literature have been made as a result of this feature. One Sunday as one of the pioneers was returning from the field a person handed him a handbill with his name and address neatly written on the coupon, making inquiry about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font5"> stating: “I’m prepared to send the 2/6 to your office, you know.” The pioneer replied, “I have that book with me now; I can save you considerable time and expense.” The result was an arrangement for a Bible study to be started in two weeks’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With confidence we can say that the prospects for Kingdom expansion in Sierra Leone are very bright. The last two months saw two new peaks in publishers and back-calls. Bible studies reached a new peak in August. Already the Kingdom Hall is too small for the attendance at public meetings and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">studies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the civil war in Spain and during World War II, there was very little work done in Spain as far as witnessing about the Kingdom is concerned. In 1947 the work came to life again with ten publishers reporting. Since that time the work has moved ahead, not dramatically, but steadily, until this year, when 145 publishers engaged in field service. This is a new peak for Spain. And these publishers are very happy that they have the opportunity of comforting those who mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the important factors concerning the increase in the work there is the fact that some special representatives of the Society were able to visit those who were interested. Some brothers are able to visit the companies regularly and serve them as do circuit servants in other countries. During the past year Brothers Knorr and Henschel were able to pay a visit to the brothers in Barcelona and Madrid. The visit was very brief, only three days for the two cities. But it was very fruitful in spiritual benefits. The organization in Spain was improved, and it was possible for the brothers to talk to many who are interested in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When they arrived in Barcelona, a meeting was held and 33 Christians were able to attend. During the second day in Barcelona, a number of meetings were conducted in the different homes of the brothers, and appropriate counsel was given to 90 different persons, who appreciated this visit very much. The two brothers then went on to Madrid, where a number of other meetings were held, and publishers were there from Toledo and Torralva. It was a happy meeting and brought back memories of previous occasions. One of the immediate results of the visit of the president of the Society was that Spain would now be served by a circuit servant. A minister of the gospel is able to go around to the various groups of publishers and give them spiritual comfort and aid in the preaching of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another field that was opened up was that of special pioneer service. Some of the brothers are now able to devote much of their time to preaching and ministering to those who need comfort. It is indeed a pleasure for these, along with company publishers, to go about in their territory, preaching with the Catholic Bible and showing the people all the good things that Jehovah God has in store for them. It certainly is a joy to all of us to know that 237 persons were able to attend the Memorial service in April. Only eight of those present partook of the emblems, so this shows that the greater portion of those in Spain are of the other sheep class, people that desire to live through into the new world and enjoy the blessings of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness under the reigning King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are a happy group, but they do have trials and difficulties. The conditions under which they work are quite difficult. The Scriptures caution us that a witness of Jehovah must be as careful as a serpent and as innocent as a dove. So the work of gathering the other sheep goes on.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It may be forbidden to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but one cannot stop God’s servants from preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Even though the Argentine government has banned the Society, still there are more people preaching the good news today in Argentina than there were a year ago. Jehovah’s Word tells us we will meet up with many problems in getting the gospel of the Kingdom preached, but the slaves of God do not run away from problems. They face them, overcome them and go right on doing the will of Jehovah. It is hard work, but they do it. Lovers of truth and righteousness are not afraid to take a stand for righteousness, and Jehovah’s people throughout the world are delighted to be associated with them. So the work goes on in Argentina quietly but steadily in the same manner as it is carried on in the rest of the world. During the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> campaign, the publishers met with wonderful results. They set their quota for two subscriptions for each publisher and went far over it. What does this prove? It proves that it can be done, even though the brothers are suffering persecution. In Argentina, God’s servants are worshiping Jehovah in holy array. The branch servant gives a very interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To appreciate what a semimonthly back-call by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> can do in carrying on the organization with the Word and the spirit is clearly manifest in the expression of the isolated good-will person who wrote to you, Brother Knorr, and said, among other things: “For three months now I have been receiving a free </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. . . </span><span class="font5">. please help me to contact Jehovah’s witnesses. ... I confess that I would like to be a missionary during my spare time and take the knowledge I have, and may obtain, to my friends and relatives. I am very happy with the knowledge that came to me through the magazine. . . . Please give heed to my request and put me in contact with the Society and the witnesses in this country if there are any.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This and many other similar expressions show how appropriate and timely Jehovah was in providing for the unassigned territory campaign. This has been another high light of our activity for the year, and it is still going on. Our unassigned territory is not comprised of rurals and villages, but of main cities and whole states. It is surprising to say that the second-largest city in the country, just across the stream that divides it from the city of Buenos Aires, was part of the unassigned territory, and was taken over by two of the units of the Buenos Aires company. When we heard of your offer of Maine territory to Florida publishers, we were inclined to inquire if some could not come this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The months of June, July and August in our territory are full winter months. Taking this into account, we tried to place the unassigned territory campaign in another milder season, but that could not be done without affecting other campaigns, and especially so the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign, which is in summer. With no alternative and remembering the counsel at Ecclesiastes, “He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,” we passed to the companies all the information regarding the campaign just as it came, and wondered what the reaction would be. Although some territory requests were rather slow in coming, the majority were eager and immediately responded, despite the wintertime. Seeing this we carried on with the rest of the arrangements, printing forms and letters. The results very soon manifested that Jehovah’s blessing was on the work. We remind you that for over two years we have had no large gatherings, so these outings provide a stimulant for the brothers and have been a great help to new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present our good-will follow-up record files are running well over 3,000 names from more than 100 towns and cities which showed no previous record of work. The joy of the brothers has been great on contacting isolated sheep, and many homes were opened for Bible studies and lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the first house in a village a publisher was told: “This is the same religion my friend who lives here has.” It could hardly be believed, but it was found that the person had been a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriber for fourteen years but had not been contacted due to the distance. She received her magazines in the post office. However, she had not been idle, and all the village knew about Jehovah and his witnesses. In another case a publisher was told to go to a hotel “because they believe like you do”. And sure enough, the owner had been a publisher over twenty years ago in Europe and had lost all contact with the Society. He was extremely happy on being informed of the work and its progress in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The activity in Argentina under the circumstances is hard work for the circuit servants. They are talking to small groups somewhere almost every day or night. One circuit servant reported fifty different service and Bible talks in eight weeks. Newly interested ones at Bible lectures are always well over 100 per cent of the publishers present and that with only private invitations. One rural company of 29 publishers reported that 130 attended two Bible lectures during the circuit servant’s visit, some traveling over twenty miles to be present. Persons with whom studies are held for six or seven weeks request talks to be given in their homes for their friends. An ex-Evangelist pastor, after hearing one of these talks which he had arranged for his home, expressed himself in these words: “I have given many talks myself, but not according to knowledge.” He is now a meek </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bible</span><span class="font5"> student. Years back it was a problem to open homes for home Bible studies; now it is a problem to attend to them. Often one new study is the first link of a chain of many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By striving for maturity we have reached good results in all features of the service, but there is a real need for more and more help. We hope to have it some day. We are happy that three of our pioneers are invited to Gilead. Many others are making efforts to study English in order to qualify, but this will not supply our great need. We know Jehovah is a provider and he will see that the way is opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With such a blessed service year and another one abundant in work ahead of us to be climaxed with the international assembly in New York, this next year will fly. Many are planning to be at the assembly. May God be with you all till we meet there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<div><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-3.png" alt="" style="width:129pt;height:83pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The work in this country has progressed wonderfully well during the past service year. We find a 12 per cent increase in number of publishers, and they now have an average of 5,716, with a new peak of 6,168. The publishers are very enthusiastic about the isolated territory assignments, but their problem is probably greater than that in other countries because of the tremendous area they have to cover. Many of their towns and hamlets are quite far distant from centers where Jehovah’s witnesses live. Here, too, the company publishers shared in missionary work and got out into territory not covered before. The branch servant gives us a very interesting report, and excerpts from it are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With a country almost as large as the United States and only million people, the big problem to overcome is distance and isolation. Thousands of sheep stations scattered over the Australian “outback”, the large cities and many smaller towns located on the coastal ribbon around the country, not to mention hundreds of towns and hamlets extending well into the interior, all constitute a heavy but joyful responsibility resting upon the publishers. Time and again as we surveyed this vast territory it brought home to us the hard work that would be required in order to give a thorough witness. Often the questions turned over in our minds: When will the message really penetrate into every part of this continent? Shall we have to wait until more pioneers are available and willing to go into the many isolated areas which either provide much virgin territory or else have not been worked for many years ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problem of distance is being solved and our questions are being answered. This has come as a result of the most outstanding single feature of the service year: unassigned territory work. Once we knew the campaign was in the offing preparations began immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never has a campaign in this land absorbed the attention of the publishers so much and been entered into with such widespread enthusiasm. It has been a real challenge, but the response and spirit manifested show the publishers have unwaveringly met it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to describe more than a small fraction of the things accomplished. Many of the units in Australia’s five largest cities requested territory 200300 miles away. Other companies have gone as far as 500 miles, spending three or four weeks to complete their assignments before returning home. One pioneer group has been working up to 1,000 miles away from their home base. So distance does not stop those who love Jehovah. A small company recently organized holds a permanent territory assignment that stretches out for 600 miles. Imagine how far they have traveled to unassigned territory. And for a circuit assembly! Well, the last one they attended required them to make a round-trip journey of more than 3,600 miles. They witnessed en route and enjoyed every bit of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Work in unassigned territory has resulted in thrilling experiences more numerous than ever. While witnessing at sheep stations a pioneer brother called at a place where he recalled having left some literature back in 1933. After a brief conversation the householder was able to recollect the previous visit. This time all the latest books were placed and subscriptions obtained for both magazines. Arrangements were also made to witness to the aboriginal employees. As the publisher was leaving, the host and hostess accompanied him to the gate and with beaming faces said they hoped another nineteen years would not pass before the brother was able to revisit them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young American and his wife, who are out here studying biology, anthropology and social conditions, noticed many of Jehovah’s witnesses on the streets of a small town in isolated territory. They wanted to know how our work was progressing in Australia and told the publisher with whom they were conversing: “You are a powerful organization in the States, and I am glad to see your work here.” Both he and his wife later came out to the public meeting and were very much impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many placements of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> have been made and one experience shows how it is being appreciated. Making a back-call in unassigned territory a brother called on a businessman and asked how he liked his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> of the Bible. The reply was: “It’s great! I like it very much; and what is more, you will be glad to know that my wife reads from it every month to an assembly of women at the Methodist church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The benefits of unassigned territory work are inestimable. The publishers have had their outlook on service broadened; experiences have enriched their lives. A tremendous amount of seed has been sown and that which has fallen on good soil represents a big potential for future increase. Our joy knows no bounds. One company servant put it this way: “Our joys are at fever pitch here and one cannot help but feel it may be a regular feature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot help but express ourselves in appreciation for the rich, clear and penetrating truths presented so faithfully in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Without these truths the gratifying transformation toward maturity now discernible among the publishers would not have been possible. In this day when our dedication and personal relationship to Jehovah mean so much and the Kingdom work expands to its foretold dimensions, heavy responsibilities and glorious privileges must be shouldered and taken care of by Christians who are mature. Hence the past year has been one of steady, hard work and study, stressing and gaining maturity, cleaning out improper practices, strengthening the field organization, consolidating our gains, and taking greater strides forward by branching out into new fields of untouched territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With such a background, and with fresh, stimulating experiences provided by the vigorous campaign in unassigned territory, we now look forward to our district assemblies. Like a band of valiant warriors returning home from battle to celebrate their victories, so we, as Jehovah’s witnesses, will gather at these assemblies, radiant with joy over God-given successes, thankful to Jehovah for his blessings and leadings, and ready to perform further duties in new world service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>FIJI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">We are very happy to see the progress made in the Fiji Islands. There has been a steady increase in number of publishers, until now there are 30 on the average, and they have a peak of 37. We can see that the work is growing, but it is going to take hard work to continue that growth. It is hoped that more publishers will move into the Fiji Islands and make it their home to strengthen the company there. Papua and the Samoan Islands, American and Western, were three territories newly opened; and these, along with Fiji, come under the direction of the Australian office. Their reports are set out in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite their problems and seeming isolation, there are many things that have made the publishers glad. For example, there was a 15 per cent increase in the average number of publishers. Another thing over which they rejoice is that three local publishers joined the pioneer ranks. This happy trio, all Eurasians, are doing well. Being young and energetic, their enthusiasm is winning the hearts of many to look into God’s Word and learn of the new world. An outstanding example of this can be seen in the results attained by working among patients and nurses at the hospital for tuberculosis. In the course of advertising a public meeting the pioneer sister met a Fijian nurse who was of good will. The nurse could not come to the public meeting but did attend the ministry school at the Kingdom Hall. She became so impressed with the effective method of study that she gladly accepted an invitation to have a private study at the nurses’ quarters in the hospital. Upon going to the study the following Sunday morning, the pioneer found, much to her surprise, not only the nurse but eventually 39 others assembled in the recreation room. This 16-year-old pioneer sister felt quite nervous; however, she did not excuse herself, but spoke to the whole gathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being somewhat isolated the little band of faithful witnesses in Fiji are always glad to welcome into their midst visiting brothers from overseas. At the beginning of the service year, a pioneer family from New Zealand was with them for a while. During their brief stay it was possible for them to cover the island of Ovalau, about 75 miles from Suva which is on the main island. Some literature was left and the interest found is now being cared for by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In January, two weeks before a disastrous hurricane struck the islands, the publishers had the pleasure of having the company of 17 Australian pioneers who were en route to begin the February term at Gilead. The missionary brother tells us how much this meant to them and what they did on the week end: “Saturday being the market day for Suva, and also our ‘magazine day’, our Australian brothers joined us in the morning street work. Many fine comments were made by the local people, a mixed population of Fijians, Indians, Europeans, Chinese, as well as other Pacific islanders. Their verbal and facial expressions were summed up in the thought, ‘Why, Jehovah’s witnesses are all over town this morning.’ In the afternoon we all crowded into the Kingdom Hall, where we had nearly two hours of fellowship together, exchanging experiences and singing Kingdom songs. A real tonic for those of us in Fiji! A few tears were shed upon the departure of our Australian brothers. Our good wishes go with them wherever they may be assigned following their course of study at Gilead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, all the publishers in Fiji are looking ahead as they commence the new service year with one missionary, three pioneers, a few more mature publishers in the company, together with many people of good will that need to be helped and trained.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>PAPUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory of Papua, which makes up a part of the large island of New Guinea located to the northeast of Australia, was opened up during the service year when two publishers took up residence there. For newcomers to the territory it takes time to become acclimated to the tropical heat which bears down during the long summer period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lack of adequate transport presents many difficulties and considerable walking has to be done in this mountainous territory. Most of the work thus far has been centered mainly in the principal town of Port Moresby, where most of the European population is to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many friends have been made with the natives despite language barriers, which consist of many different dialects. It is possible, however, to converse with most of the tribes by speaking the Police Motu, which the publishers are concentrating on and trying to pick up. A study is now being conducted with a Papuan woman who speaks English, and she is anxious to witness to her native friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the first time the Memorial was celebrated in Papua, with six in attendance, including three natives. During the coming year, it is hoped that an increase will take place as a result of the efforts put forth by the two publishers in sowing the seed of truth. No doubt there are some among the carefree native people as well as among the white population who will respond to the Good Shepherd’s voice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>SAMOA, AMERICAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the service year a pioneer was able to spend some time working on the island of American Samoa. The name of Jehovah’s witnesses sounded very strange to many of the people there. Some disliked the idea of a “new religion” and scoffed at the witness being given. Others wanted to know what Jehovah’s witnesses believed and what they knew about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One person of good will has experienced much opposition from those who have tried to stop him from taking in knowledge. Often as a study was being conducted with him at night, relatives would switch off all the lights, but the Bible discussion would continue right on just the same. One day this person’s uncle came into his room and saw him reading the Bible and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> “How come?” he said. “This is the first time I have seen you with a Bible.” The newly interested person then explained about the study he was having, and added: “There’s no such thing in the Bible called a trinity: three persons in one, one in three, equal in everything.” Later this uncle received a further witness from the pioneer sister, obtained magazines, soon stopped going to church, and has borrowed a copy of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </span><span class="font5">and is now studying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One person of good will who was a patient in the Samoan hospital borrowed the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Let God Be True” </span><span class="font5">from a friend. On opening the book he saw many interesting subjects listed in the contents and his eyes came to rest on the chapter entitled “The Sabbath: In Shadow and Reality”. After reading that chapter he was so happy to learn the truth from God’s Word about the sabbath. He wished he could own a wonderful Bible help such as the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> He wrote to the Society but felt he might not be cared for and thought he would never find a book like that for himself; so he planned to copy the whole book by hand. He started with the chapter he first read. Then, one Sunday, he had the great pleasure of meeting one of Jehovah’s witnesses and obtaining books, booklets and magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the few months during which the pioneer has been working in American Samoa a number of sheep have been found, their thirst for righteousness is being satisfied and the prospects for more praise to Jehovah in American Samoa are much brighter indeed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>SAMOA, WESTERN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For the first time in many years, one of Jehovah’s witnesses landed in Western Samoa, there to take up a secular job. He also found a rich field for giving the Kingdom witness to those searching for truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 80,000 inhabitants in Western Samoa and they go all out in their practice of religion. Where would this lone witness start his preaching work? How would the truth begin to affect the Samoans now? Here is how things started. Working in the same office with the brother was a native Samoan. One day he handed the brother a message which stated that in view of the fact that the brother had registered as a member of the International Bible Students Association someone wished to have a talk with him on the Bible. The Samoan also became very curious. So a study was started with him on the subject of the trinity and continued every night for a fortnight; finally he was convinced. This person is quite well respected, as his relations for many past years have been pastors for the London Missionary Society. Consider what a triumph for the true religion it was when this Samoan accepted the truth. His hunger for Bible knowledge was incredible. He read and studied every publication the publisher had and then proceeded to escort him on preaching missions. The results in a few months were amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News gets around quite rapidly on a small island; so when a deacon of the Samoan Congregational Church heard of this first study being conducted he asked to join in. The publisher relates what then took place: &quot;The deacon took copious notes during the study and stayed up to the early hours of the morning rereading the scriptures he had taken down while studying the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font5"> He then invited our first Samoan witness and me to a Bible debate on the trinity with the head pastor of his church. This was arranged for and by Jehovah’s grace a convincing witness was given that evening. Now this deacon and his eldest son have announced that they are firmly for the faith of Jehovah’s witnesses. Their zeal since that time has borne this out and already four of their contacts are interested in the truth. The Pentecostals have published a vicious attack in Samoan on Jehovah’s people accusing them of being murderers in Africa. Since then this deacon has been condemned from the pulpit for accepting the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note that in only five short months of work on the island the number of those sharing in telling out the good news has jumped from one to ten. As these newly interested ones become well grounded in their fundamental knowledge of God’s Word and continue to let their light shine, no doubt there will be many more honest persons freed from the darkness and bondage holding them as prisoners in the Babylonish system, which even now is shaking under the relentless onslaught of solid truths pelting it from every side.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark124"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The country of Austria has been overrun by armies many times. The people have had a large share of sorrow and distress. But Jehovah’s witnesses are in Austria and are happy to take to these distressed people a comforting message. Many are receiving it. It is good to see the increase in the number of other sheep who are associating themselves with Jehovah’s organization. To be exact, they had an increase of 9.6 per cent, and there are now 2,772 regular publishers in the field, with a peak of 2,937. Many attended the Memorial service, the number being 4,350. The brothers in Austria are very zealous in trying to help all in that land to gain a knowledge of the truth. Like others of Jehovah’s witnesses, they went out into new, unassigned territory and had wonderful results. There are now 160 companies organized. The branch servant tells us some of the good experiences the publishers enjoyed in Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had an increase of only 10 per cent in publishers, but it may be said that those who faithfully engaged in the work have gained maturity. This was obvious during the summer campaign when great efforts were made to reach the unassigned territory. Some publishers worked overtime purposely to earn sufficient money for the regular railway or bus trips into the country; others went on their bicycles for hours, and some in hilly territory had to walk sometimes as much as five hours one way in order to reach the people. From all parts of the country it was reported that the opposition of the clergy was very strong, and real maturity and much theocratic tact were needed to deliver the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one village the circuit servant had to give the public talk in a private kitchen. Twenty persons came and listened with great interest. When the brother explained how necessary it was to get a full understanding of God’s purpose as expressed in the Bible, they understood him well, and six persons subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> straight away after the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A farmer who was very much interested in the truth, but still a member of the Roman Catholic Church, met the clergyman on the road. This one asked him at once when he was going to pay his church tax that had been due for a long time. The farmer quickly used this opportunity to put the clergyman to the test. So he said: “You have now a chance to earn half of my church taxes if you prove to me from the Bible that man has an immortal soul dwelling in him. But I am not going to pay anything if you can’t prove it.” The priest was bewildered and replied he could not do that in the street, but he agreed to visit the farmer in his home. He really came and tried to make an impression with his philosophy. However, the farmer simply opened his Bible and showed the clergyman Ezekiel 18:4. “This is a spurious Bible!” shouted the priest with great anger, and he insisted upon this although the farmer showed him that it was translated by the Roman Catholic priest Leander van E. “Well,” said the farmer smiling, “we have still another Bible we can examine,” and his wife brought a Bible that was carefully wrapped in paper. Again they looked up Ezekiel 18:4, and when the clergyman read, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die,” he shouted still more excitedly, “This is also a spurious Bible!” The farmer smiled again, and said: “We shall see what Bible this one is.&quot; He opened the cover, and on the first page there was written the clergyman’s own name. It was his own Bible, which the farmer had borrowed for this discussion. But he had done it through another person to take him by surprise. The clergyman, pale as death, snatched his Bible out of the farmer’s hands, and left the house cursing and swearing. Now the farmer was fully convinced of having the truth, and openly took his stand for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer had much joy when he was sent to assist a small and weak company. Already in the first month he was able to arrange 12 Bible studies. One of these was with a very intelligent young woman whose seven-year-old son was also very much interested. After the first study she came to the meeting with the boy, and at the next study she subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> When she saw the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font5"> she said: “I must have it, I have to learn so much.” A nun had been her close friend for years, and tried everything to bring her back to the church. But the woman stood firm and courageously defended the true worship. She soon became a very zealous publisher and symbolized her dedication by immersion at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has brought already a detailed report of our congress, when you, dear Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel, visited us, I should like to use this opportunity to express my appreciation and gratefulness for your visit. The congress, just at the beginning of this service year, was like the first step on the way to maturity. When you visited us the first time, in 1933, only a few hundred attended the meeting, while more than 4,400 were gathered at the congress last September. There have been 449 immersed this year, 197 of these at the congress alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I also want to express my deep gratitude for the great shipment of the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> you sent to us. Besides that we printed here by your permission the two booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are fully aware of the great privilege to serve Jehovah in this place, and pray for his blessing upon you and all his people on earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are 20 inhabited islands that make up the Bahamas group. The Society has established a branch office in Nassau. Jehovah, in his Word, has emphasized the fact that when an organization is clean and practices true worship, his blessing will be upon it. Prosperity is assured. But when someone in the congregation cannot live properly, according to the Scriptural arrangement of God, it brings reproach on the organization. Then, too, when there is internal dissension, backbiting and troublemaking, it slackens the preaching of the good news. True worship of the Almighty God does not allow for trouble among the brothers. If we love our brothers, we have evidence that we love our God. There is no one that can say he loves God when he does not love his brothers who are serving God. It is well to keep these principles in mind, because it may happen in any company of Jehovah’s witnesses, and no one wants to see the work retarded. All desire to see true worship promoted with all working together in peace and unity. Because of the difficulties encountered during the past service year, the work has declined in the Bahamas. But before the year ended this trouble had all been cleared away and matters straightened out; so we look forward to greater progress during 1953. The average number of publishers dropped from 110 to 93. Those who are remaining are not discouraged, but they are determined to find the other sheep and continue to dwell together in unity. The branch servant makes the following report concerning some of the things that happened in the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the district assembly a splendid talk on “World Unity—Is It'Just a Dream?” was given by Brother Adams from your office. This talk was widely advertised by means of news releases to the radio and newspapers as well as by window signs, placards and handbill distribution. The public meeting was attended by 307, and this during the hottest season of the year, and all gave undivided attention to the speaker. Many were deeply impressed by the information served and commented favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the district assembly program a faithful colored sister who has pioneered here since 1933—she is 74 years of age and puts in from 90 to 130 hours a month—gave us an interesting outline of the history of the organization in this country during her time. It has been a long, hard struggle since she arrived in 1926. There were four publishers in the country, all residing in Nassau. At one time during those years the figure dropped to two in attendance at meetings. These two did not give up, but continued to hold their meetings regularly and gradually a few more associated themselves with the little group. Then in 1942 a zealous and consistently active brother was murdered in his store when he surprised burglars at work. This was a blow to the work, as the populace are of fearful and superstitious minds. Then, too, there was the import ban on the literature for a period of four years during World War II. Some became fearful and ceased to associate. Through all this she and a few others remained steadfast and continued in their Godgiven right of preaching. Today she is happy and thankful for her patient endurance, for now there is a good group of publishers in Nassau and on two of the “out islands” there are publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the spring of 1947 the Society sent four Gilead graduates to the Bahamas to aid the five publishers then reporting. In March thirteen publishers reported, and at the end of that same service year a peak of twenty-two publishers had been reached. Since that time literally hundreds of Bible studies have been conducted in the homes of the people, some of the missionaries conducting as many as 24 or 25 Bible studies a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One man with whom a full-time servant had studied two chapters in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”:</span><span class="font5"> “What Is Man?” and “Hell, a Place of Rest in Hope”, was asked if he had any questions on the subjects. His answer was, “How can I? It’s too straight. I’ve been reading these same scriptures for years and never had them lined up like this. For the first time in my life I know what they mean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two persons with whom two missionaries study were working in the same office. A discussion on the soul began, and soon they both were expounding what they had learned on the subject. A fellow worker asked where they had learned so much about the subject. When both replied that they were studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, she asked them if these people would study with her. The missionaries lost no time in seeing that she was contacted and a study started.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Those worshiping Jehovah in holy array during 1952 have had a most delightful time. Our fellow workers in Belgium have experienced a 13 per cent increase in the average number of publishers in the service compared with the previous year. Even though there has been considerable persecution on the part of the clergy, it has not dampened the zeal of the faithful Kingdom publishers. It has not lessened their joy. Their happiness has been full to overflowing because they continue to give of the water of life freely. Their peak of publishers, which they reached in June, was 3,304, and all of them are happy in their privilege of representing Jehovah God and speaking in behalf of the King and the Kingdom. The branch servant sent in an interesting report, and brief excerpts are here printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The joys and blessings of our service year were increased by the campaign in the unassigned territories during the last three months. The brothers participated in the campaign wholeheartedly, with the result that 591 towns and villages were worked, comprising a population of over one million inhabitants. Many of these people had never been contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses before, while many others could not find words to express their joy at meeting the Kingdom publishers again. This is well shown by one of the many experiences received at the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The village </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">curgs</span><span class="font5"> were greatly alarmed by the work in the unassigned territories; they incited the people to chase the witnesses out of town; they accused them of being paid by American capitalists, and then again of being Communist propagandists; another said that Jehovah's witnesses were an American product similar to chewing gum, because like chewing gum they use a lot of saliva. He advised the people to shut the door in their face and if they got in by surprise then perhaps another American product DDT might put them to flight. In one village the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cure</span><span class="font5"> tore a handful of pages from the Catholic Bible which a sister was using in the witness work. He refused to pay for the Bible; therefore legal action is being brought against him and some of his own neighbors will testify against him. In another village a sister was beaten by a fanatical woman who had been incited by the priest, and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Legal action was taken against the woman and she was condemned to pay a fine. In some instances the fearless publishers pushed the battle to the gate and went to the priest’s home with the people and showed him up publicly with a Catholic version of the Bible. As the priests were not able to defend themselves, they usually called on the local gendarmes, but all the gendarmes could do was to admit that the witnesses were within their rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the street work also the opposition of the false shepherds has been overcome, resulting in many a captive being led to freedom. In Antwerp an invalid sister does street work regularly in her wheel chair at a location near a store. The storekeeper tried to get rid of her. First he called the police, but the policeman said she was within her rights. Then he enlisted two priests, who tried to persuade the sister to leave her place, but to no avail; so the priests decided to push her wheel chair down the street. At this some taxi drivers from across the street who had been watching and listening to the whole proceedings quickly ran up and said that the woman was teaching the truth and that unless the priests wanted trouble they had better get a move on them. Needless to say, they scurried off. This matter also came to the ears of some captives, helping them to get free from the shackles of false religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in many other countries the house-to-house activity has grown a little weak in Belgium, so we have been stressing the importance of more preaching from door to door. Bible studies must also be increased, for this is where the people of good will are really instructed and helped to take their stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the ban on the transportation of our literature it is now necessary for the publishers to deliver personally all the subscriptions for the magazines, but they joyfully accept this added privilege, even saying that it is a good thing, because it affords them the opportunity of meeting the subscribers and giving them additional help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know of three brothers in Belgium who were publishing when Jehovah took his power and began to reign over earth by his King Christ Jesus. What joy it must bring to the hearts of these faithful servants of Jehovah after all these years to now be accompanied by more than 3,000 other praisers of the great King Eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To crown a most happy service year with overflowing joy and to begin the new with burning zeal came our district assemblies, the one for the Flemish brothers at Ghent August 29-31 and the other at Lidge September 5-7 for the Walloon brothers. At Ghent 1,422 persons came to hear the public talk, while 2,135 attended at Liege, making a total of 3,557, a very nice increase. And what a fine program of rich delicious spiritual food was provided!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of each assembly our love and joy were overflowing and one and all requested that our love and greetings be conveyed to Brother Knorr and our fellow slaves throughout the world. Now we look forward joyfully to another happy service year and the world assembly at New York, where some of our Belgian brothers plan to be.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the tiniest states in all Europe. It has a beautiful countryside, and it is a land of old churches and cathedrals. The beauty of the land should incite the inhabitants of the land to praise the Creator. But false religion has blinded their minds, and by far the majority of the people are complacent. There was no increase in the number of publishers in Luxembourg. In fact, the average number of publishers dropped from 100 to 96. But this has not disheartened the witnesses that are there, and they are pressing on to a new year of searching for the other sheep. There are good possibilities of increasing the number of publishers, because 165 persons attended their Memorial service. So it means work on their part to help these on to maturity. Luxembourg comes under the direction of the Belgian office at Brussels, and the branch servant makes this report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many publishers have fought hard to overcome the people’s general indifference toward the truth. The prospect of eternal life in happiness and peace does not even appeal to the average Luxembourger. They are divided into two classes on the matter: either they think the world is so bad that not even God would be able to do anything about it, or they say, “The world is just fine as it is, so we don’t need a new one.” But adherents of both views have this in common, that nobody really wants to live forever. Of course, this all stems from the prevalent disbelief in God, which the Catholic religion has so successfully brought upon the people in this land. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> article “Are You Choosing Life or Death?” came as a good help to furnish the brothers with arguments on this point, but when the publishers now prove to the people that every normal person wants to live, they retort: “Well, that’s true, but still I don’t want to live forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the unassigned territories during the summer months stimulated many publishers to greater efforts. Since very little territory outside the towns of the local companies had been worked since before the last war, the work in those places aroused curiosity, surprise, interest and, of course, indignation on the part of the clergy; and so they tried to stop the work by sending the police after us and accusing us of peddling. It seems, however, that this has all turned out to our good and may help the authorities to decide about the status of Jehovah’s witnesses as ministers. Here is a case that shows how the clergy work to keep the people from learning the truth. The missionaries and local pioneers visited some hamlets not far from a village where the gendarmery is located. Everything worked out fine. They placed many books both for voluntary contributions as well as giving them away to people desiring them but not contributing. After some weeks the missionaries were visited by the gendarmes at their home and were accused of having sold “Watchtower Bibles”. The missionaries decided to talk to the police in the village where this false accusation was made, so five pioneers went to the village; one missionary went directly to the police in order to clear up the charge, while the others went from door to door presenting the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World, Crisis</span><span class="font5"> ? free to everyone who would accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Attaining maturity and becoming a real preacher of the good news has been a problem for many of the Luxembourg brothers. Generally it requires a long time before new ones attend meetings and still longer before they start in the field service. Therefore one rejoices the more when someone grasps the truth almost at the first contact. A life insurance agent came to the missionary home while going about looking for people who want to buy insurance. By this visit this man learned for the first time about life assurance. He took some bound books and promised to return soon. After some weeks he returned an evening just when the missionaries were getting ready to leave for the service meeting. Since there was no time to talk to him he was invited to go along to the meeting. He seemed to enjoy the meeting very much and when it was over he asked if he might come next time also. He has been attending all meetings since then, is earnestly studying and has also begun in the field service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Bolivia had much joy in proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom during the past year. They were telling the prisoners to go forth, and many of them did. You will notice, in reading their report, that their average of 100 publishers was the highest they have ever had. Their average for the previous year was 68. The peak number of publishers was 114. Bolivia is a country of revolutions, but these do not disturb Jehovah’s witnesses. They just keep right on preaching. There is much isolated territory in Bolivia, due to the fact that there are not many publishers. But even this territory was worked by the few publishers in that country, and the branch servant tells us about some interesting experiences in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A good deal of work was done in isolated territory during the year, with very good results. On vacation two native brothers went to witness to residents and workers at a tin mine a few hours by truck from La Paz, neither one knowing the other was going. They were overjoyed and surprised to find each other after they started to work, and then they worked together. However, they placed all their literature that morning, which was much sooner than they had ever expected, and when they returned and related their experience they admonished all brothers to be sure to take cartons of literature along should they take a similar vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A missionary from Oruro and another from Cochabamba went for a trip into the jungles of Bolivia in the eastern parts and had the unique experience of having the police chief in a small village, after asking them what they were there for, offer to help distribute the literature. For the rest of the day the police station was the center of distribution of literature for the village and many who came from the local plantations and farms took something to read. One man took 30 magazines to distribute among his neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For two Sundays in a row company publishers and Gilead graduates from La Paz visited and worked the town of Viacha, some eight or ten miles out of La Paz. A large quantity of books was placed the first Sunday and arrangements were made to give a public talk in the local </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cine</span><span class="font5"> the following Sunday. When the talk was given the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cine</span><span class="font5"> was packed out with 120 persons, which was far beyond our expectations. A fine time was had by all and to the newly interested “sheep”, who went with us for the first time, this was a real treat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In August three missionary graduates of Gilead from La Paz took a vacation trip to the towns of Villazon, Tarija, Sucre and Potosi, taking something over 300 books and Bibles with them. The first day in Villazon in a short time the three placed nearly 100 books and they had the branch office send quantities more to Sucre and Potosi, for they knew that they would need them when they got there. They terminated a very pleasant vacation, placing around 850 books in the four places and turning in a large number of names of persons on which the branch office will follow through with letters and copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a real privilege to be able to help people of good will to come to know about Jehovah’s marvelous purposes, and then see them show their appreciation by active service. We are aware that there is much work to be done in Bolivia, and with it there are many, many blessings in store for those who devote themselves diligently to Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Brazil is going ahead by leaps and bounds. There was an increase of 23 per cent in the average number of publishers and a 7 per cent increase over their previous peak. The new peak of publishers in Brazil is 5,706, and our branch servant says, “While this is fair progress, we feel that there could have been a greater increase. How? By all taking fuller advantage during the year of the Society’s pointed Bible counsel to progress on to Christian maturity.” The branch sees where much greater strides could have been made in the company organizations and by zealous publishers’ taking a greater interest in helping the immature ones become more stable in their witness work. The branch servant and the publishers in Brazil are not discouraged, no, not by any means. They are moving ahead with Jehovah’s organization, worshiping their God in holy array. The prisoners are coming forth in great numbers, but when you stop to think of the vast territory and the millions of people that populate Brazil, you must agree that there is still much to be done. Now let us look at the branch servant’s report and read some of the very pleasant experiences that have taken place in that great country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant in Bahia, who was notified by the Society to visit Senhor John Baptist, reached the city of Lagedo Alto after traveling 17 hours. Behold, one of the city’s public political orators awaits him; a fellow who looked for the truth in exoticism, spiritism, Protestantism and Catholicism, even debating with a local pastor to hit upon some satisfactory truth. Failing, he thumbed through the library and found the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font5"> He talked it around until a lady loaned him the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font5"> He read it and declared he had found the truth; he wrote the Society, and now the circuit servant was before him to be of service. From then on the circuit servant wondered who was being encouraged the most. Senhor Baptist took hold of the door-to-door work very rapidly, learned the back-call work, helped organize private Bible studies, a group study in town, a public lecture, and even answered correctly most of the audience’s questions afte” the talk. At the next visit a baptism was promised of the twenty interested and a company organization soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Manaus a coaldealer delivering coal witnessed to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> person of good will and started a study. Soon it was made into a company study because of the large attendance. During the second company study a Catholic attender brought along his priest. When they entered, there were already 100 people seated. The priest interrupted the study with question after question, but got all mixed up with his own arguments as one by one they were nullified by the study conductor. His buddies that came in with him had to prompt him continually. Everybody could see that he had no Bible knowledge. Finally in desperation he began to call names and backed out. Those in attendance (almost all Catholics) commented on Jehovah’s witnesses’ faith and the arrogance on the part of the false religionists. The owner of the house got so enthused that he gave his loud-speaking equipment to the witnesses to give, as he declared, “lectures all over the city”! Even the priest’s gang recognized his complete failure to break up the study and to influence his former flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes between companies the circuit servants must travel far through the jungle on river boats. But they do not miss the opportunity to witness. As one of them writes en route to Belem on the Amazon river: “I got up early and prayed to Jehovah for the opportunity to give a good witness during the day. I took my book bag with me to breakfast and opened a book and began to read at the table. People around me began to look and one by one asked me what it was. One after another they received a witness and I placed books with them. After the meal I invited the interested ones up on deck, and 16 of us with our books began a study. The rest on the boat became curious, giving me an opening for a continual witness day after day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among those who claim to be leaders of religious instruction for the people are many who show themselves sincere. For instance, a radio manager was approached with a view to broadcasting a talk. He explained that he was a Sunday-school teacher and thus was interested to know more about this message. He accepted a booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People</span><span class="font5"> and on the second visit he exclaimed that in all his years as a Sunday-school teacher he had never received such a clear picture of God’s purpose to re-establish paradise conditions on earth. He immediately made arrangements for the broadcast free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s representative in Sao Paulo arranged for a Bible discourse with the personnel of a local station who were truth-seekers, and was offered a broadcast free of charge. Not only was the talk broadcast, but it was also relayed over a rediffusion system to 12 public points in town, and during the lecture groups of people gathered in each of these public places to listen. All told, there were more than 2,000 people counted listening to the talk apart from the even greater number that heard the broadcast in their own homes. In the hall from which the talk was broadcast, 33 persons expressed their desire to take part in this gospel proclamation. These open-air loudspeakers in the public squares of Brazilian cities are a boon to our public meeting campaign. From another city comes the biggest report to date, saying that the circuit servant just finished giving his Sunday public address to an estimated six thousand persons gathered in that manner. Certainly Jehovah’s witnesses are not going to miss such chances to talk to so many people at one time, congregating, as is their custom, in the downtown squares in the cool of the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah willing, we will continue working to free all the prisoners we can before the old world stops its building and its cities lie wasted. Please convey our love and greetings and determination to keep on standing firm for the new world to our brothers in other lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The people of British Guiana are not great travelers. They confine themselves, for the most part, to their home towns and plantations. But when one becomes one of Jehovah’s witnesses, it makes great changes in his life. Jehovah’s witnesses have a command from God through his Son, Christ Jesus, to go and make disciples of people of all nations. So as the unassigned territory work was being advocated as something to be accomplished during 1952, Jehovah’s witnesses in British Guiana began to move about as never before. The branch servant’s report in this regard is very interesting. Getting out into these fields evidently helped somewhat in gaining an increase. A new peak of 317 was reached in British Guiana although the average is only 2 per cent higher as far as publishers out in the field every month are concerned. They are going in the right direction, and they are a happy group. Here are some of the excerpts from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year, one-day assemblies were arranged for companies with territory too small for a circuit assembly. Nearby companies supported, local problems received attention in the circuit activity meeting, and cinema owners co-operated in providing facilities for the public to hear timely topics discussed. This greatly assisted local company organizations. Then came the unassigned territory campaign and a holiday week end was chosen to travel by steamer to Bartica. Advance organization had provided accommodations and cafeteria for the 75 visiting publishers. These were later divided into 15 groups and assigned to various islands, timber grants and quarries all within a few hours’ reach. Launch owners co-operated well with free transportation in every case and some managers advised in advance even gave food and lodging to the visitors, while others depended upon the apostolic method and lodged wherever invited. Some went several miles into the “bush”, with one party having to wade waist deep in water to push their boat over the rapids. Amerindians seeing the books for the first time eagerly took sets of five and would have taken more. In the evenings brothers gave talks in the open air while sisters conducted impromptu studies. One sister reports: “They expressed regret at our temporary visit, as they had learned so much in the short time. We showed the head of the family how to continue the study, and the mother was glad of a way to teach the children the Bible since their Sunday school taught so little.” One manager said: “You can have our church building and send in a missionary, for no one else uses it.” Nearly all in that compound were Catholic. All the publishers returned to Bartica for the one-day assembly there, and reports showed 360 books placed besides public talks and a few immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two missionaries spent their two weeks’ vacation among Amerindians of the Arawak tribe. These people live a primitive life scattered over the hills in the jungle near to the Venezuelan border. Their report said: &quot;... our presence soon became well known and people became very friendly, so that many books and Bibles were placed and many public talks given. At the school the nuns asked children whose parents had taken literature to raise their hands and they were then told to bring it to school. However, these ‘birds’ got little of the ‘seed’ here. Parents became indignant, and some plainly told the priest that they would choose for themselves what to read. Further, he inadvertently aroused their curiosity and gave a fine witness in his church when he held up the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?</span><span class="font5"> and said in derogation: ‘D’you know the booklet says that only 144,000 will go to heaven and that people like you and I are to live only upon earth?’ Surely no weapon formed against us will prosper! A few books were still on hand vvhen the day arrived to embark for home. Would the people turn up for their books as ordered? For an hour before departure at the riverside dozens of tiny boats were arriving for market; and sure enough, every book was taken and money given for more to be mailed. A simple people with implicit honesty! Surely some of this kind of men will also be saved!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These intensified activities have put the “false shepherds” on the run, and they have issued many warnings to their “prisoners” even in remote places; but this has merely sharpened the issue, enabling some of the “lost sheep” to better identify the “true religion”. A sister reports: “After identifying myself, the husband pushed me out of the house and scattered my books all over the road. While collecting them an onlooker espied the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </span><span class="font5">and asked to see it; a crowd gathered while I continued to explain its contents to everyone listening. Result: 13 books placed besides magazines, including one to the original opposer who had been listening and who was now full of apologies, saying: ‘Please come and tell my wife, myself and my children more about the Bible; the clergy said you were false christs and that we must not admit you.’ They are now having regular visits.” A pioneer brother writes that when calling at a remote riverside home he was confronted with a preacher, saying: “We had a conference last month in N. A. and discussed you people”; and to prove it he showed me the agenda listing Jehovah’s witnesses, Armageddon, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and personalities and added: “We were told not to allow you in our homes.” Skillful use of tact and scripture opened his eyes with results: a change of mind, books placed and maybe another prisoner loosed. Progress toward maturity has been noticed in many ways, not the least being the personal effort of so many to co-operate in unassigned territory. On some occasions over 90 publishers of neighboring companies have chartered an entire train coach or motor buses, with excellent results not only in the public testimony given but also in the gathering of ourselves together; and having the new ones with the more mature brothers has enabled all to better appreciate Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s slaves in British Honduras have pressed on during the year, singing the new song. This has been done by spending many more hours in the field than during any previous year. The hours have increased from 11,829 in 1951 to 15,125 in 1952. Still, in number the publishers have decreased. So we see from this that a greater witness has been given in talking the good news, but it does not seem to have had much effect on the people. There must be more of the other sheep in British Honduras, and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, Jehovah’s servants there are going to try to find them. While there were fine increases in number of publishers during 1951, they seemed to be unable to hold these increases during 1952. The branch servant feels that all there are much more mature than previously. These few excerpts from his report are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This drop in number of publishers, however, does not indicate that we are not finding new ones who delight to do Jehovah’s will. In this connection, there is one very encouraging point to observe: most of the new ones show a great deal more zeal for Jehovah than many who have for several years been active in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only one assembly was held during the service year, but we feel it has done something to help at least some of the publishers to see the need for ‘advancing to maturity’. This was rather a unique assembly too, since it was necessary to charter a boat to transport, not only these who attended, but all the necessary equipment, tables, benches, sound equipment, cafeteria equipment and supplies, including two pigs for meat, beds for many of the publishers, as well as literature, etc. But it worked! People are still talking about it. At this assembly we had our largest attendance, too, thus making it outstanding in still another way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So, while we have not increased in number, but rather shown a slight decrease, yet we have advanced toward maturity. We may observe this not only in a good increase in hours spent in field service in spite of the drop in number of publishers, but it is still more pronounced in the fact that we now have four general pioneers on the list and one vacation pioneer who desires to continue as a general pioneer if she is able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All indications are to the effect that we will be getting off to a good start for another service year. We will have an assembly to start it off. Then two new missionaries will be here soon, to work with the four local pioneers, and we have the prospects of possibly two more soon, others having become more mature •—all this with Jehovah’s spirit to back us up. We rejoice to have had a small part in the mighty shout of praise that has ascended to Jehovah during the past service year. We sincerely trust that all the brothers, the mature ones and the immature as well, will continue to “go on growing in the undeserved kindness” and saying to the prisoners yet sitting in darkness, “Show yourselves.&quot;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The same problem exists in Britain that exists in other parts of the world, that is, finding the other sheep and bringing them on to maturity. Some seed falls on good ground and these publishers work diligently thereafter in the service of the Most High. Others work only for a while until the heat of the day comes on with the persecution from the Devil’s organization, and they slow down and disappear. So in Britain, during the past year, 2,850 persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God by water baptism, but there was not an increase of that size in number of publishers regularly engaging in the field service during the year. While the British branch reports an increase of 7.7 per cent on the average, bringing their regular publishers to 24,847 every month, still there are many in Britain associated with Jehovah’s people who are not engaging in house-to-house work every month. There are wonderful prospects for those who are interested. Thirty thousand one hundred eighty-one persons celebrated the Memorial of our Lord Jesus’ death, and all of these need attention. Our British brothers are anxious to aid those other sheep in every manner that they can and we know that the best way of aiding them is by going from house to house and conducting Bible studies. As do Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world, our fellow workers in Britain worship Jehovah in holy array. The branch servant’s report is very interesting, and the following excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is gratifying to see so many young folks joining the ranks of the praisers of Jehovah’s name. Indeed, it is a constant complaint of the false shepherds that Jehovah’s witnesses attract so many of the young people, and these are zealous too. One ardent Church of England person writing to the press says: “That word ‘zealous’—Jehovah’s witnesses certainly have that characteristic—so woefully weak in the older churches of today.” Another says: “Certainly we must admire—if not be a good bit jealous of the zeal that they can create among their workers and converts.” The concern of the clergy is to know how to combat the growing activity of Jehovah’s witnesses; and recently, when a circuit assembly was due in Devon, the local church leaders issued a united warning in the form of a leaflet entitled; “Tivertonians, You Are to Be Invaded.” One of the clergymen stood out against this united move. His reason: &quot;The threat of countermeasures serves only to give the witnesses publicity which they would not otherwise receive.” And this is exactly what happened! The district servant reported: “It has been one of the most thrilling assemblies I have ever attended; from the start, the interest and opposition of the local clergy in Tiverton sharpened the enthusiasm of the brothers to a razor-edge keenness. A splendid witness has resulted, for we had a packed hall.” So it is with the circuit assemblies generally, for they are stirring up the towns and villages around the country and the false shepherds are crying out warnings in all directions to their flocks. The assemblies are proving a great stimulus to the Kingdom publishers too. The program of practical demonstrations on more efficient service has been very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rural campaign has been much enjoyed by all, and although most of our territory is compact we have covered every part of the British field and thrilling experiences were had with the country people. Two pioneers working the Scilly Isles, off the tip of Cornwall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—total population, 1,900—placed 200 books and 280 booklets during their visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One publisher writes: “While working the rurals the only place available for the public talk was the vestry of the chapel. This was offered to us by the minister, who said we could have the use of it after their usual service. Imagine our surprise when in walked the minister accompanied by more than thirty of his congregation, who stayed for the whole talk. Afterward he thanked us for the message and said he would be pleased to have us again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been our privilege to have some part in contending for the right of our brothers in Malaya. After repeated efforts to get some satisfaction from the Colonial Office a sympathetic member of Parliament raised a question in the House as to the reason for the ban on the missionaries of the Watch Tower Society in Malaya. This brought a reply from the colonial secretary which follows the usual pattern. Another member rose and said that the Society’s activities took a very different form in the Colonies and were responsible for the unscrupulous exploitation of the native peoples in many parts of the world. This unwarranted attack brought an avalanche of letters from all the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses in the land. Every member of Parliament received a letter and the member who made the attack has by now good reason to doubt, the wisdom of his statement. There are, of course, divided opinions but it has been enlightening to see that a number have expressed sympathy with us after reading the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article and the letters. One member wrote: “It is interesting to note that the colonial secretary’s reply was almost identical to the accusations made against the disciples in the Acts: ‘These people have turned the world upside down.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is very evident that those who stay close to Jehovah’s organization and keep busy in the Kingdom service are rejoicing in the increasing light as never before, while others who follow their own ideas lose what light they had and all the precious privileges of the ministry. The brothers in Britain are united and will continue to sing Jehovah’s praises while they keep busy feeding the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The international convention in New York is now in prospect and already preparations are under way for many to cross the Atlantic again. We know that Jehovah has much in store for his people, and we anticipate that many hundreds will be making their way to New York to share in the feast that will be provided. We assure you of our continued prayers for Jehovah’s blessing on all your efforts as you make preparations for that great event. As to the future, we have our hands full of Kingdom service and our minds fortified with the truth, for which we are thankful. We in Britain assure you of our love and unity with our brothers in all the earth as we give all praise to Jehovah for all his undeserved kindness to us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>EIRE (IRELAND)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Everyone knows that the Catholic religion has exercised a strong influence over the lives of the people of Eire. It hangs like a pall over the whole country, and as is true in so many Catholic-controlled territories, there are found much ignorance and poverty among the people in general. The country is full of religious buildings and idols of one kind or another. The Society has done much in trying to bring truth and light to these people by the study of the Bible. At the present time there are 18 graduates from the school of Gilead who have gone into that country as missionaries. There has been some increase in the work during the past year. There was an average of 116 publishers in the field, which is an 8.4 per cent increase over the previous year, and they reached a peak in publishers of 126. With very diligent and hard work, there are possibilities of more of the Irish people’s taking their stand, but it is going to be a slow process. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, his slaves throughout the earth will continue preaching the good news and helping those who are willing to break away from the traditions that have bound them. Eire comes under the British branch office, and the branch servant gives us some interesting facts about the work in Eire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irishman is notoriously kind and hospitable but also very suspicious of anything that is not from the “church . This attitude was well expressed by Paddy who said, when approached by the Kingdom publisher, “And phwat do you suppose the loikes of youse want to come over here praechin’ to the loikes of us? Sure, isn’t this the land of saints and scholars?” It is very difficult for people in progressive countries to understand the Irish Catholic mind with its satisfaction with things as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the country districts one can be quietly witnessing and getting along fine when suddenly, without any warning, but due to some word innocently uttered that has caused doubts as to your religion, you are liable to be unceremoniously chased off the premises. It is then wise to beat a hasty retreat. If religious bigotry and hatreds were eliminated, it would be pleasurable to talk to these simple-living countryfolk who seldom see strangers and who are kind-hearted and easygoing. Apart from feeding their stock, they worry little about what is left undone today, for there is always tomorrow; and so we must adapt ourselves, for a hurried city brusqueness would repel them. A frequent remark of the householder when the publisher leaves is: “Well, good-by now and all kind of luck to yez.” A woman who did not appreciate the message said: “Och man dear, will ya go away or you’ll have me do a murther on me own doorstep.” Recently an effort has been made to reach out to the more isolated districts, but it entails hard work and much cycling over rough ground to the scattered farms. When the people can be reached before the priest has issued his warning, there is a hearing awaiting the publisher; but if the warning of evil literature is given, the people will not listen and the journey is in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It takes longer for these “sheep” to break away from the strong traditions that have held them all their lives, but with tact and kindly dealing there are many taking a firm stand for the Kingdom. It takes the courage of one’s convictions to become a publisher of the Kingdom in Eire, for measures are put into operation by Catholic “friends” to make it very difficult for one who has been a Catholic to come out into the open and engage in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the streets of Dublin the publishers are to be seen every week offering the magazines to the public, and this is a witness which is appreciated by many. Not many will come forward and say so on the streets, but when the publishers call at their homes they are told. In Cork is another missionary home, and so this second city in Eire is getting a thorough witness. But here again the interested ones are timid because they are threatened with dismissal from their place of employment if they accept the truth, and in Eire it is not easy to get a job. It needs the power of Jehovah’s spirit to break the fetters of religion that holds down these poor souls, and we are glad to know that the day is here when this will take place.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are 13 islands where publishers are located in the British West Indies. All of these report to the branch office located in Port of Spain, Trinidad. Sometimes it is difficult to go from island to island; but the brothers get around. We find a good increase on almost all the islands. However, due to improper living on the part of some who claim to be Jehovah’s people, there has been a decrease on some islands. The brothers are very grateful to the Society for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">article on keeping the organization clean. There were some thirty-five cases of disfellowshiping that were reported to the Trinidad office; and this, of course, had an effect on some of the companies in reducing the number of publishers. The branch servant says, however, that this cleaning process has done the whole organization much good, and everyone appreciates that those who are going to serve as Jehovah’s witnesses must live according to the standard that God has set forth in his Word. The organization throughout the whole territory has gained in maturity, and the publishers see their responsibility; so during 1953 good progress should be made. The British West Indies as a whole have just held their own as far as number of publishers is concerned. The isolated territory campaign offered quite a problem to the brothers there, but they did get out into territory that had not been worked sufficiently. We read about this in the excerpts from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Results far beyond our expectations were obtained in the isolated territory work. Because most of our isolated territory was on the other islands and it is costly and difficult traveling between them, it was felt that very little could be accomplished. However, plans were made in full faith and all companies were invited to share by covering the isolated territory right in their own assignments. What open territory there was available was quickly taken up. Enthusiasm among groups ran high as they started in to work their assignments. Names of good-will persons came in slowly at first but speeded up during the latter half of the campaign. By the end of August over 1,000 letters had been mailed out from the branch office! Many have written back to express appreciation and delight at receiving them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In holding public lectures in connection with the unassigned territory work, arrangements were made by a group to use a Friendly Society hall. The one in charge of opening the hall on the night in question refused to do so on the ground that no authorization had been given her. The group reports, “We kept an open-air study that night and Jehovah’s blessing was with us, for although we had no seats we had a bigger attendance than usual. At the end of the study I told the audience that Jehovah’s witnesses were their friends and had come to the parish to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Public meetings continue to play a big part in spreading the good news of the Kingdom into all parts of our territories. With the emphasis on isolated territory this year we have reached out into the rurals and the countryfolk prove to be good listeners like their city cousins. As you start a talk only five or ten may show up, but before the end the crowd will have increased to over 100. One company reports that after advertising all day and upon arrival at the lecture point in front of a small shop no one came. “After waiting some time we were just about ready to give up and go home when two men stepped out of a shop. Seeing them I prepared to talk to them. Before I could start one of them said, ‘You can’t give that talk; nobody is here to listen to you. Wait five minutes and we’ll get some people to come’. With that they walked down the road calling to each householder and different ones they met on the road, ‘Come and listen to the white man talk about the Bible.’ People came from everywhere. In less than ten minutes 40 people had gathered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through the efforts of the missionaries on the Society’s boat “Sibia” and the circuit servant, we have opened up the work on another island that till recently was isolated. Much work has been done by these missionaries during the past two years on the islands, but their stay on any one has been much too short to organize anything more than a study. However, many of the interested humble folk of this island made a special effort to attend a circuit assembly in Grenada, a neighboring island some 35 miles distant, and they became very enthusiastic. Upon their return the circuit servant and his wife paid a visit to the group along with the crew of the “Sibia” and two visiting missionaries on holiday from Trinidad, and a very profitable week was enjoyed. The circuit servant gave four talks, with a total attendance of 410, and ten local persons engaged in advertising the talks. This is remarkable when it is recalled that the population of the island is only less than 9,000, and Trinidad is only seven miles long by two miles wide. The missionaries report the following reaction to such activity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The effect of the circuit servant’s visit as well as the Trinidad missionaries has been felt in all places they visited. Many are the expressions of appreciation, particularly with reference to the kindness and complete lack of segregation Jehovah’s witnesses show to the people. There is one man who is violently angry at us—the Anglican priest. At one service he read out the names of those associating with us and said he would not give them communion again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries and publishers again join with me in sending their love and greetings to you and ask that you convey them on to all the brothers everywhere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There is not much that the Society can report as to what has been accomplished in the way of witnessing in Bulgaria, but we have received information from our brothers there that they are very grateful for the spiritual food that comes through to them. One brother writes, “I am your unknown brother, unknown physically, but known to you through our common faith and hope in Jehovah, our God, and his Son, Christ. Jesus. I lifted up my eyes to our heavenly Father to thank him for being able to keep in touch with you so that we have been able to receive knowledge. What we need is the spiritual food.” Sometimes one would think that in a country where great oppression exists and where freedom of speech has been taken away, people would lapse right back into the power of the state and think only of the material things because they despair of getting any help from the spiritual things. But this is not so with our faithful brothers in Bulgaria. They know they need the things of the spirit and the knowledge of Jehovah God and of his Son, Jesus Christ, for this means everlasting life to them. We wish we could do more for them, but will continue to try to send to them the things that will bring them joy of heart and strengthen their minds to press on in the service of the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a healthy increase in the number of publishers in Burma, with 109 regularly reporting field service, and they reached a 'new peak of 130 Kingdom singers. This good gain in publishers was not made without earnest effort on their part, nor without working under very difficult conditions. Burma has not settled down yet as a united nation. There are much unrest, disease, suffering and sorrow in the country. But in spite of all of this there is a steady pushing forward of the Kingdom message. The branch servant writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The country of Burma contains people of many nationalities. In checking over our list of publishers we run into some very interesting facts. Our new publishers are coming from the Anglo-Indian people who live in Burma, but there are a few Europeans and Anglo-Burmese that comprise the entire organization. When you understand that Burma, as far as religion is concerned, is practically solidly Buddhist, you can see that it is really difficult to interest people in the truth. But among the Karens, there are hundreds of thousands of persons who believe in Christ Jesus. Among these there are good possibilities of finding other sheep. There are approximately 2,000,000 Karens in Burma; and they are a distinct, separate group because of their religious belief. Because these are Christians and do not carry on the Buddhist belief, they are not well liked by the Burmese people, so they have some difficulty in preaching the good news. Then again, when Jehovah’s witnesses go in among the Karens to preach to them, the opposition comes from the clergy, because they do not want their people to hear about God’s kingdom. Often, the expression is made by the religious leaders: “Why don’t you people go to the heathens and leave us Christians alone?” But still the pastors of these flocks do not want them to get any more knowledge of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting, too, to note that a number of persons who are associated with the army have a hearing ear for the truth, and because the army is moved about in many parts of Burma the truth is spread in this manner. They are interested in our publications, and the soldiers often talk about them wherever they go. The pioneers in Burma are the ones who are doing the greatest amount of work. There are eleven, six working as special publishers and five as general pioneers. These eleven publishers have devoted nearly 15,000 hours to preaching the good news, to compare with the 9,500 hours devoted to service by the company publishers. There is a great field here in Burma for pioneers, and it is hoped that many more will enter the full-time service. One of the great problems in Burma is that of trying to get part-time work. Recently, a sister who is employed in an office as a stenographer arranged her affairs with her parents, the people with whom she lived, and her employer. Finally, after great effort on her part and the making of many adjustments on the part of her family and her employer, she was able to get part-time work and do pioneer work at the same time. This was a great joy to her. She began pioneering in May, and she says that she has not regretted a single day. It does mean harder work for her in order to keep employed as a stenographer part-time, be a pioneer and still take care of her work at home. Her opportunity to bring honor and praise to the Almighty in Burma brings real happiness to our hearts, and she is happy in giving. This was all due to her reading the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> article, “Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good.” It made her make up her mind to try the pioneer work. She is happy now that she took the forward step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should like to say that we are not quite satisfied with our back-call work in general, especially in the Burmese section. In spite of all our efforts to push this grand work along among the Burmese people, it is quite common to hear pioneers say, &quot;I placed quite a few books in that section, but there is no use going back. They are all Buddhists.” There seems to be a deep-rooted prejudice among some of the publishers in Burma about calling back on Burmese people. But this is something that will have to be overcome in Burma as well as by all persons representing Jehovah God throughout the world. Back-call work is essential, and we here in Burma know it. Every effort will be put forward in 1953 to follow up placements of literature, even among the Burmese.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A good increase was realized in Canada again. While it was not so high as in other years, still there was an 8.9 per cent increase on the average. We now have 20,338 publishers engaging in the field service every month, to compare with 18,669 the year before. There are yet wonderful opportunities in Canada for gathering the other sheep, because 31,573 persons attended the Memorial and 1,624 were baptized during the year. Things in Canada are moving along very nicely, and the other sheep are being gathered in all provinces, including Quebec, where there is much trouble. This trouble will not subside as long as the religious organization controlling that province is against freedom of speech and against allowing people to do their own thinking. But despite this violent opposition on the part of the clergy in Quebec, the work moves along grandly. Those who are serving the interests of the Kingdom have joy in giving the truth to others. Another feature of service in which the publishers in Canada have joyfully engaged is the big job of working the unassigned territory. The branch servant sends in an interesting report and parts of it are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our records show that over 80 per cent of the available territory was assigned, excluding the province of Que-bee, and the major part of this territory has been completed. Much interest has been encountered and up to date we have received more than 16,000 names of interested persons and more are to follow. One group working on the British Columbian coast commenced work at 10 a.m., advertised a lecture for 2 p.m., and were delightfully surprised to see an attendance of 178. Another group that traveled 120 miles into the north country from their home in Alberta, taking tents and camping equipment, met a family of five who knew something about the Kingdom and who readily accepted the invitation to go out with them in the service. Another small party told of the difficulties experienced in working by boat along the coast line. Frequently they had to seek the shelter of coves and inlets lest the heavy seas should shiver their small boat to pieces. Whirlpools sometimes as much as 40 feet across were a constant danger; nevertheless they kept at the job of preaching and gave real comfort to many of these isolated ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Letters of appreciation have been received from goodwill persons voicing their gladness and telling of the benefit gained from the good-will letters and magazines mailed to them by the Society. One said ‘how glad he was to receive our letters, and that he would now like some instruction on how to publish the good news’. Another writes: “Your letters have spurred us to action and we now want to sell our farm and move to some place where we can actively associate with the witnesses.” Another wrote the following: “Having received three very informative and enlightening letters, I wish to announce that since I have received the truth I am a changed individual. I feel that life is really worth living, and will be more so in the new world. It makes me happy to think that the new world shall never fall apart or be brought to ruin, but shall stand forever as Jehovah has purposed. I am now receiving </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and have subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">Please send me the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The combined effort of the missionaries, special and general pioneers, and of the now more than 1,200 company publishers in the province of Quebec has effected an increase of over 17 per cent in number of publishers, the highest for any province this year. Sixty-seven missionaries, 19 special pioneers and 114 general pioneers have courageously ministered in Quebec. Four new companies have been organized, three new towns have been opened up as a missionary assignment, and the ready participation of these full-time ministers in the unassigned territory campaign has surely resulted in much deeper penetration of Quebec province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposition from the Quebec Catholic Hierarchy has continued unabated. Hatred has been manifested in many ways, and in practically every form of opposition the priests have been the instigators. They have organized mobs, incited violence, and stooped to the lowest forms of intolerance, all because the truth is exposing their lies and “bad fruit”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much time, effort and expense have been directed toward &quot;defending and legally establishing the good news” in the province of Quebec, and it has become our duty to take proceedings against the police, priests and others who have resorted to violence, lawbreaking, mobbings and even shootings. At Joliette action was taken against a newspaper that had maliciously lied against two missionary sisters. The editor turned out to be a priest, and in open court he was smoked out and confronted with the misstatements he could not prove. At Vai d’Or a priest was prosecuted for threatening violence and even death to some missionaries, whose only offense was trying to open the Bible to his parishioners. The circumstances served to show him up in his true colors. We await decision in this case. At Victoriaville a priest openly threatened persecution. Two missionary sisters were warned of a mob of 800 men organizing to kidnap them, and then children and young men began daily mob attacks. The police were appealed to, but without result, nevertheless the two sisters are still working the town, and in many quarters meeting with more respect than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During late autumn we are expecting one of the most important cases to be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada, involving the right to distribute literature in the towns and villages of Quebec without first submitting to police censorship. It is a representative case, for there are more than 800 similar cases still pending before the lower courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arrangements are now under way for organizing and helping in every way possible the many thousands of Canadian publishers who are planning to be at the World Assembly of 1953. Thousands will attend from the province of Ontario alone and we know that thousands more will travel to New York from the far East and West, distances up to 3,500 miles. As was done in 1950, every effort will be put forth, all kinds of sacrifices will be made, to make sure that all are present for the greatest convention of Christians yet.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Chile are happy to report Jehovah’s rich blessing on their efforts and their onward march toward maturity. We find a 20 per cent increase in number of publishers in Chile, where they have reached a new peak of 831 publishers; which certainly must make glad the hearts of all those who have taken up the ministerial work in that country for many years. Through their patience they now see that there were in the land many of the other sheep to be gathered. With the aid of the missionaries who have gone there and by their own faithfulness, the brothers in Chile have seen many true worshipers coming forth in holy array. There are a number of very interesting points that the branch servant brings out in his report which all will find interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Really last year’s peak of 765 publishers was a high mark to strive for in view of the concern to maintain the high Christian moral standard of the organization. This seemed to be the main problem when your special representative, Brother Donald Baxter, visited us in February this year. The consideration given to the subject together with the correspondence with your office served to bring out the proper understanding of a Christian’s position regarding morals. Thus the company organizations were enabled to properly carry on their activities of Jehovah’s clean worship and at the same time not unnecessarily eliminate some from service privileges and association with the organization. That this was “sowing with a view to the spirit” is quite evident in view of the new peak of 831 publishers for the last month of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the two circuit servants had an unusual experience in a northern town. Permission was obtained to use the town’s public-address system, over which music, daily news, etc., are brought to all inhabitants by a hookup of seven loud-speakers to cover the entire town. This time, however, the Kingdom message sounded out for one hour as the circuit servant gave his public talk to possibly 4,000 persons. It worked very well. Six months later he was able to use It again; the family of publishers there, being well known, helped make this possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant in the south reported good interest shown while visiting isolated persons. In one town a very interesting and profitable week was spent which ended with a public meeting Sunday afternoon. There were 27 present for the public talk, most of whom stayed for the animated </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study afterward. All showed a good spirit and requested the circuit servant to try to arrange another public meeting later in the same month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year’s text, “Say to the prisoners, Go forth,&quot; gave a fitting background for the following experience of the brothers in a southern city. They obtained permission to give a talk in the local prison. The warden had the 300 prisoners called from work to hear the talk, “The Earth in God's Purpose.” Later another talk was given on another occasion and 200 voluntarily attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While carrying the good news to others every faithful witness feels the need of refreshing his mind so as to present the Scriptures more clearly. The new program for Scripture reading certainly provides a wonderful opportunity to become familiar with every word of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Although the circulation of the Bible is increasing considerably in Chile, there are very few who have taken time to give it a careful study. The Society has therefore opened a very beneficial study for all who appreciate Jehovah’s provision of his Word. All those who attend the theocratic ministry school are learning many new things which they had overlooked before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you sometimes hesitate to present the campaign offer? During the three-book campaign a missionary was showing a new publisher how to present the books. When the new publisher decided to take a house alone the missionary gave her just one of her remaining four books. The new publisher returned asking for two more books; she made the three-book offer using one book and placed the set, so she needed two more to complete the set placed in her verbal testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the announcement of the 1953 international assembly, the brothers in Chile quickly caught up the spirit. The oldest company in Chile, now one of the five units in Santiago, decided that they would like to be represented; so they set up a box for contributions to help their unit servant make the trip. This can be appreciated much more when one learns that the brother is a full-time servant, cares for a unit of 123 publishers and is the brother who started to organize the work here in Chile a little more than twenty years ago.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A strong power rules China today, but it is good to be able to report that the faithful witnesses of Jehovah are still at their task of preaching the good news of the Kingdom. There are still three graduates of the eighth class of Gilead in Shanghai, China, and they are faithfully directing the work and aiding their Chinese brothers in every way they possibly can. There has been no increase in the number of publishers during the year. Some have moved away, some have fallen by the wayside, but those who have remained are far more mature in the truth than before and are anxious to continue in the preaching of the good news. Everything in China is supposed to line up with the state. The three missionaries were called before the police and told that they had to cease their house-to-house activity, but they were granted permission to conduct Bible studies and to lead the Kingdom Hall meetings. Today we find a bold little band of loyal Kingdom proclaimers studying </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> preaching the message of the Kingdom, and doing everything they can in China to gather together the other sheep. The servant in charge of the work there sends in a most interesting report, and excerpts from it are published herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Translation work is now well under way and it was a great joy to us all to get the Chinese translation of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> completed. It was out of the question to print it in Shanghai, so faithful, willing hands stenciled out by hand each chapter of the translation and it was run off on a mimeograph and each chapter made into a little booklet. Now, with such instruments in their hands, plus a full appreciation of the need for Bible studies on the part of all lovers of righteousness, the publishers went out to get them, and it was very thrilling to watch the number of studies rise through the year, 8,10,15. Then we hit the company quota of one study per publisher for the first time, and, to cap it all, the 22 publishers active in August 1952 reported 27 home Bible studies conducted. All these studies were conducted by Chinese brothers who themselves were only having their first studies a short time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the congregational meetings we have put all emphasis on getting as much of the programs in Chinese as possible. We began training the most suitable brothers to take part, and during the latter part of this service year we had the great joy of watching our first all-Chinese study get started. Conducted by a young Chinese brother, it went with a swing as all present joined in with lively comments to support it. we run two such studies a week now, featuring the newly translated chapters of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are now able to run a regular weekly service meeting in Chinese in which we have featured translated material from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font5"> booklet to help them combat the new religion of the city, and also we have Chinese brothers give short service talks and demonstrations in Chinese. These are most lively now as the Chinese brothers get the idea, and the attendance keeps up well</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the thrills of the year was our water baptism, held in a private garden with its own swim pool, kindly lent to us for the occasion. It had been a rainy month, but this 13th day of July dawned in brilliant sunshine which continued all day. Fifty-five persons gathered for the open-air address, which was followed by the immersion of eight brothers and nine sisters, all Chinese. The Memorial was held in the Kingdom Hall this year and 84 packed it out for the occasion, overflowing into an adjacent room at the rear. Indeed we all felt very blessed. How grateful to our loving heavenly Father we all were!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An experience or so may serve to bring out the unshakable faithfulness of the brothers. There is the case of a brother working in a cotton mill who was ‘put on trial’ by the labor union on account of his Christian stand. He had refused to contribute for tanks, airplanes and guns, nor would he work overtime if the extra wages earned were to be donated to such ends. He had openly declared that he was not interested in the political affairs of any country and would not take part in them. When it was learned that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the officials asked for copies of the literature he was studying. He supplied them with all he had in the Chinese language. They were later passed back to him and he heard nothing further about the matter. However, his boldness aroused the admiration of others and Jehovah gave His blessing, for, due to this brother’s fine stand, four more persons of his acquaintance have commenced studying with him, two of whom are already witnessing. The brother still presses on with joy in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Chinese sister became interested in the truth and was soon spreading it among her friends. She became a valuable aid in assisting with the translation work and, having received her copies of the translated </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> chapters, was determined to get busy with them herself. Strongly opposed by her husband, she toured her relatives and friends and began a study with her husband’s brother. He readily accepted the truth and was baptized. He enrolled in the ministry course and became a regular house-to-house publisher and now conducts three Bible studies of his own, while his sister-in-law, now a sister in a much higher relationship, conducts six Bible studies as the year closes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, there is much evidence of Jehovah’s rich blessing on his “sheep” living in this “Assyrian”-dominated land and it is a joy to assist them to the one fold and watch their zeal in taking up the work amidst great opposition. During the year the maturity level of the brothers has risen sharply. They now face the situation with full confidence in Jehovah’s backing and are determined not to lose the most wonderful treasure they possess, that of being a Kingdom announcer and having a share in the vindication of Jehovah’s great name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As the year’s text said, “Say to the prisoners, Go forth,” and our brothers in Colombia are doing just that. The country of Colombia is going through hard times. There are many unemployed, food prices are soaring and there are frequent political disturbances. There are suppression of personal liberty and especially persecution of Protestants. This, of course, is due to the fact that the Catholics have gained strong control of the government. But despite these conditions, Jehovah’s witnesses are pressing on in their work of saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.” Their report is most encouraging, because this year they had an average of 281 workers out in the field every month, to compare with 218 the previous year, or a 29 per cent increase. Their peak in publishers has moved right on up to 338, so they have excellent prospects for next year in increasing their general average. The branch servant gives us some very interesting facts about the country and what has happened during the past twelve months which the readers will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gladly we announce that during the year, in spite of conditions here, Jehovah has given the increase. Two new companies were formed, 114 new witnesses were baptized; and a good general increase is seen in service activities, including an increase of 29 per cent in average number of publishers. Zeal of the local publishers is revealed by the following experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother, anxious to have a part in unassigned territory work, took passage on a river boat to visit a heretofore untouched </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font5"> along the famous Magdalena river. Arriving at this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font5"> of 12,000 inhabitants, the brother joyfully preached from early morning to late afternoon with excellent reception. Suddenly a man carrying a large case approached him, asking if he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Receiving the affirmative he proudly opened his bag and displayed two of our publications well-soiled from much use. He declared: “I have read these books several times and I know that this is the truth. Therefore as I travel from town to town I have been displaying these books to the people and announcing to them that Jehovah’s witnesses will soon be around to visit them, as this is the time of the end and such was foretold. I’m telling the people that they should receive you well and buy your books.” He proceeded to give a fine testimony to those gathered about. Then he invited the brother to a rooming house, there to eat, talk and study until after midnight. The following day this interested man obtained a good supply of literature to distribute and faithfully went his way, hoping, of course, to see this witness again some day. The witness then returned to Barranquilla feeling happy and well repaid for his trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The company servant of Bogota, the capital city, writes this: Several months of consistent study in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> convinced a middle-aged couple that this is the truth. Although the economic situation forced them to move to a village sixty miles from Bogota, they did not want to leave until we assured them that someone would be sent to visit them and baptize them. A month later we chartered a new Ford bus and at 6 a.m. one Sunday morning we left for the three-and-a-half-hour trip down the mountain from cool Bogota to tropical Tocaima. Upon arrival we found a large room filled with chairs and benches. It seems that the couple had not been idle. Among the interested persons contacted was a carpenter who loaned long planks for the benches. Sixty-one listened to the circuit servant’s baptismal discourse and then observed the immersion of nine new brothers in the swift river a few miles out from the village. Post-baptism activity included a picnic lunch on the rocks by the river and then two hours of door-to-door preaching in the village with the newly baptized ministers in the forefront. Since then our brothers have moved again, this time to a city 200 miles farther from Bogota. A letter just received tells us that the interested carpenter needs literature to work with and that they, in the new territory, hope to contact the nearby pioneer sister and to start a small company. It brings joy to our hearts to see those that realize their responsibilities and then do something about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Colombian brothers want the whole world to know that they are not dismayed by local conditions. To the contrary, they, too, are real optimists as they go forward in the fight for freedom and maturity. We intend to continue to work hard along with our brothers during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A great multitude of one-time prisoners to Satan’s organization are now enjoying the freedom that comes through Jehovah’s organization. It certainly makes glad the hearts of all Jehovah’s servants throughout the world to see the constant increase of the work in Costa Rica, a small country in Central America. There were 1,583 publishers regularly engaging in field service, a 14 per cent increase over the previous year. Additionally, they had a new peak in publishers of 1,720. There are a number of different experiences reported by the branch servant that will be of real interest to the readers of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font6"> These show that clean worship is a necessary thing in the organization. They prove that it is necessary to continue to meet together with Jehovah’s people and keep on taking in knowledge. This is the ninth annual report for the Costa Rican branch, and all of us are happy with the brothers in their giving of the truth to the people of that nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As more and more knowledge fills the mind we understand what it means to be Jehovah’s witnesses and live up to the name. Many times it means changing and arranging our personal lives in accord with God’s requirements. At one of the circuit assemblies in February the district servant learned that two of the attendants, who had been studying with the brothers for some time, were going to take advantage of their trip to the seat of the province to be married. They had been anxious to arrange their affairs for a long time so as to become witnesses and had made arrangements for legalizing their marriage at the governor’s home on the Saturday afternoon of the assembly. However, for the benefit of the other brothers arrangements were quickly made to have the ceremony at the assembly hall. After the afternoon program, at the appointed time, the governor arrived with his secretary and the entire assembly was able to witness the marriage. It was a joyful occasion, as well as an example and admonition to others who had not as yet taken this theocratic step. It was especially effective when it was made known that this couple were in the twilight of life, both in their sixties, having lived together unmarried for over thirty years. What greater testimony could there be to the name of Jehovah and to the work that his witnesses are carrying out in helping the people to become real Christians than for this elderly couple to have their grandchildren present, as servants of Jehovah, witnessing their marriage! These brothers may be advanced in years and suffer physical defects, but their obedient actions show that they have emerged from the “prison house” of old-world darkness and are anxious for others to see their “right works”.—1 Pet. 2:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Memorial celebration this year was a joyous time and was attended by 2,357 persons, 193 more than last year. One of the circuit servants wrote in about the Memorial celebration in the small company he was visiting at the time, called Pital de San Carlos, made up of about 25 publishers. The Kingdom Hall there is small and, hoping to fill it, the brothers worked hard and zealously to advertise the meeting. Just after 6 p.m. rain began to fall, which usually means that few will attend, especially in mountainous places where travel is difficult. But, in spite of the rain, the brothers and people of good will began to arrive, some having walked from eight to ten hours to get there, others arriving on horseback and still others coming in small boats on the river. When the meeting began the small hall was packed and many were standing outside in the rain, and when the final count was taken it was learned that 133 persons had heard the discourse and had witnessed the passing of the emblems, not one participating, showing that all understood that they were of Jesus’ other sheep. A schoolteacher, who had at one time been the principal of the school and had prohibited the children from attending the meetings, had been invited by some of the brothers and accepted. After the meeting she admitted frankly that Jehovah’s witnesses were teaching the truth, and she is now studying with them. No matter how isolated the place or how sparsely settled, freedom seekers are coming forth and showing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was shown in the experience of another circuit servant who was working with a local pioneer in Puerto Cortez. An effort was being made to organize a small company and they were searching for good-will people that were willing to publish. They worked four days, placing literature and starting studies. Then on the fifth day, while working one of the farms, they were directed to the house of a young man who, the neighbors said, was one of Jehovah's witnesses. After meeting him it was learned that this young man and a group of five others, all single men, had been meeting once a week to have a Bible study, in which they would read and discuss various publications of the Society with their Bibles. Every Sunday before studying they would go from house to house and invite all the neighbors to study with them. They said that they had no one to show them how the work was done, so they did the best they could and prayed that Jehovah would send a more capable servant to help them. A company was soon established there and these “sheep” are now working in an organized manner freeing others from bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that in the lonely mountain regions the best field experiences are to be had. The truth reached one of these isolated sections called La Maravilla de Nicoya in a very interesting way. A publisher from another part of the country went there to visit his brother in the flesh and related how he had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The man, still a Catholic, became furious and they began to argue. The argument started at the supper table and continued until just before sunup, but both men ended up in agreement Both were now Jehovah’s witnesses and began to preach in that vicinity, resulting in a new company organization a year later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same circuit servant visiting another small company worked all week with a few of the publishers inviting people to the public lecture on Sunday, but found only opposed and rude people. Nevertheless, on Sunday, even though the roads were wet and muddy and not fit for walking on, people began arriving in large groups. Two hundred sixty-two attended the public talk and all but five stayed for a service talk afterward. More than half of the attendants had never before attended a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses. Only Jehovah knows those who are seeking freedom, and he is using his King to direct them to his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The united efforts of Jehovah’s servants in Costa Rica are directed toward the re-establishment of Jehovah’s pure worship, and they are determined to find, feed, educate and equip for the ministry the persons of good will whom the King is now calling out of darkness. We give thanks to Jehovah for this most blessed privilege.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark158"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba have always turned in an excellent report, and again we find an excellent group of Jehovah’s witnesses preaching the good news every month. They had a 6 per cent increase, making a total of 8,634 publishers reporting regularly. This being a year for bringing all the Kingdom publishers to maturity, the Cubans also made a great effort in this respect. They did not have any great gains in new publishers, but they certainly had the opportunity of helping those already in the truth. This did not mean that no new ones started in the service, because 678 were baptized during the year, and these too needed help. Like publishers in other countries, the Cubans were anxious to get into the unassigned territory work; so they moved out into fields that had not been touched very often in times past. In other places they just did not have any isolated territory. The report of the branch servant is very interesting. It shows us what the Cubans have done in aiding the prisoners to come forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year a big witness was given in the hospitals over the question of blood transfusions. Jehovah’s witnesses still get sick and some must go to the hospitals to be operated on. Most hospitals require that blood be donated for the one being operated on. Naturally, the brothers refused and this resulted in an opportunity for them to give a good witness concerning God’s purposes. At times there would be up to fifteen or twenty doctors and nurses congregated, listening to the Scriptural evidence presented by the brothers. In the past year a number of Jehovah’s witnesses have been operated on without receiving blood transfusions and all have had rapid recoveries, to the surprise and consternation of the doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many will remember 1952 as the cleanup year. Going into the faraway, hard-to-reach places to give the testimony and find the sheeplike persons was a challenge to the brothers. Could they do it? Here it is not so easy to get to these isolated places. Almost everyone must go by public transportation, whether it be bus, boat, train or plane. One unit of Havana chose the Isle of Pines, which lies about 100 miles off the southern coast of Cuba. Twice they made the trip. The first time 26 brothers went by train and boat at a cost of $430. The second time 13 went over by plane at a cost of $200. The placement of literature was astounding and the experiences of the brothers were thrilling. On the first trip they placed 127 books, 364 booklets, 390 magazines and 7 subscriptions; this in spite of heavy rains. On their second trip they presented three public lectures, one in the National prison for men, another in a theater and the third in a public park, with a combined attendance of 349. The brothers of this unit made sacrifices, overcame obstacles and carried to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pineros</span><span class="font5"> the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Central unit of Havana rented a bus for almost every week end of the campaign in unassigned territory, at a cost of hundreds of dollars to the brothers. What was the result noted? Several towns with the surrounding rurals were thoroughly worked, much literature was placed, hundreds of names of good-will persons were turned in to the Society, and new zeal was put into the brothers. Hours per publisher climbed to 16.7 and attendance at the meetings swelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experiences arrive from every part of the republic, telling of the hardships endured, the sacrifices made to reach the unassigned territory. Brothers from the company of Pinar del Rio, having to travel far to their territory, made plans to stay in the territory three days. They carried food and cooking utensils. They found so much good will that the sisters were given beds to sleep in in the homes of good-will persons, and the brothers were given an empty house where they could hang their hammocks. Many good-will slips were sent in to the Society from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not all companies could work unassigned territories, because there was no unassigned territory near them. The company of Cueva de Agua (Water Cave), which has 78 publishers associated, has only 600 homes to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The response to the letters sent to the people living in unassigned territory is already being noted. One sailor living on the Isle of Pines wrote: “I have in my possession two letters that were sent to me, in which I see the humanitarianism of this Society, in interesting itself in the betterment of humanity,” etc. Another says: &quot;I pray that you will forgive me for not having answered sooner your very much esteemed letters, with which you have honored me in fulfillment of your missionary service,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past service year seven Cuban brothers graduated from Gilead and five of them are already in their new assignment in Nicaragua. Two others are serving as circuit servants, awaiting the time when they will be able to reach their new assignment too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year was another blessed one for all Jehovah’s true servants. They saw many prisoners released from the Babylonian organization and have rejoiced in having had a share in their release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We shall all continue to unite our voices in invitation to the prisoners to ‘come forth’, until there are no more to come forth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes it appears that Jehovah’s witnesses are running up against a stone wall when they meet with mob action and terrible persecution on the part of religious fanatics. But the wall disappears in time, and Jehovah’s witnesses keep on telling the prisoners to go forth. The witnesses in Cyprus had to take much beating during the year, but despite this there has been a marked increase in the number of publishers, 15 per cent, in fact. The attendance of 386 at the Memorial was very good, and they have an average of 313 publishers; so there are still many more who are interested in what they are doing. The work in Cyprus was outstanding this year, and you will be very much interested in what the branch servant reports as to their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your visit and that of Brother Henschel to our island in December 1951 was a long-awaited event, since you had never visited us before. A thrill ran throughout the congregations in Cyprus when the brothers learned of your impending visit. Our joy was increased when you were obliged to return a second time for two days in order to secure visas for entry into other lands. Those days will always be remembered by us, together with your counsel and admonition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your visit and the activity of the brothers at that time really upset the Greek Orthodox Church. No less than 17 articles appeared in one of the leading newspapers “exposing” Jehovah’s witnesses. Naturally such articles stir up questions in the minds of the people, and Jehovah’s servants used to the full the opportunity given. This was only a prelude to the dark storm clouds appearing on the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses were preparing themselves for the summer campaign of witnessing in the rural territories. The leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church seemed to have the same notion. The archbishop declared a “Gospel week”. All the bishops, priests, theologians and leading monks were scheduled to visit all the towns and villages of the island. But what kind of “gospel” did they take to the people? War against Jehovah’s witnesses, exposure of the antichrist, ways and means of combating the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses and their final ousting from Cyprus. The people were told that “when Jehovah’s witnesses visit your village or town, throw them out”. What could be expected from persons, many of whom are illiterate and whose lives are centered around their religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first round of trouble commenced at our circuit assembly in the town of Famagusta. The assembly proceeded with excellent results. Due to past experiences we wondered what would happen at the public meeting. Ten minutes before the talk was due to begin, with 350 persons already seated, a mob appeared. Six priests together with scores of young men from one of the secondary schools in the town made their way to enter the building where the talk was to be given. We knew what their entrance to the hall would mean, as their purpose was to break up the meeting and take over. They were stopped at the entrance, and our attendants and members of the police kept them out, but not without a struggle. One priest declared that he was going to get in even if he died. The demonized priests then assaulted an attendant and tore his clothes. The mob tried to use force to enter and as their fury raged the doors of the hall were locked. Thwarted in their purpose, the leading priest commenced to give a speech against Jehovah’s witnesses in the road outside the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than an hour passed and the church bells began to ring calling the people to church to hear another tirade against Jehovah’s servants. The priests led the mob back to a nearby church just as the public talk was ending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inasmuch as three quarters of the population of Cyprus live in the rural areas, the brothers undertook the rural work with enthusiasm. Yes, the “leading lights” of the Orthodox Church had gone ahead and warned the villagers against us and that we must not be allowed to set foot in any village. The brothers were not daunted; the Lord Jesus’ sheep must be found. It would mean more trouble. What resulted? More storms with bright periods. Some villages received the brothers well, and many interesting experiences were related by the brothers. In one out-of-the-way village persons who had taken literature years before without any further visits had learned the truth, left the religious system and preached to the people. Imagine the joy of these people when they saw the brothers. They had stood for the truth despite bitter opposition. It is even difficult for brothers to enter the village to assist these people, due to religious opposers, but they are being cared for through the theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers working in the rural territories were rewarded for their hard labors. Despite beatings and stonings they gathered together several persons of good will, drove off the religious “blackbirds” and fed Jesus’ sheep. A company has been established in a village with four publishers who are “shining” forth the truth to their fellow villagers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other villages were not so responsive to the truth. The company in the capital of the island, reporting on their activities in the rural areas, wrote the following experience. Twenty brothers assembled early one Sunday morning to go by bicycle to villages two hours’ journey away. Three villages were to be covered. The largest village had a party of ten witnesses and smaller groups went to the other villages. In one of the smaller villages the brothers had been driven out by 10: 30 a.m. The largest village had almost been completed with good results When the fury of another storm broke over their heads and proved to be one of the worst of the year. Two brothers in the center of the village had chairs brought down on their heads and stones were hurled at them as they made their way out of the village. The village priest gathered together a mob about 200 strong to round up the other witnesses. Beating tin cans and arming themselves with heavy sticks on the way, the search for the other brothers began. A brother and sister were found. Sticks landed on the back of the brother and stones on the sister. The same happened with most of the other brothers. They were marched through the village with sticks and stones landing on their bodies. The welts caused through beating, together with the cuts and bruises, were later to be a testimony against the people when the brothers had to report to the government hospital for examination. This is what false religion does for a community, but such acts of violence will open the eyes of sincere seekers for truth to see who are the real Christians and friends of the people. A marked division in the people has been seen, and lovers of righteousness from both the Christian and Moslem communities are taking their stand for Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As showers in a parched land, so Jehovah’s servants in this island of the sea will refresh those hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Jehovah’s work of warning must be done; and his servants here, conscious of his care and protection during the past service year, will continue to “shine as the stars in the firmament”, saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This once free and prosperous country of Czechoslovakia is now behind the Iron Curtain. Jehovah’s witnesses had freedom of speech and freedom of worship at one time since the second world war, and good progress was made. However, since the Communists have taken over they have been ruling with an iron hand, taking away freedom of worship, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Jehovah’s witnesses are having a difficult time in Czechoslovakia. It would be unwise to give detailed reports of what is being done, but it can be reported that there are many faithful and true witnesses standing firm and still preaching the good news. The Communists are doing everything they can to stop the work, but they will not succeed, because they are fighting against God. We pray that Jehovah will continue to bless and strengthen the brothers there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is good to see the work continually moving ahead in Denmark. There is no closed season for finding the other sheep. Jehovah’s witnesses must hunt for these throughout the whole year, whether it be in Christmas season or during summer vacation. Careful planning and sticking to the work month by month on the part of the publishers are what bring great results in any land. There have been no difficulties in Denmark other than the usual opposition that Jehovah’s witnesses receive from the clergy, and the work there goes grandly on, with another increase of 12 per cent in number of publishers. An average of 6,056 are now in the field every month, with a new peak of 6,206 during one month. We know there is more happiness in giving than in receiving. The branch servant has sent in his yearly report and a few excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year began during our national convention when you were here. The blessings received during the convention brought forth good fruit. During the month of October we had an all-time peak of 6,086 publishers. In April we had 6,199 and in May 6,206. The 6,000 mark was passed eight times during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three-month campaign in the rural territory was supported with enthusiasm by the servants and the publishers. It is hoped that study groups will be organized in these distant territories so that more companies can be established in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new theocratic ministry course was a glad surprise. A study of the Christian Greek Scriptures using various Danish Bibles for comparison was inaugurated. We were happy for this provision and for seeing that this splendid course could be transferred to non-English-speaking countries without any great difficulty. Once again the good old Bible was made new to us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the postwar period did not bring what it was supposed to, many are disgusted with human schemes, and they begin to pay attention to the message of Jehovah’s witnesses, which is being more and more forcefully brought to the attention of the people by all means of advertising. As more and more people of good will have taken their stand, it has been possible to intensify the house-to-house work and also street witnessing. Street witnessing was introduced in Denmark five years ago, and in the beginning the people smiled and thought it was an extraordinary idea to go on the streets with the magazines. The persistence and determination of the witnesses in doing this work have in course of time, however, earned the respect of many people, and now they are experiencing the results of their patient labors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy in this country have a big problem which Jehovah’s witnesses do not have, namely, to get in touch with the people. One friendly clergyman wrote some time ago: “To get in touch with the workers and youth, Jehovah’s witnesses do not need to alter their preaching to include national, social and educational lectures. The message they bring is so powerful in itself that thinking people cannot do other than listen to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The water of life is flowing freely in this country without serious interference. Of course, many are opposed to the work, but reports of violent opposition are extremely scarce, and no real mob actions have ever been reported as in Catholic or totalitarian countries. The clergy do not like to see the increase of Jehovah’s witnesses. Oftentimes they speak against the witnesses from their pulpits; but this does not stop Jehovah’s witnesses, it only makes them grow in numbers. Not very long ago the leader of the Danish Inner Mission admitted that the church was going downhill. He told that many mission houses have been sold recently because nobody attended the meetings. It is different with Jehovah’s witnesses—more and more Kingdom Halls are being built all over the country. These halls serve as centers for the true worship in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we are determined to press on and have the Kingdom trumpet sound more ana more forcefully so that still more prisoners will heed the message of freedom and thus leave the political and religious prison houses of this old world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark166"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It certainly is good to have received a report from our fellow slaves in the Dominican Republic. Even though there is and has been a ban on the work for quite some time, the spiritual food reaches into that land. The brothers feed upon it and take it to the other sheep. Persecution in that country has increased the strength and zeal of our brothers. Now they look at the difficulties which arise as something to be expected and not feared Everyone knows that the Dominican Republic has a dictator, is ruled by an iron hand, and that freedom of worship has been completely taken away from the people. You must vote the way the government says it wants you to vote, and if you do not you are persecuted, especially if you happen to ne one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Many of our brothers and sisters have spent much time in jail, but when they get out of jail they usually come out with more publishers, because they have preached to political prisoners and others in the prison houses. They have found an excellent ou-portunity to tell others of What is wrong with this present world and what the real hope for mankind is. Even though our brothers there do not have much of this world’s goods, they have the greatest thing in the world, the words of life. These they are giving to the people of the nation, saying to them, ‘You prisoners, come forth.’ And they are coming. From a report that was received from the Dominican Republic, the following is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one time during the year, right after the recent election, there were 80 brothers and sisters in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For example, consider the recent “election”. There was only one candidate and voting was voluntary. Yet when soldiers and police began picking up brothers who did not have “voted” stamped on their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cedulas,</span><span class="font5"> they were put in prison and for them the election was not so “voluntary”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the secretary of interior and police was asked why these people were arrested and put in prison, he blandly said, “Because these, when asked, stated publicly that they were Jehovah’s witnesses.” This in itself was enough to have mothers with tiny babies put in filthy prisons, and to have their babies snatched away from them without telling them where they had been left. One of the arrested ones was a 60-year-old sister. Luckily the friends had foresight enough to provide their own beds, because the prisons have only a wide plank on which to sleep. Experiences like these have given strength to the brothers and made them have faith in the Great Protector, Jehovah. The result to the brothers has been strengthening, like the experience that Israel had with Jehovah’s power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our increase has come mostly from persons who knew of the truth before the ban and who have now taken heart through study and have become mature in knowledge. We also have a few who have heard of the truth by the wide publicity given Jehovah’s witnesses in their court trials and other testings. Many have seen how faithful Jehovah is if you put your trust in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We thank all the brothers for their kind letters of encouragement and their help in getting us the ‘food convenient’ from our mother. We look ahead to greater service privileges and opportunities to help our brothers here and those who are seeking the waters of life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers in Ecuador feel that they have made progress in spite of the fact that there is a slight decrease in number of publishers. The progress they have made is in maturity. Those who have been in the truth for a year or longer have become more stable and understanding in their knowledge. Further, the report shows that fewer publishers on the average for each month have spent 3,000 more hours in the field service, which shows greater maturity. They placed more magazines, more bound books, obtained a larger number of subscriptions, made 2,000 more back-calls and conducted more Bible studies than during the previous year. So those who are devoted to Jehovah have done a greater work in witnessing in Ecuador because they are more mature. We sincerely hope these will continue in their maturity during the coming year and help the new ones to take their stand for the Kingdom and begin preaching the good news. The branch servant tells of some interesting happenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interesting report comes from one of our persons of good will who is a native of Loja. He has been living in Guayaquil and has studied with one of the missionaries there for only three months. Having a knowledge of medicine, he spends the summer months walking many miles on foot among the poor people of Ecuador, who live completely isolated in the middle of the jungles, to give them medical treatment which is not otherwise available. But this summer he prepared himself to do some spiritual healing too and carried the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> on each trip. He reports finding many people who have no religion whatever and who are fascinated to hear about the Scriptures and the new world. They are unable to read, but each evening he would gather a few families together and read and explain to them the chapters of the book which he had studied with the missionary. Now he requests that we send a missionary with him on some of his trips, as the work is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have found the tracts to be an excellent instrument for starting the witness while traveling. One of the missionaries on vacation passed some out among his traveling companions while they were having lunch together. One of them was a university student and got really inquisitive about our work. They were going to the same destination but, as the missionary had never been there before, the young man offered to spend some time showing him the city. In the few days that followed, he visited the missionary four times, each time bringing some new people with him. The placement of the tract resulted in an opportunity to study with eight different persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A group of 22 brothers arrived at a small town and began work about 8:30 a.m. In no time the chief of the clergy knew they had arrived and soon a loud-speaker in the center of the town was blaring out that seven American Protestants were going about trying to conquer all the people. Apparently the clergy had not noticed the many national brothers. The voice told the people to say they were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cat6licos apost6licos romanos. </span><span class="font5">If anyone had already taken literature, it should be burned. However, about half an hour later the loudspeaker suddenly became silent. Just then a man drove up to two of the sisters and said there would be no more announcements against our work, as he had turned off the electrical power and it would stay off till our work was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we have been able to start organized work in two new locations. One of these is a coastal city where five missionaries began work in February. Interest was so manifest that they held an organized </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study right from the beginning. By the third meeting the attendance was already reaching into the teens and the clergy got worried. For the first time in his life the priest had to get out into the hot tropical sun and visit his flock. Some were very much surprised when the priest came to see them for the first time in their lives—and then to frighten them out of studying the Bible! He even instituted a spy system near the missionary home to make sure that all who attended the meetings would be “marked” for special visits. At least twice a week he devoted sermons to the subject of Jehovah’s witnesses. He suggested to the owner of the missionaries’ apartment that he put them out, told the water carriers not to sell them water, threatened a theater owner who rented them his cinema for a public talk—and all to no avail. The meeting attendance has continued to climb and the sheep are being marked for life. The two existing Protestant sects in the town are also seeing their prisoners go free. One young man who had until recently had a responsible position in one of the churches said, after attending his first meeting, “Why, you are the only people who really know who God is, and you prove it by your manner of prayer. You pray to a God ‘whose name is Jehovah’. It’s definite; no ambiguity. You know where you are going and now at last I’ve found my direction too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For us in Ecuador the theme must remain, “Work on maturity.” It seems that we have been working uphill in the past year, but the wheels are turning. We are happy to begin this new year by celebrating our first district assembly and by receiving six new missionaries, bringing our number up to 35. The beginning will be a good one and we aim to keep it up.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Even amidst political upheaval and turmoil among the people, the work in Egypt has moved along very well. Jehovah’s witnesses in Egypt are happy about their expansion. While the difficulties and internal strife in the country made many</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">people afraid, Jehovah’s witnesses continued to preach and were able to comfort many who were mourning. God’s servants have confidence in their Maker, and they are anxious to give to others that which they have received from their Creator. There are now 228 publishers in Egypt who engage in the field service regularly every month. They reached a new peak of 247, which shows that there are many more who can be brought to maturity and regular worship of Jehovah in holy array. The branch servant in Cairo sends in a report on Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Excerpts from these reports follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most important event of the year was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel in January. This was the second visit of the president of the Society, the first being five years ago, in 1947. At that time, only 62 publishers were reporting in this land of the Nile. A branch office was opened in Cairo, and since then there has been a steady increase in number of publishers, till now we have 228 regular in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One week after the assembly great disturbances took place in Cairo; the troublemakers burnt many of the shops and hotels. The well-known Shepherd’s Hotel, where Brother Knorr had stayed only one week previous, was burnt to ashes. The mob approached the building where the Society’s branch is located on the second floor to burn it, but, thanks to Jehovah God, who always protects his people, the mob did not succeed, being able to bum only an apartment on the ground floor, although three times they tried to come up to the second floor. The next day we were overjoyed to learn that all the brothers in Cairo were safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this service year the brothers had good experiences in the field. When among us Brother Knorr gave us instructions to distribute all Greek booklets to the Greek-speaking people. Packets of ten booklets were made, and during the month of May the brothers distributed these packets in the different towns and villages. Throughout this campaign 26,934 booklets were distributed to the people. This campaign upset the clergymen and they started to warn the people against Jehovah’s witnesses in their churches, saying: “Do not accept them or their literature.” After having given the message to a clergyman, a sister offered him some booklets. This clergyman replied: &quot;Go away from here and do not go to any of the sheep of my flock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instructions were issued by the Society to work three months during the summer in unassigned territories. We had good results, and this is shown by the various experiences of the brothers. A brother went with a sister to an unassigned territory outside of Alexandria. They knocked at many doors, but the majority of the people were not home. They were told that most of the people were out on the beach, so they decided to go and work there. When they started to preach one of the hearers told them that he had just come back from the church where he heard the priest speaking against them. He told the sister to go and see the priest, who was swimming a little distance from there, and if the latter would accept the witness, then she could come back and he would listen to her. The two publishers found the priest and gave him the message of the establishment of the Kingdom. The priest said that just that day he spoke against Jehovah’s witnesses in the church. “I spoke against you,” the priest continued, “because many are against you. I have never in my life met the witnesses of Jehovah, but what you say is true and with pleasure I shall buy the literature you offer me.” The person watching the discussion from a distance was astonished to see how the priest who spoke against them took the literature readily. On returning, the surprised person immediately took books and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> During the month, 39 subscriptions were obtained by the sister. Many people who subscribed as a result of these witnessing efforts on the beach are on vacation from Upper Egypt, and it is hoped that when they return to their homes they will speak to others, and later study groups and companies will spring up in the towns of Upper Egypt. To climax the service year we arranged a district assembly in Alexandria, the summer holiday resort of Egypt, and from the 8th to the 10th of August Jehovah’s witnesses from all parts of Egypt met together to honor Jehovah’s name. This assembly was the best ever for that city; 12 persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion, and the total attendance of the public talks in three languages was 235.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enthusiasm of the brothers reached its climax on Sunday evening during the final talk when it was announced that three Gilead graduates were on their way to Egypt and that they were to work with the units of Alexandria to advance the pure worship among the people of good will. This had been the wish of the brothers of Alexandria for a long time and their wish was realized when the brothers arrived on the 29th of August. A few days previous a missionary home was obtained for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the brothers have settled in their new home and are taking the responsibilities of the local units. The local brothers are co-operating with them, and this new service year we look forward to still greater increase as the other sheep are found and fed with the spiritual food, and progress on to maturity of knowledge, joining with us in saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.” In closing we send our love to you and the Bethel family, and we thank you all for your efforts to help keep us supplied with the necessary equipment for the teaching work and to expand the pure wo-ship. Please convey our love to all our brothers throughout the earth as you have opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>LIBYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A few brothers in Tripoli, the capital of Libya, are making every endeavor to take the life-giving message to the people. A great part of the work is done among the Italian-speaking people who live in this country, and this message upsets the religious leaders of the Italian colony there who repeatedly speak in their churches against the brothers. The Roman Catholic clergy of this country are making great efforts to oppose Jehovah’s work. The brothers were informed by a subscriber for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine that her mother heard a “Pastoral Letter” read while attending a religious service in the church. It had been written by the bishop of Tripoli and distributed to all Catholic churches in a “circular”. Among other things it said that there would be persons having doubts about religious doctrines, and that they should not delay to call on the priest of their respective church, who will have great pleasure in helping such ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, the priests are not interested in aiding people to learn from the Bible. Just because an individual had meetings, was studying the books of Jehovah’s witnesses and reading what he called a Protestant Bible a priest made every effort to cause the brother trouble. He even went to the head of the firm that employed the brother, saw the manager, and tried to get him to dismiss the brother from his work. The priest was unsuccessful in this because the manager inquired as to the activities of his employee and found out that he was studying the Bible and having Bible meetings at his home. Even though the manager was the head of the Catholic Action organization, he saw no reason why people should not study the Bible. The bishop himself had said that it would be a pleasure for the church to help persons in their questions, so the manager advised the brother to go to the priest. The brother’s sister did go to the priest, but the priest became angry and would not answer her questions; so the whole matter was explained to the employer, and he was very much disturbed that the priest should act in that manner. This caused quite a stir among all the people who worked with the brother, and he was able to give a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About six months ago an ex-offlcer of the Italian army now on pension was invited to the Kingdom Hall by a person who heard the message but did not take a stand for it. After the meeting was closed the ex-officer raised a few questions and was pleased to come back. Five weeks later he came back to visit the brothers at the Kingdom Hall. He began to say to the brothers that he was the son of a Protestant pastor and that during his childhood and even manhood he received Bible education according to the Protestant faith and this was the first time he heard such interesting things regarding the Bible. This ex-officer is now a publisher reporting field service, sharing in the regular door-to-door work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are a few in Sudan who want to worship the Most High God in spirit and in truth. However, the religious opposition is great in this land. To show how prejudiced false religion is toward one of Jehovah’s witnesses, it so happened that a brother’s wife died by accidental electrocution. Because the brother wanted the funeral handled by one of Jehovah’s witnesses and wanted all the candles and other false religious symbols removed from the home, neither the neighbors nor his friends would have anything to do with him, and burial in the regular cemetery was denied. The body had to be interred on government ground set aside for all religions. This caused quite a bit of talk and disturbance in the city, but the brother stands firm and continues to preach the good news. It was difficult for him even to find a lodging place, and he finally moved into a hotel which was being run by a Jew. It was in the garden of this hotel that 32 persons were able to attend a meeting. These people came, you might say, from every nation, kindred and tongue, because the talk had to be given in three different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the Sudan is just getting started. Perhaps during the next year greater progress can be made, the other sheep found, and a good company organized. Right now there are 14 brothers who are interested in the truth and are doing some preaching, and with this little group much can happen. Work in every country began with just small groups. Even though the people generally are against Jehovah’s witnesses, some good-will persons come by a giving of the truth that those publishers have.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A situation has existed in Central and South American countries which has been hard to deal with. Most of the countries dealt with it at the time when </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> came out in 1947 on the subject of marriage and showed that proper living is necessary to gain Jehovah’s approval. In the past year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> pointed out again that it is necessary to keep the organization of God clean. The report on El Salvador by the branch servant shows us that Jehovah’s blessing will always be upon a clean organization. While there are no more publishers in the field today than there were a year ago, still the 17,000 more hours devoted to field service show that those who are clean are happy to work harder when brought to maturity. There were great increases in number of new subscriptions obtained and individual magazines placed. Nine thousand more back-calls were made and eighty more Bible studies conducted monthly. All of this shows what can be done with the same number of publishers when brought to maturity. But let us have the branch servant tell his story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once to the task of outlining the work for the coming year, the one big problem which kept looming up no matter how we viewed the situation was an aggravating lack of maturity on the part of our brothers throughout the republic. The brothers knew doctrine well. They were going in the service regularly; there was even a good growth in numbers, but their dependence upon the missionaries for arranging even their personal field-service program and their lack of initiative in the organization spoke for itself as to the maturity of perhaps one third of the publishers. There was increase, yes; but the ability of the national organiza-tlon to care for itself was not keeping pace with that increase. Lack of maturity, yes; but what was the cause, and how was it to be overcome? The effect we could see; so back there a year ago we drew up our outline for the next twelve months on the basis of Brother Knorr’s over-all suggestions and planned to meet our own local obstacles head on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our maturity campaign was launched at the San Salvador assembly where the year’s problems with their proposed solutions were explained frankly and plainly to the brothers. The assembly was an outstanding success. The brothers saw the point, and everyone left for his home satisfied and fully informed as to the 1952 republic-wide theme of action. Six hundred and forty had attended the public talk at the Follies theater, and much interest had been aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then in January we had unexpected help. As Brother Knorr’s personal representative, Brother T. H. Sieben-list and his wife paid us a welcome official visit as part of a tour of many Latin-American countries. He reviewed our problems, and put his finger on the cause immediately: our organization was not clean. Our brothers were still clinging to the old-world standards of marriage. Many were still living with marriage partners without troubling themselves to have the arrangement legalized. Red-faced, we had to admit it. As we sat around the long table in the branch home listening, we could see that we had been asleep at the switch! Of course, the situation had not been ignored through the history of pioneering the work here, but our talking had not been respected—it had no teeth to it. Now was the time for the organization to put its foot down! We had been too fearful of losing numbers, to the hurt of the quality of our organization, but as of February 1, 1952, all persons not living right according to the Bible could no longer be counted as Jehovah’s witnesses until such time as they should straighten out their lives. Those who sincerely turned around and changed their course were not disfellowshiped but were helped with their problems. Sometimes we had to rack our brains because of the profound complexity of the situations. El Salvador’s report for February showed that we had dropped 100 publishers from our last peak, but we were determined to see the matter through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Siebenlist did much actual field work, aiding the brothers to present the message better. We had the chance to see him demonstrate in the field how he used the Bible itself in his doorstep presentation. This had a good effect on the people, causing them to listen more attentively than usual. For us it was fresh, new and different. In all Brother Siebenlist addressed audiences in four cities; and in just two theater talks he spoke to more than 1,500 persons of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">March, April and May passed, and we all felt better. There was a good, clean feeling in the whole organization. All the old &quot;hangers-on” had cleared out. Our good publishers had straightened themselves out, and we could really feel Jehovah’s spirit and blessing on the work. We worked as hard as before, yes; but now we could see something for it; we could </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">feel</span><span class="font5"> the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through those past months so many of our brothers had legalized their marriages and the missionaries had appeared as witnesses so many times at the city hall that even Mayor Trabanino caught the spirit of our efforts and would say after marrying a couple, “Keep going in this same way.” Jehovah’s witnesses had even won the respect of men of the world who saw that what we were trying to do was the best thing that had happened to their people; and in their own way they cheered us. Our reputation for high moral standards got around. It was beginning to attract people instead of repelling them. Responsible persons in the world were taking notice and applauding us. You bet we were happy—all 200 of us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sure our publishers were down in numbers, but total hours refused to drop, but even climbed. The publishers were marvelous; they dug in and made more back-calls and conducted more studies than ever before in the history of the republic. We did not need those who had left at all; we only thought we did. We had not realized that what was important was dedication to Jehovah and not to a work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first month in which the new Spanish Bible tracts were used in the field one missionary gave a Bible tract to a storekeeper while she drank a soda. When she took out her money to pay the man, he said, “Let’s see; that’ll be two col6ns and fifty centavos (2.75 minus the drink); isn’t that right?<sup>r</sup>’ The missionary was really puzzled, because that was much more than her drink was worth; but the man explained that he wanted to subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and that amount was what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> owed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">her.</span><span class="font5"> He had read the advertisement on the back of the tract while she was being refreshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We now happily end this service year grateful to Jehovah for his patience and for the strength of his spirit which keeps us on the right track in spite of our clumsiness. The number of publishers has climbed back to where it was before; our organization is clean; the brothers have a true and strong balance of understandIng and appreciation and are doing their own work. We who feel better for it tighten our belts for another year of blessed service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work continues to advance in Finland, and there are now 393 companies organized throughout that land of the north. The other sheep are coming out of religious bondage. Some of the experiences related from there are very interesting. The publishers are becoming more mature, but there is still much room for the gathering together of those who are seeking truth and righteousness. As those of Jehovah’s organization in all parts of the world march on together, they worship Jehovah in holy array. The following portions of the report from Finland have been marked for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our 1951-1952 service year was opened with great joy and feasting. The president of the Watch Tower Society, Brother Knorr, and his secretary, Brother Henschel, arrived in Finland on September 3 for a weeklong visit with the friends in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finnish and Swedish are both official languages in Finland. This has presented a problem for some time, as some companies have both Swedish and Finnish brothers who cannot speak the other’s language. Brother Knorr suggested that separate Swedish companies be organized. During the past service year this was done, with good results. Now the Swedes in Finland have their own circuit servant, and twice a year the district servant comes over from Sweden. It is thrilling to see the increase in the number of young publishers among the Swedish group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more prisoners are coming out of Babylon. One circuit servant reports that he went with a brother and sister to the priest of the state church to take their names off the church books. When the priest learned that the circuit servant was one of Jehovah’s witnesses he became angry and shouted: “Get out of here at once.” The brother pointed out that these people had asked him to come with them as an assistant and that according to Finnish Religious Freedom Law these people may separate from the church, and that he would not leave before his work was done. Enraged still more the priest threatened to call the police. The policeman who came was an honest man who had himself separated from the church. He said that an assistant could be used and was legal. The result was that the priest was forced to take their names off the church books in the presence of police, circuit servant and two new witnesses who were greatly encouraged by the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy have for a long time tried to keep the people blinded with prejudice against Jehovah’s witnesses. One young summer pioneer was witnessing from house to house. After starting a conversation, the lady of the house said: “This isn’t those ‘Jehovahites’, is it?” The witness explained that she was a witness for Jehovah. At this the householder became enraged and said that just last night in prayer meeting in the school someone had asked the pastor what he thought of Jehovah’s witnesses. The pastor explained: “Haven’t you heard what the ‘bishop’ said about those false prophets, that it is such a belief that no one should join them, when they have as their god the prince of demons himself?” A good opportunity then followed to explain the matter. The 13-year-old witness explained about God’s kingdom and his purposes. At the end of the discussion the woman had entirely changed countenance and expressed interest in the truth. The young publisher then arranged to make a back-call on her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch office received a letter from a person in isolated territory that shows how some are accepting the truth. It reads: “I am a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriber, and have read and studied the Bible with its help. I have noticed the way it presents the Bible so sincerely. I have also read many of your publications, and they have all been a great help to me in studying God’s Word. Through these I have found the way of understanding and truth, the way of salvation from this old world’s fear and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I desire to continue to study the Bible and to continue to instruct others with it. I have published the good news of the Kingdom around here, but the opposition has been great. I alone here have knowledge of the Kingdom. This community is a Laestadian center, and I am the daughter of a Laestadian preacher. I desire to work with Jehovah’s organization and ask to receive report cards. I also ask you to send the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Truth Shall Make You Free’,</span><span class="font5"> for which I enclose money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New fields of service were opened up in Finland with the unassigned territory campaign in June, July and August. One company reports that every week end during the summer they were in unassigned territory, traveling in trucks, cars and chartered buses. The highest number of publishers at one time was 56. In this territory 35 public meetings were held, one with a total of 136 in attendance. There were 187 names of good-will persons sent to the Society. In one place an elderly couple who were interested in the truth asked the publisher to arrange a public meeting in their house. The meeting was supported by witnesses advertising the meeting. Although the nearest neighbor was a half mile away, still the speaker was amazed when he saw forty in attendance. At the close of the meeting copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were distributed to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Lappland most of the people belong to the Laestad-ian movement, which includes strong belief in hellfire. Two of Jehovah’s witnesses were working there in unassigned territory. Having met with sharp answers at almost every house, they decided to try something different. They approached the head of a reindeer farm, who was known for his honesty and profound fanatical religious belief (Laestadian). He was just taking his noonday rest. In Lappland there is no hurry; so they spoke first about the weather and at the same time surveyed the living room. There in the corner was a large black Bible. “My, you have a magnificent big book there.” The host stretched himself and declared: “There is a ladder to heaven. I don’t trust those small Bibles for sale in the village.” “May I look at it?” the witness said. He then read from the Bible that the soul dies, that God’s name is Jehovah. The householder blinked his eyes and asked: “Where have you learned all that?” The witness produced a copy of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and said he had learned from it. The man examined the copyright and publishers and said: “I have always thought this society to be antichrist, but if my Bible corresponds, I am interested. I will buy this book if you agree to sell it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News of unassigned territory inspired the idea to build a boat so that the hundreds of islands in Saimaa lake region could be worked. For many weeks one brother worked faithfully all his spare time building the boat and fitting it with a motor. The results were very gratifying. Much interest was found among the islands and towns witnessed to that had never before heard the truth. In working one of the islands they met a man who said that the only religion on the island was the State Church and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Students.</span><span class="font5"> Furthermore he said they did not want any sects on the island. The brothers nevertheless started witnessing and soon found a brother who had been baptized in 1947 at the Helsinki convention. He had subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and had gone every year to the convention; but because there was no company organization he had just witnessed to the “interested” ones on the island. One of his “interested” ones was almost mature in the truth already. About eight miles away was another person who knew the truth well and had been in the field service. The brothers spent about three hours discussing the theocratic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel</span><span class="font5"> booklet, reporting service, and other matters. It is hoped that later we can start a company there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the service year the 15 Olympic games were held in Helsinki. Helsinki publishers organized a good street-witnessing campaign. In the most important places, street-work shifts were arranged with witnesses on hand almost any hour. One brother reported having distributed literature in ten different languages. Experiences of publishers’ placing five to ten magazines in an hour’s time were not unusual. As a result of an acquaintance made by Jehovah’s witnesses during the Olympic games one girl has given up athletics and turned evangelist</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark180"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in France have every reason to rejoice, because the work moves along there in good fashion. We find an 11 per cent increase in the number of publishers taking care of the Kingdom interests. Now they have 6,740 reporting service every month, to compare with 6,073 a year ago. At their Memorial in 1952 there were 10,361 in attendance; so we can easily see that there are good prospects for increase. During the year 541 persons dedicated their lives to God, symbolizing it by water baptism. During the previous year France had great increases and there were many new people in the truth who needed to be brought to maturity, and our brothers in France have looked after these very well. Additionally, they enjoyed the unassigned territory work, for France has plenty of unassigned territory. The branch servant gives us an interesting report, not only of France but also of the other countries that come under the jurisdiction of the Paris office, namely, Saar, Algeria and Tunisia.</span></p>
<div><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-5.png" alt="" style="width:155pt;height:81pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the 1952 service year, at least one quarter of the publishers were one-year-old “babes”. So we especially appreciated the policy which was set by Brooklyn of concentrat-■■ ing particularly on helping the many new ones to grow spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rich food received throughout the year in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> has greatly aided in this. To enable this French edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to print more of the material appearing in the English edition, Brother Knorr rearranged its contents. The brothers have greatly appreciated this change, because now they can enjoy many of the secondary articles and the answers to questions from readers. Additionally, the magazine is now far more attractive to present to the public. This accounts for the enthusiasm with which the brothers undertook the 14th annual </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign. The first month of the campaign last year saw 796 new subscriptions taken, whereas this year over 1,300 were taken in January, and more than 5,000 for the whole campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience well illustrates how effective </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> can be, even when there is no publisher present to explain it. Two young ladies had taken a subscription, and had subsequently been invited to attend the nearby company book study. They attended for a few weeks, but then stopped going, because, said they, their father was a severe man, and would not allow them to go out in the evening. It so happened that a married couple in the truth lived in the same apartment house, and one day the &quot;severe” father of the girls stopped and talked to the couple, not knowing they were Jehovah’s witnesses. The conversation got around to world conditions, and suddenly the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">monsieur</span><span class="font5"> exclaimed: &quot;It’s not surprising things are as they are since Satan is ruling this world.” Asked how he knew that important fact, he continued: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Eh bien!</span><span class="font5"> My two daughters subscribed to a magazine called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> some time back, but they never read it. They prefer to go to the movies. I picked up a copy one day and found it very interesting. Now I take them regularly with me to work and read them in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">M&amp;tro. </span><span class="font5">That’s where I learned that Satan is ruling this world, but I also learned that God is going to bring in a new world. Then everything will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tre bien!’<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The summer campaign of work In unassigned territories was undertaken with vigor and enthusiasm. You see, far more territory in France is unassigned than is allocated to the companies and pioneers! Millions have never heard the message preached! So the rural campaign has meant that thousands of peasants have heard the truth for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One company reports that on its first trip to unassigned territory one such “lost sheep” was found. This lady had read many of the Society’s books before the war, and had even attended some of the meetings held In Paris. But due to the Nazi occupation she had lost contact with us. After the liberation she went to the address where the Society had its offices before the war, but the concierge told her that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> was disbanded. After this she tried to find us through one of the Bible societies, but with no success. And now, through the summer campaign, Jehovah’s witnesses were back in her home town, and holding a series of public talks in the hall right next to her house! She nearly hugged the publisher who first called at her home, and was thrilled at the public meeting to find some of those who were attending the meetings before the war present and still going strong. She quickly took all the publications that had been published in French since then, and subscribed to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;veillez-vous!</span><span class="font5"> Other similar experiences have been had during the summer campaign. The Good Shepherd knows where his sheep are, and experiences such as these convince us that he is directing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A group of twelve brothers decided to go off for several days to work a small town in unassigned territory. When they tried to get lodgings at the village hotel, the lady innkeeper eyed the twelve, with their cases and several cartons of books, somewhat suspiciously. But her face brightened up when she heard they were in town to preach about God’s kingdom. “You remind me of the twelve apostles!” she remarked. The brothers had an interesting time in the town, although some of them were arrested by gendarmes. However, upon learning of their work, the mayor released them, and said it was the local Catholic clergy who had had them arrested. In the evening the innkeeper opened up a room for a public Bible discussion, and she and fourteen others attended. At the end of the evening, a Catholic schoolteacher remarked, “It’s fantastic how the church can deceive one into believing such lies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such rural work had its humorous moments. One group of publishers who wished to stay overnight in a village so as to be able to finish it the next day found the only place available was a bam. They said it was quite an experience sleeping twenty feet up on top of a haystack, with cows and horses on the lower deck! But at least they did not go hungry, because during the day many of the peasants had been glad to obtain the books through the barter arrangement, that is, a series of three books for six eggs, a pot of jam and a rabbit! But it was with such a will to overcome all obstacles that the brothers in France undertook the summer campaign, and a great witness has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholicism and protestantism cannot hold the sheep back. And even godless communism is yielding up good-will persons taken captive by it. A lady who had taken some of our books was unable to arrange for a study in her home because of her Communist husband. One day, however, the person’s sister-in-law was present when the publisher made a back-call, and became so interested in the message that she wanted a study in her home. It was arranged, and soon yet another sisterin-law was attending. By this time it had become such a family affair that the Communist husband of the first lady started looking into the matter for himself. Now one of the sisters-in-law is baptized, the others are continuing their studies and the Communist husband will not hear a word against </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Les t&amp;moins de J6hova</span><span class="font5"> and has shown real good will toward the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is with great joy that a report can be included this year on a new territory which is opening up, namely, the island of Corsica. This island of the Mediterranean, 150 kilometers from the Riviera, is considered a part of France. There were no publishers on the island until July 1952, when two special pioneers were assigned there. These were joined in the summer months by visiting company publishers from the mainland, ana between them they placed 446 books, 1,274 booklets, 282 magazines and made 266 back-calls, resulting in five home Bible studies. These splendid results were obtained in spite of clergy opposition. Priests forbade their parishioners to take or read our literature, but the above report shows how much the people took heed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And so looking back on the 1952 service year, we can thank Jehovah for the way he has blessed us. The number of publishers has not increased as strikingly as during the preceding years, yet real progress has been made in helping the new ones to maturity. In addition, the summer campaign has brought the message to thousands who had never heard it before, and a determined effort will be made to keep these scattered sheep in contact with the organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>ALGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the past service year the work of liberation has stretched out to embrace new territories, reaching out to Algeria, where, in the city of Algiers, four special pioneers from France were sent in June 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Algeria, with a population of over 8,600,000, is the chief French colony situated in the north of the African continent and bordering the Mediterranean sea. Life there is not at all the same as in France, as these special pioneers quickly learned. They had to study the habits of the people and take into consideration the conditions in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes it is necessary for the sisters to work in pairs; otherwise they would be molested by the Arabs. The natives are very jealous too, and thus one has to be careful when talking to the womenfolk. In this country Jehovah’s witnesses are unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries are now getting more accustomed to the hot climate, and it is good to note that they are placing a good quantity of literature, thus preparing the way for back-calls and Bible studies. They already conduct seven Bible studies, and after two months’ activity they have started a new publisher in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here, indeed, is virgin territory, where doubtless the Lord Jesus has many of his other sheep, and these he will have gathered out and trained in his sacred service before the wintertime of Armageddon sets in.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The past year has been a difficult one for the brothers living in the Saar, but it has also been a blessed year of service. The Saar is indeed a veritable stronghold of Catholicism where the people are held in fear of the priests who threaten with excommunication any who do not mutely accept the teachings of the Roman Church and who do not obey the priest Implicitly. Jehovah’s witnesses are the particular target of the Catholic Hierarchy, who let nothing deter them in their efforts to thwart the preaching activities of these faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer who is also a company servant writes: “When our company took over some new outlying rural territory there were only two sisters in that area, and each was isolated. I arranged to go every Wednesday and Sunday to the town nearest to both of them to conduct a book study and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study with them. I also worked with them from house to house, made back-calls and conducted home Bible studies. Then over a period of a few months the whole company went regularly to that territory every Sunday by a specially hired bus. The most difficult job was to find a hall in the main city of that territory for the public meetings. In every instance the owner refused the use of the hall because of the opposition of the officials of the city under clergy influence. On one occasion sixty persons were waiting to hear the public talk. Many had traveled long distances. One man seventy years of age had journeyed for three hours on foot. Fifteen minutes before the talk was due to begin the owner of the hall refused to let us enter. Undaunted, we decided to hold the meeting in a sister’s home and the waiting people were invited there and were conveyed to the home in relays by the aid of two cars. In this way forty persons were able to hear the Kingdom message. It was a grand success! In spite of all difficulties thirty home Bible studies have been conducted, eight persons of good will have taken their stand for Jehovah’s kingdom and are now publishers determined to go ahead with the preaching work to find and feed the other sheep. We expect to form a new company there soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A company servant writes: “Working through nine villages we placed 9 books, 90 booklets, 33 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 8 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines and, of course, a good many letters for the ‘not at homes’. We are sending you 22 names and addresses of persons of good will to be followed up. We were unable to get the names and addresses of many others because of their fear of the Church and ‘His Eminence’. In three of these villages we had mobs roused against us. After twelve o’clock, when the churchgoers came out of church, it was almost impossible to work from house to house. They threw windfalls of apples and pears at us with an intensity like hail. However, in the morning between nine and twelve o’clock some people listened gladly to the good news, but they did not dare to express themselves nor to ask us questions. Seldom did they take literature and only then if it was given free. We hope, nevertheless, that the seed sown will someday bear fruit. We do feel that Jehovah has blessed this campaign and we are sure that it did make a breach in the wall of Catholic authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Saar, as in many other countries, there are many &quot;sheep” to be found and nourished to maturity. This means much work ahead for our brothers in the Saar, and certainly they will rejoice in this privilege of service as they unite with their brothers in all nations in saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>TUNISIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This report is to place Tunisia among the countries where the real liberating forces of Jehovah’s Word and spirit are now beginning to operate. In this land, situated in the north of the great African continent, with a population of over 3,200,000, there are only two publishers or fighters for the real freedom which comes from Jehovah’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One is a lady who subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the other is a young man who is doing his military service in Tunis. He gained a knowledge of the truth in France and desired to be in touch with the Society. Thus the Paris office wrote to him and to the lady, encouraging them to study and to be subscribers for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> and to share in the preaching work. They glady accepted and asked for counsel as to how to serve Jehovah efficiently. The Society gladly cooperates with these isolated publishers. Now they both engage in the house-to-house work, thus strengthening and helping each other. Without receiving personal instruction these two publishers go from house to house, place literature, obtain subscriptions, make back-calls and conduct Bible studies!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s faithful servants in Germany stand firm and rejoice in their privileges of service. When we speak of Germany we mean both Eastern and Western Germany, but the first part of this report deals with Western Germany only. Here there is freedom of speech and the brothers can move about without interference, going from house to house. Here the brothers have no fear of being trailed by secret police and being imprisoned. Western Germany is part of the democratic system where men are still allowed to live and express themselves freely and have individuality, while in Eastern Germany man has become a machine run by the state. Excellent progress has been made in Western Germany. The witnesses had a nice increase of 11 per cent during the year, and there are now 37,753 publishers regularly engaged in field service each month. Part of the city of Berlin is included in Western Germany, and a number of very fine meetings were held there during the year. It is possible for many of our brothers in Eastern Germany to come to Berlin, because it is a little part of Western Germany behind the Iron Curtain. We are very grateful that we can give much aid and comfort to our brothers in Eastern Germany from Berlin. Reports from the branch servant are very interesting and some are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year brought us much work and much joy in this country. The addition to our printery is almost completed. Much hard work by day and partly by night, in the snow, rain and wind too, was done by the brothers. As of September 1 we could count many more than 29,000 hours used only in constructing the new building for the printery. The rotary press which was sent here from Switzerland has been set up and is ready to run. Thus we will be equipped for bigger tasks in a short time. The new songbook was made in our own factory and soon the publishing of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> in German can begin, and this wonderful equipment will, without doubt, enable us to fill the great demand for Kingdom literature in our country from the branch office. We are grateful to Jehovah and to you, Brother Knorr, for this expansion, the extent of which we would not have dared to imagine some years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the unassigned territories proved to be one of great blessings. Numerous letters with wonderful, encouraging experiences were received at our office. It can be seen from them how urgent and timely it was to get out into these fallow territories and also with what joy the publishers greeted the possibility of going into new territory and meeting persons who had not at all, or very seldom, had contact with the truth. One letter reads: “We came to a house, gave a witness, and were able to start a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study with a nurse at once. After an hour, . . . the nurse asked if she could work the rest of the village with us as she was well acquainted with it. She was present at the next circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another letter we read: “We had given a witness and found hearing ears and then we were told that we would come to some emergency homes. It had not occurred to anybody before us to go that way. We placed three books in one house, but what was much more important was contacting a certain </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">young</span><span class="font5"> man. I started witnessing to him. A few minutes later the Bibles were open and a lively discussion about the Kingdom was going on. We arranged for a Bible study that evening. By then the young man had already read the chapter “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” The statement, “Jehovah’s witnesses constitute a body or group of persons dedicated to do the will of Almighty God,” had made a special impression on him. The following Sunday he came to the public meeting and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. He joined loudly in singing our Kingdom songs and said afterward that he had never experienced the like. He often expressed his thankfulness and said that he was aware of the fact that we had met him as an answer to his prayers to God. If it is Jehovah’s will, I shall have a home Bible study there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer brother worked on an island and in seven days placed 23 books, 34 booklets, 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription and 52 individual copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">He writes, “I was able to leave something in every home and often heard the desire expressed for a meeting where they could experience mutual edification in the faith and study and learn to praise the name of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark186"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>EASTERN GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Eastern Germany, the “iron curtain” of nonfreedom has been strongly established. The control of the state penetrates all public establishments, the factories, commercial firms and all means of communication. The state penetrates right into the intimate family circle, and surely the words found at Matthew 10: 36 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font6"> are being fulfilled today in this country and in many others: “Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.” A cruel terror-regime in Communist-controlled Eastern Germany keeps the population dependent on the state and entirely in slavery and permanent fear. It would be very unwise for the Society to publish the number of witnesses of Jehovah in Eastern Germany; therefore we left figures out of this part of the report. But it is a pleasure to let you know that there has been an increase, a very substantial increase, in the number of persons associating with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We will set out here some of the experiences as reported by the branch servant. Our brothers in Eastern Germany have not slacked their hands, but they certainly are working under very adverse conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under these insane circumstances of being constantly spied upon and threatened, the publishers must organize their meetings and field service. Before they call on one another they must make sure that nobody is trailing them. The preaching work from house to house seems for that reason almost impossible. In villages and small towns it is impossible, because every publisher is known as a witness of Jehovah and is under observation wherever he is. Besides this, you never know whom you have before you. How fitting are the words of Jesus, “Look! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves. Be on your guard against men.”—Matt. 10:16,17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everywhere efforts are made to get hold of the precious “food at the proper time”, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and other publications, even under danger. Because of the increased control of the mail, which includes every letter and every parcel, mailing is almost impossible. When a person is caught with Bible literature he can be sure of two or three years in prison for “distribution of instigation literature”. How precious </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is! What appreciation for this strengthening of the faith these persecuted servants of God have, an appreciation just like the inhabitants of besieged Jerusalem had for the precious water from the well of Gihon. Everywhere they try to keep up regular study even though they be just a very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year the main problem for the theocratic organization in East Germany was also the consolidating of the company organizations and making the publishers mature so that they would be able to stand the increasing pressure. Hundreds of servants are behind prison walls because of their faithfulness toward Jehovah. Everywhere, therefore, mature brothers are lacking. Many of the new publishers have never had an opportunity to work properly from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The campaign during the three summer months in unassigned territory proved to be a great help. The publishers were not known and felt freer in working from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here is the report of a company servant on some of the experiences. “We are happy to be able to say that it was a great success. In three weeks’ time we worked 22 large and small towns and placed numerous tracts and other literature. The weaker publishers and also interested persons were stimulated by the support of the more mature publishers. Many persons’ eyes were first opened through the preaching as to who Jehovah’s witnesses really are. One gentleman to whom I talked got tears in his eyes when he saw that young people were working for the Theocracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difficult circumstances force the brothers to the greatest unity and to intercede in favor of one another and to remove uncleanliness from among them, which is only for the best. The average number of publishers has increased by 33 per cent compared with the previous year. Twenty-six per cent more were present at the Memorial celebration than in the year 1951. Despite all kinds of hindrances, a large amount of Bible literature was distributed. The message was taken to places where there were no publishers and which were entirely fallow since the ban on the theocratic activity. The companies have become consolidated and many of them have become real independent theocratic bulwarks. If one servant is arrested another person will gladly take his place. If no mature and capable brother is there any more, the spirit of Jehovah stirs up a Deborah. How has such a success been possible? “Jehovah of hosts Is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.” Also during the past service year he has richly blessed the love and zeal of his devoted slaves. He has proved to be a ‘very present’ and ‘well proved help in trouble’. Our hearts are further turned to the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Much witnessing has been done during the past year in the Gold Coast in West Africa. Wonderful strides have been made in gathering together the other sheep. The report shows that there was a 27 per cent increase in the average number of publishers in the field each month, bringing that average up to 3,919. The peak of publishers for the year was 4,446. It is really good to see that approximately 900 more publishers were out in the field regularly every month, and that 1,039 were baptized. This is very good because it shows that those who are being baptized during the year are also starting in the field service and becoming regular. Outstanding in the report of the Gold Coast is the fact that the publishers are averaging 15.9 hours. Everything has increased during the year, including back-calls, home Bible studies, public meetings and distribution of literature. The branch servant looks after the work in both the Gold Coast and the Ivory Coast and there have been some interesting experiences in both of these territories. The work in the Ivory Coast is just beginning. There are only nine publishers there, but you will see the difficulties they have by reading about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Jehovah’s Witness movement has made a widespread extension into the outstations, causing great havoc,” comments the annual report of the Methodist Church. To readers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> this brief quotation speaks volumes, and we are glad to report to you about this “great havoc” upon false religion in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turning first to the grassland “desert” area of the Northern Territories we quote from a report sent in by a missionary. “The Frafra people show good will, yet are held prisoners by primitive religious customs. They fear to take a handbill. They fear to listen as we talk. They fear to associate with us because they wear no clothing; yet they love the message we carry. No, you do not knock on a door nor go through an opening into a compound, but you climb up on the flat, cementlike, mud roof by means of steps cut into a log. On approaching a compound many persons could be seen, but upon reaching it only one could be found. As we witnessed, now and again out of the comer of my eye I could see heads pop up. Finally an elderly woman came close and smiled at what she heard. Then others followed her example until out of the many holes in the adjoining roofs came several eager listeners. In their manner they thanked us over and over for coming to them. The special pioneer in this area is determined to learn the Frafra language so as to help these good will people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Wa, our next village, was 174 miles away. Here again the people would hear the Kingdom message for the first time. Since we did not know anyone in the village, imagine our surprise when directed to the home of a Syrian who prepared our room, food and bath free. The next day he insisted, ‘You have a work to do here and it’s more important than mine. I’ll cook. You do the work.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A Presbyterian teacher who studied for the ministry for nine years was made both minister and teacher. Through a study of the Watch Tower publications he began preaching the truth in church, with the result that he is now only teacher in the school. He related to us, ‘If I’m not permitted to preach the truth in church, I’ll teach it in school. If they stop me from teaching the truth in school, I’ll teach it from house to house.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The account continues, demonstrating how people of good will give a helping hand. “One woman hearing the truth for the first time exclaimed, These are truly the slaves of God. No one else would come to us like this.’ Another woman followed us making introductions at the compounds and encouraging the people to draw up stools to hear this message. Since not all could understand the language we spoke, the lady carried on in the local tongue to witness to those present. She was so delighted with our visit that she wanted handbills to take to her village three miles away to invite the people to the talk. While we were assembling at the lorry park for the talk, many lorry drivers greeted me saying they knew of the witness work in the south, and they knew these people would like to hear my talk. The drivers went here and there inviting all to come and listen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Demonstrating the willingness to preach, another report states: “In Peki a back-call person said what I was telling her must be true, for a white man would never come to her humble home and sit with her to explain the Bible and come from such a far country if it was not true. ‘Since I was a little girl I was taught in the Presbyterian Church, but never in all these years have I seen a white minister of that church go house-to-house preaching,’ she said. When asked to go with us to preach, she replied, ‘Why not? You have showed I must preach. I will go.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The progress in this French colony of the Ivory Coast is encouraging, and all the more so because it has been made against great odds. The publishers have had to work with little or no literature, due to the ban on the Society’s publications. They have had police interference with the work and arrests to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have had to overcome language and financial handicaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two Gold Coast graduates of Gilead have been in Abidjan, the capital, where all the publishers are located, just one year. At the time they arrived two pioneers were located there, but no company publisher had yet reported regularly. Now several publishers are regularly reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several months ago one of the pioneers was arrested by the police. Later he was released, but not before his house had been searched and the private library and private letter files of both pioneers and the two missionaries had been taken away. Later their Bibles were returned to them. This led to a court case and their sentences ranged from one to six months. Strange as it may seem, these sentences have not been executed against them and they are still preaching the Word in Abidjan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother from the Gold Coast branch office visited the publishers for one week during the year and gave them much encouragement and advice for their future activities. We look for further increases in 1953, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-6.png" alt="" style="width:165pt;height:77pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font6">Greece boasts of being the cradle of democracy. But its small Christian minorities like Jehovah’s witnesses are not granted democratic freedom. The government does not allow God’s faithful servants to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience. Jehovah’s organization in Greece has striven hard with government officials to try to get the necessary freedom to carry on the work and have assemblies so as to worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, but as yet to no avail. The constitution there says, “Every known religion is free, and its service rites can be performed without hindrance under protection of the laws.” But still the law will not allow us to have a Kingdom Hall, nor can we meet together peacefully. On many occasions the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses are broken up. Even when the witnesses have come together to celebrate the Lord’s evening meal, the memorial of the Lord’s death, the police have arrested those who attended. This, however, does not discourage Jehovah’s people in Greece, but the work is progressing well and arrangements are being made for expansion. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this service year Jehovah God’s blessings to his servants were without precedent. The climax was the visit of the Society’s president, Brother N. H. Knorr, and his secretary, Brother M. G. Henschel, in December 1951. As was to be expected, we did not succeed in obtaining a permit for a gathering, which would have let many brothers see and hear our visitors. However, a proper arrangement was made, and in the course of an afternoon over 900 brothers from all parts of Greece listened to the valuable counsel and admonition of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel. Brother Knorr’s speeches, having as a basic point the need for “maturity”, contained exceptional strengthening power for us all to continue increasing and improving our ministry with greater zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Great is our gratitude to Jehovah God for this blessed visit, during which many of our local problems were solved. We are particularly grateful to Jehovah for the approval given by the president to have a Bethel home built in Athens, in order to shelter in a single building all services of the Greek branch, hitherto located at several points in the city. I gladly mention here that on April 10, 1952, the Memorial day, the agreement for the purchase of the necessary ground lot in Athens was signed in the name of the Watch Tower Society, and the building-erection works are expected to start shortly. The necessary expenditure—estimated at about $50,000—will be covered, as approved by the Society’s president, by funds borrowed from Greek brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also for our equipment for field service we feel thankful to Jehovah. With our small printing machine which, when “in good health”, prints hardly 1,000 copies per hour, we have printed during this year, in addition to 237,500 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, 20,000 booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth? </span><span class="font5">and 30,000 books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font5"> which we bound with a beautiful and attractive cover. Further we printed 307,000 of various forms, letterheads, and copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> and 250,000 copies of the four tracts released at the London, England, convention of 1951. Thus properly equipped with a variety of literature, we worked preaching the good news and had rich and blessed experiences despite persecution, arrests and imprisonments which involved 363 brothers this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a village of central Peloponnesus, a witness of Jehovah was arrested while at work and very cruelly mistreated at the instigation of religionists, and then was committed for trial. On learning of the event, his fellow villagers were shocked and were willing to sign a group protest against this unacceptable state of affairs, because they much esteem the brother for his good conduct. A 75-year-old man said: “I shall go as a defense witness at the trial to tell the truth. Though the distance is long, I shall take the pains of going even on foot, in order to tell what is true.” And, as a matter of fact, this old man did go up there to defend the brother! At the trial, the brother was discharged, but this irritated all the more the enemies of the truth and they reported the fact to the metropolitan of the district. When visiting that village later in order to “officiate”, he ordered the local gendarmes to bring him the witnesses of Jehovah living there. Carrying out the orders of this religious “authority”, these gendarmes found two witnesses of Jehovah and took them by force to the church. There the metropolitan interrupted the “mass” and demanded both of these villagers to receive the “holy communion”. They refused to do so, declaring that they were heterodox. The metropolitan then became infuriated, and started calling them “Hebrews”, beating them with his own hands in front of all the congregation and shouting: “I shall kill you; either you will die as Christians, or I shall not live.” The congregation was astonished at this rude behavior of the metropolitan, even at “mass” time, but the gendarmes in attendance allowed no one to open his mouth and say a single word. The result now is that a good company has been organized in that village, and ten publishers turn in their service reports regularly every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two young school girls made up their minds to work as pioneers during their school vacations. One of them, because her family traveled abroad, registered at the Society’s branch office and worked as a vacation pioneer. The other one worked as a pioneer with her mother, who is also a pioneer in Macedonia, and had very blessed experiences. “Every day,” she writes, &quot;we conduct two or three home Bible studies, and the people are very enthusiastic about the truth. In the home where we live, the housewife helps us much in the work, and it will not be long before she becomes a publisher too. She takes us to her relatives and acquaintances, and a very good witness is given them. As the housewife who extends us hospitality is very poor, we politely told her that we would leave, so as not to burden her any longer; but she would not let us go. ‘No,’ she said, ‘you are not to leave; do you alone want to be saved at Armageddon? You are to stay here and help me learn well Jehovah’s Word and be equally saved. You are still to dwell with us, and we shall eat together even bread and onions.’ Indeed, how much do the sheep hunger and thirst and require of us to feed them!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a town of Thessaly, a group of brothers who met together were arrested while studying their Bibles. An examination was held in the police section where they were taken. A sister was asked: “Who has made you a witness of Jehovah?” She answered the policemen at once: “You!” “We?” “Yes, you yourselves! By reading at times in the newspapers that you persecute and arrest Jehovah’s witnesses, I was spurred to learn who these people are and why you persecute them. But from such an investigation I became convinced that the truth is on their side, and I am now a witness of Jehovah too!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For a number of years now the work has gone on steadily in this country of Central America. We do not find an increase in number of publishers out in the work every month. There were five fewer during 1952 on the average than during 1951, there being 271 now. But the outstanding thing about the report is the maturity on the part of those who are working. These publishers have put in 10,000 more hours than did an equal number the previous year. They obtained more subscriptions, placed more magazines, made 3,000 more back-calls and conducted more home Bible studies every month. All of this speaks well of maturity and the proper training of the ones who are in the truth. The branch servant gives us an interesting report of what is going on and tells us how they have cleaned up the organization, removing those who do not appreciate the high standard that Jehovah sets for all Christians to follow. Excerpts from his report are set out herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the visit of Brother Siebenlist, an intensive drive began to clean the organization of all who did not appreciate the necessity of separating themselves from the moral standards of the “present system of things”. As a result there was a slight drop in number of publishers, but the organization has been greatly strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Puerto Barrios, a Seventh-Day Adventist Sundayschool teacher after studying with Jehovah’s witnesses for several months renounced his position as Sundayschool teacher and joined the local company. The minister is reported to have said, “Well, I rather expected it, but I didn’t think it would come this soon.” Many times the elders met to try to find scriptures to bolster their sagging belief in the trinity, and would wind up by saying, “No, we can’t use that. They [Jehovah’s witnesses] say this ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One missionary who was conducting a study with a man of good will discovered that the man was in turn studying with three other people back in the mountains. While Lutherans, Catholics, Quakers, Pentecostals and Adventists fight among themselves, they all join in the fight against Jehovah’s people. Tracts were distributed attacking the witnesses, only to be answered the next week when the witnesses used their own. The tracts are causing howls of religious rage all over Guatemala, where Bible truth is exposing moss-covered tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Zacapa, two missionaries in only eight months, with Jehovah’s aid, organized a nine-publisher company with an average of 14 hours a publisher and 100 per cent meeting attendance. Religious missions have been there for twenty years and at times have only a handful at their religious services. Little wonder the charge is heard, “Zacapa is filled with witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a lecture was given in Gual&amp;n in a large building in front of the Catholic church, the priests first tried to stop it by ringing the bell, but that did not keep 300 people from attending. So the ringing stopped. Next, the lights went out in the hall; but instead of causing confusion, a man on the front row mounted the platform, turned his flashlight on the speaker’s notes and the talk went on without interruption. A study was later started with this man, and it is hoped that soon he will be bearing another kind of light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Zacapa two elderly Quakers took it upon themselves to warn the people that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town. When one called on a friend of some twenty years’ standing, she said, “We simply must warn the people not to have anything to do with those Jehovah’s witnesses. As a Christian you will help us, won’t you?” Her friend looked surprised and said, “No! I’m one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An elderly Korean living at Uaxactun, in far northern Guatemala, obtained a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> while in the capital. Returning home, he began a careful study. Finally convinced it was the truth, he immediately saw the obligation of telling others. Though living in a town so isolated, the only contact with civilization being by plane once a week, he would throw a machete over his shoulder and tramp to the nearby chicle camps and offer the literature. As a result of his faithful work the message has penetrated to truly remote corners of the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the circuit servant visited this isolated brother he found two others ready to be baptized as a result of this brother’s work. Because there were no rivers or lakes, the baptism was done in the Pool of Paxaman, a water reservoir over a thousand years old when Columbus set foot on the Americas, built by the vanished Mayas to supply water for the ruined city nearby. The baptism was performed within sight of the ruins. The Mayan engineers never guessed that fifteen centuries later their reservoir would be used by Jehovah’s witnesses for the advance of true worship.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In this small republic in the Caribbean, Jehovah’s witnesses have organized seven companies. Jehovah’s servants will be very happy in learning that the little group of witnesses here has increased from 117 to 165 engaging in field service regularly every month. The year 1952 was outstanding for the Haitians, as there was a 41 per cent increase. For many years it looked as though nothing would happen in this country as far as gathering together a goodly number of other sheep, but in the last three years excellent progress has been made, with an increase of 36 per cent in 1951 and now 41 per cent in 1952. We sincerely hope and pray that the work will continue to move along at the same pace among the good people in Haiti, and we can see that those who are in the truth in Haiti are anxious to help them. This is indicated by the report sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When bringing newly interested persons to maturity, superstition and sometimes many useless customs have to be junked to make way for living in the New World society. Take, for example, common-law marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last April a man of good will started to publish. After several months of zealous activity he mentioned his desire to be immersed at the district assembly in August. However, it now came to light that he was living in common-law marriage with a mate by whom he had four children. So a mature publisher came along, and together we went to visit this brother and his mate. We all sat down together and had an earnest talk, pointing out that marriage should honor Jehovah’s name, that parents should want to give their children a good name and that we should lovingly consider our brothers who may, as a result, suffer reproach. Some objections were overcome. Then, as in nearly all the cases we have handled so far, there was a misunderstanding of just what marriage required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to custom, the ceremony had to be elaborate, with new extravagant costumes, veils, flowers, rings, etc., followed by an alcoholic reception and the couple had to have a house completely equipped with new furniture. All this required hundreds of dollars; so no wonder they were not legally married! This misconception was cleared up when we explained the bare legal requirements which called for birth certificates, three announcements of the wedding to the congregation and a slight legal expense of $2.10. The mature publisher, who was once in the same position, clinched the whole conversation by relating his own experience of how he legalized his marital union. Convinced that the issue so greatly affected his ministry, the new brother immediately fixed the date. We had a plain ceremony in the Kingdom Hall, and later he was immersed according to his desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Excellent work was done by the missionaries in blazing new trails out into the far corners of Haiti. In two weeks a couple bicycled 350 miles of mountainous, craggy roads, carrying bicycles and luggage through streams many times. An amazed soldier glanced at them saying, “You are real missionaries.&quot; On another occasion two of us climbed over 8,000 feet to the beautiful Pine Forest, and many on the way said, “That is the first bicycle to pass on that road.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was these out-of-town efforts that boosted the year’s total placements of books, booklets and magazines to a new peak. This seed will surely produce fruit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the ban was lifted last year, we have not had any more difficulty with the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again our service year was brought to a climax. Brother D. A. Adams, a representative from the president’s office, visited Haiti, and we featured his visit with a midweek district assembly. In preparation, over 30.000 handbills and 600 letters were distributed with the aid of brothers from isolated groups and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> our seven companies. The 246 attendance for the first evening exceeded the public meeting of the previous circuit assembly. The greatest number baptized at one time in Haiti made the immersion a happy event for all the brothers when twenty symbolized their dedication. Then came Thursday evening’s public talk. “World Unity Is It Just a Dream?” The hall was packed out and a third of the audience was accommodated by an outdoor speaker, giving us a record attendance of 600 who listened attentively to the theme as it was paraphrased into Haitian Creole. The majority were strangers, who gladly accepted 364 copies of a free French booklet The hall owner, thankful for the cleaning of the place, gave us the hall for an extra evening to hold our largest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study: 185 attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These all-time peaks were exceeded only by the August field service report, which revealed the best increase in any one month for Haiti. Twenty-three more publishers came into the field, bringing to a close a series of ten new peaks in the last thirteen months. Truly, Jehovah’s blessing manifest on the prisonerreleasing and maturity-building prompts us to extend our love and rejoice with our brothers all over the world in anticipation of what another year will bring.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The report as found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> is certainly a testimony to the peace and unity found in Jehovah’s theocratic organization. Here again in Hawaii we find the peace and joy of the brothers as they work together, saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.” Excellent progress has been made, and what the brothers have studied in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">during the year has helped them gain greater maturity. They are taking advantage of their freedom to preach. It is good to see the excellent increase from 428 regular publishers in 1951 grow to 550 publishers on the average every month in 1952, with a peak of 629. The brothers in Hawaii enjoyed a 29 per cent increase in number of publishers, and at the same time they made great advances in number of hours devoted to field service. They made nearly 12,000 more back-calls than during the previous year, and conducted nearly 200 more Bible studies every month. These 550 publishers are now conducting 877 Bible studies in the homes of the people. Some of the extracts from the report of the branch servant are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the 1951-52 service year it was suggested that maturity and not numbers be the goal toward which to strive. As one viewing the over-all picture here in Hawaii, I am very happy to report that maturity has been stressed and that positive results have been felt in better organization and co-operation among the brothers. Along with this increased maturity, there was a 29 per cent increase in number of publishers, with almost a steady increase from month to month until in August, the final month of the service year, when an all-time peak of 629 publishers was reached. This figure came close to reaching the potential shown by the Memorial attendance of the previous year. This year’s Memorial</span></p><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-7.png" alt="" style="width:235pt;height:125pt;">
<p><span class="font5">attendance was 1,021, setting a high mark for us to strive toward in the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Noteworthy too was the increase of over 32,000 in total hours over the previous year, another sure sign of maturity. Along with this it was found that the monthly average of home Bible studies conducted was 189 more each month than during the previous year—an increase of 27 per cent. Thus the command, “Feed my sheep,” is being taken seriously with grand results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To show that more are taking up fuller privileges of service, a peak of 52 pioneers was reached, including 10 vacation pioneers. A few more have arranged their affairs to pioneer on some of the outer islands where this help is needed, and possibly more can see their way clear to take up this grand service in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Worthy of attention were several companies that had outstanding service records during the year. Two of these more than doubled in number of publishers: another almost doubled in publishers and, due to increased transportation, reached an average of 26 hours and two Bible studies per publisher during the last month of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> has mentioned the need of working our business territory. We knew this had been neglected for quite some time in Honolulu, and so in September of last year a general call was issued for volunteers to try this feature of the service. The majority of the pioneers and some of the company publishers came to the special meeting for instructions from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> for launching this campaign. A survey had already been made of the downtown sections and assignments were given to organize this work. With one or two exceptions all went very well. Much literature was placed and several interesting experiences resulted. Many of the publishers found that working business was not as difficult as they had imagined, and some became very proficient at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the pioneers witnessed to the manager of one of the smaller department stores and then he suggested that she call later and talk to the salesgirls as a group, which she did. Sometimes a kindly reception is found where we least expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another pioneer contacted a businessman who especially liked </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> He readily gave the subscription for it and stated that if we ever published any more literature like that he wanted it. Regular back-calls disclosed he was reading every issue and saving some of the articles for future reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reports show that theocratic activity has not been at a standstill in Hawaii. Sincere thanks and praise are given to Jehovah for his undeserved kindness for holding the way open for further prisoners to be released.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Honduras have not been idle during the past service year. They have not withheld the truth from spiritual prisoners, but rather the good news of the Kingdom has been scattered throughout the country. Two years ago there were only seven companies organized, but they now have fourteen. This past year we find a 38 per cent increase in number of publishers. They have also reached out into a new field, for they are now broadcasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> programs using the series, “Things People Are Thinking About.” Many comments are made about this throughout the country. With 311 publishers now engaging regularly in the field service every month, the brothers look forward to a new year with joy and gladness. They are hopeful of greater increases. The branch servant writes a good report and some excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two persons from the mining section of San Juancito showed up one day at the tailor shop of a brother in Tegucigalpa, inquiring about the good news Jehovah’s servants were preaching. They wanted someone to come and teach them the Bible. They were invited that night to the Kingdom Hall, where they met more of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, after obtaining literature, returned home rejoicing that they had at last found what they had long been seeking. The tailor decided to go and visit this group later and was joined by three other publishers. They made the trip in a truck and spent three days in successful service. Twenty-three attended a public meeting and they were shown how they could continue a study weekly themselves. They have since written that they are having two meetings a week with good attendance. The tailor is now thinking of moving his shop there long enough to form the group into a company and then return to Tegucigalpa to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every month a sister from the capital travels to the south of the country to sell merchandise. She takes literature along to the various villages and reports many hours in the service with Bible studies and many experiences. The sheep she has found now wish to have a systematic study arrangement and eventually their own company. Just how the message should be adequately carried into the many Carib villages along the Mosquita Coast region worried a brother in that section of the country. He decided to do something about it. He saved his money, bought a boat and a motor for it and sound equipment. A Carib schoolteacher that he had brought into the truth and who speaks the native language decided on pioneering and joined this brother on these trips. In times past four publishers would start out to walk to one of these villages at 3 a.m., visit all the homes and return in the night. Now the small motor craft is seen plowing through the salty brine of the Caribbean waters carrying the equipment of the brothers. And at the close of the day the schoolteacher gives a discourse in the native language, with wonderful results. To visit all these scores of villages will take time, but as the field has now been opened up and as the natives relay the message to others, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness another great problem has been removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The four tracts published in both English and Spanish have been a great aid to us here in our ministerial activities. For example, by radio and press the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses were condemned by a local priest. The tract </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe? </span><span class="font5">countered the false accusations that we were worse than a plague of yellow fever spreading everywhere. Most persons expressed themselves favorably and were willing to listen to not just one side but both arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> stressed that the publishers spend one-half of all their service time in the house-to-house activity. So all the brothers are now organizing themselves to do group witnessing. The efforts of the brothers have been greatly blessed. New ones have been found, resulting in more back-calls and home Bible studies, and our service record averages improved greatly over last year. An outstanding experience happened in the house-to-house work when a young man was contacted and invited to a public meeting. He attended and a study was arranged with him. At the end of the month he attended the circuit assembly and was immersed. He is now a very mature publisher participating in all features of the service and is planning to enter the pioneer service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark198"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>HONG KONG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Every kind of religion is to be found in Hong Kong. When the Communists took over China, it seems that everyone who had to flee the country fled into Hong Kong. Denominations of all kinds have settled under British protection and have established new and elaborate buildings. The false religious organizations of Christendom have tried to attract the Chinese to their “divine healing”, musical shows, evangelistic troubadours and good entertainment of all kinds. But the crowds just drift from one church to another. If they had the truth from God’s Word, these religious organizations would make ministers out of those who come to their organizations; but they are not interested in that. They are interested merely in building up a sect. Jehovah’s witnesses, on the other hand, rejoice in the grand privilege of proclaiming the good news to all, and excellent progress has been made during the past year in releasing the prisoners in Hong Kong. It certainly is good to see the average number of publishers jump from 20 to 37 in a year, and to know that a new peak of 48 was reached. Jehovah’s witnesses are known throughout this peninsula, both in Kowloon and on the main island of Hong Kong. The branch servant gives us a good picture of what is going on there, and excerpts from his report appear here.</span></p><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-8.png" alt="" style="width:187pt;height:110pt;">
<p><span class="font5">A good barometer of progress is the attendance at Memorial. This year we celebrated our fourth since the arrival of the first Gilead graduates. A few months after arrival we saw 15 persons gathered together in our little room; next year we had to find a bigger place to house the 22 that came along. Then we transferred to our present Kingdom Hall and it overflowed with 91, ruling it out for future use for the Memorial; so this year we did not know where to go until we remembered that most large functions in the colony are held in the large hotels here. The manager of the biggest hotel in Kowloon had been favorably impressed with the staunch stand of Jehovah’s witnesses in central Europe and was happy to let us have one of the halls at a reduced rate. In this very pleasant setting we had our best gathering, a full house of 174. A better appreciation of the truth was reflected in that a reduced number partook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The joyful service of the Memorial season brought a new peak for Hong Kong; 46 publishers used the excellent weather conditions to do our semirural territory. Here we found a tight mass of dwellings which had mushroomed up in the last year or so because of the inrush of refugees from the mainland. Many of the persons visited spoke the northern dialects and were not poor—indeed many termed intellectuals were obliged to live higgledy-piggledy in illegal structures, because there was nowhere else to go. A large proportion of homes were opened to us and we could sit down and quietly converse. The people are unsure of the future; those who have money do not know what to do with it for the best. On the edge of this village, in a dark old farm hut a publisher was about to address an elderly man clothed in old-style Chinese dress when instead the publisher was greeted by the surprising statement, “Oh, you must be from the Watch Tower to come around like this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year we ventured into some of the most squalid of the squatter areas. Some we worked by group witnessing on Sunday afternoons and some by evening booklet distribution. Conditions are indescribable; you are constantly amazed that so many humans not only can exist but can bring forth and rear throngs of children in herring-barrel surroundings. By contrast, we were offering the latest Chinese booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitherto practically all our effort has been concentrated on the Kowloon side, which is a mainland peninsula, but this time we spread over onto the island of Hong Kong; and we now hope to see the Kingdom work take root there as more of the publishers become mature and take on greater responsibilities. Although the missionaries average about twenty studies apiece and the company publishers conducted on an average the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">goal of one</span><span class="font5"> study per publisher per month, yet we know there is plenty of scope for increase. This was amply proved by the vacation pioneers on both the Hong Kong and the Kowloon sides, because in the second month of their holiday service they had a total of 18 Bible studies among these three young workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancestor worship is the rule in practically every family, ranging from what is termed “respect”, as in a so-called Christian home where some dead father or mother has his or her picture prominently displayed and garnished with flowers or fruit, to a more rigorous enforcement, as in homes where on a parent’s birthday each child has to present himself and do an act of obeisance. At certain seasons the whole family will trek to the ancestral grave, usually on some open hillside, where candles are lit and food is offered to the dead. Then each member in turn will take up a position before the tomb and bow and gesture with the hands. Should one member be studying the truth, here is his testing time, for a refusal to participate greatly angers a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every family keeps a servant and very often it is a problem to reach the master or mistress, because the servant has to be careful as to who is allowed in. Sometimes we ask for the master, sometimes we just ask for someone who can read, but very often it is only by keeping up an incessant and positive course that curiosity gets the better of someone inside and out he comes. Then the witness can begin. A variety of contacts have been made: sons of former generals, men of considerable consequence in municipal affairs in bygone regimes, many doctors and teachers, a police inspector or two, businessmen, housewives, school children and servants—all have studied with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now our Kingdom Hall is too small and we wonder where to expand. Space is at a premium; every nook and cranny is occupied; even business premises are nothing more than dormitories at night. Five Bible studies are frequently conducted at the same time in the Kingdom Hall and missionary home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a helping hand to the Chinese people of today the Society is translating the latest books into Chinese. This is no small task when you remember that the writing and rewriting has all to be done by hand in characters. The languages too are very dissimilar and it is difficult to match expressions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark200"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Our brothers in Hungary, though living under very difficult circumstances, are determined to follow the pure course of worship. They are determined to fight on the side of Jehovah God for eternal peace. They are not interested in the affairs of this world. The Society does not have a branch organization in Hungary any more. In fact, the organization is dissolved cis far as the government is concerned. However, the brothers there will not refrain from studying Jehovah’s Word and preaching it, and neither will they refrain from assembling themselves together. Despite all the opposition brought to bear against his people, sending them to prison, and isolating them one from another, the work has moved ahead. The Society will not publish any figures, but we can say that there has been an increase in number of publishers in Hungary during the past year. A wonderful witness has been given, and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, the publishers will continue to gather together the Lord Jesus’ other sheep and promote true worship. Word that has come out of Hungary with travelers who have been there and who have met Jehovah’s witnesses gives us this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We owe it to the undeserved kindness of our allpowerful God that we are able to report to you about our activity during the past year. When we look back upon the past twelve months, we can say that it was a year full of battles. The true worshipers are constantly attacked by the representatives of false religion, which explains why our public activity is forbidden. Just as true worship continued in the cave of Adullam in olden times and in the catacombs, so today. Yes, in accordance with Isaiah’s word, many prisoners are being freed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries the Catholic religion has been the state religion in this country. The clergy acted arbitrarily and controlled the civil authorities, and for this reason the true worshipers had much to suffer. Now the churches are separated from the state. Religious affairs are dealt with by a state minister for religious matters to whom each minister of religion must apply for a permit. Since our brothers have no such permits, our company meetings are forbidden, with a very few exceptions. No law has been promulgated against our activity; rather the attacks are of a private nature. For instance, a family was assigned to move to another flat for the reason that two families of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be allowed to live in the same house. In another village the inhabitants were forbidden all contact with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present there are 500 brothers and sisters in confinement because of their faith, with sentences ranging from three to ten years. They are held in three work camps where the treatment they receive is better than behind prison walls. At the beginning of their imprisonment they were not allowed to work. But then a government decree was read to the brothers stating that Jehovah’s witnesses are not people who want to overthrow the state but that they are diligent workers and therefore they are authorized to work. Since then their condition has been much better, and the overseer speaks commendably of the brothers. In one of the work camps the Memorial was celebrated with 180 attending, among them one of the anointed. From another camp we received a service report covering the time from January to August, 1952, showing that 155 publishers worked 3,790 hours. Many fellow prisoners have accepted the truth, some of whom have been released and are now publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many families are in very difficult circumstances because the head of the family is in prison; so the other brothers help them. Others have lost their jobs because they want to keep themselves unspotted from the world. Considering all these things, we may say that we have been successful in our endeavors to serve Jehovah faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty brothers were sentenced and imprisoned for refusing military service. Soon other prisoners were brought in, and a few days later both the brothers and the other prisoners were assigned to building work. There the witnesses talked the truth during the day and in the evenings. It was easy because the other workers constantly asked questions. Among those witnessed to were soldiers and also the overseers who liked to hear the truth. They attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study of the brothers and often asked them to sing Kingdom songs. A frontier guard, a state employee and a state overseer showed love for our brothers. They even wished to work with them and sleep in their quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One showed real faith; so the brothers started a personal study with him. He said that he had always been a lover of truth. Under the former regime he had set his hope on the Socialists; so he was branded a Communist and persecuted. His uncle was bound to a horse and dragged around till he died and his aunt was incarcerated. First this man became a policeman, then a frontier guard, but they did not trust him because he was too honest! Due to some critical statements he made he was arrested and sentenced to ten months in prison, where he came to know Jehovah’s witnesses. He was very much discouraged and thought about committing suicide, but after a brief acquaintance with the brothers he gave up that intention and was glad to be with them in prison. They studied with him and gave him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and a Bible, and as his knowledge grew he started to preach. Several persons came to us through him. When he was released he immediately went to one of our groups, where he told how he learned the truth. Then he went home and handed his resignation to his church, and his mother and sister followed him in this. Then he symbolized his dedication through immersion. He is now a diligent minister in his village, where he is the first witness. The inhabitants are astonished about him because they had considered him an atheist. Now he invites people to his home and gives lectures; at the same time he continues to study and keeps in touch with us through correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because he learned the truth as a prisoner, he now says to the prisoners, “Go forth!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark202"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The general aim throughout the year in India has been to help those who are already associated with Jehovah’s organization grow to maturity. Even with this, we find an increase in number of publishers as well as a very good increase in number of hours devoted to field service. Quite a bit of help has been given to India by sending eleven more Gilead graduates into the country as missionaries. The year started with 21 but closed with 33 missionaries in the Indian field alone. A goodly number of people attended the Memorial, and out of the 834 who attended there should be many who will take up the preaching of the good news in due season. It has always been difficult to show the Indian people why it is so important to follow God’s word as set forth in the Bible, but Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preach the good news and worship Jehovah in holy array. The report sent in from the branch servant covers India, Ceylon and Iran. Excerpts from these reports appear herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two new missionary homes have been opened during the year, one early in the year at Delhi and the other only this last month at Ernakulam, in the far south. The chief obstacle that missionaries face on coming to India is the language problem. There is so much English spoken that they do not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font5"> to learn another language in order to get about, and in the larger cities there is usually a multitude of languages used, so that the missionaries are sometimes faced with the problem of deciding which one to learn. But all are now trying to learn in a systematic way the language most commonly used in their particular locality. One missionary has moved away from Bombay city to a rural town for the very purpose of living and working among people who speak just one Indian vernacular, in order that he may be in a better position to concentrate on that language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding feature of the year for us was your visit in January. It was a momentous occasion for all of us, and it stimulated activity everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following your visit some changes you arranged were made at the branch office. The office and printery staff was reduced and two members went into the pioneer work. One who was a graduate of Gilead went to a missionary home, and the other, a native Indian, enrolled as a special pioneer in his native state. This change has worked well. Now our small printing press handles all our job work as well as preparing new publications in Malayalam, while the Malayalam </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is being printed by an outside firm right on the spot where this language is spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experiences in the field have shown the same general state of indifference on the part of the majority of the people as is seen and expected in every other part of the earth, but there have been some outstanding evidences that the battle between the gods is shaping up to a final showdown, and that the Master of the harvest is dividing his people as wheat from chaff and rewarding those who have courage to stand firm on the side of the King of kings. Quite early in the year we had a circuit assembly in a town where a fanatically-minded political sect of the Hindus has its headquarters. A crowd led by loud-throated fanatics invaded the public meeting and made it impossible for the speaker to continue. These Hindus were incensed by some statements in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joy</span><span class="font5"> booklet about demon religion, and accused the speaker of speaking against their idols and temples, though in actual fact not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> word had been said by the speaker about anyone’s religion. A second attempt was made two weeks later to give the same public talk, and police protection was asked for and given. But the police were powerless to prevent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> repetition, as the same bunch of rowdies interfered with the public meeting and again it had to be abandoned. Local newspapers took up the case on the side of the troublemakers with the result that tremendous publicity was given to it all around the district. Many thousands got to know about the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> distorted way, of course, but it gave a grand fillip to the work and some began to inquire further about our message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Real progress still remains confined almost entirely to the nominally Christian section of the populace, but not without opposition. In Bandra, near Bombay city, where two sister pioneers were working in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a very poor </span><span class="font5">locality among people living in huts, they met with severe opposition from Roman Catholic priests. On one occasion </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Catholic priest who entered a hut where the sister was discussing the Bible with a man completely lost his temper, snatched some booklets out of the sister’s hand and tried to kick her. He tore the booklets to pieces and threatened violence, saying that these people were his flock. Neighbors quickly gathered around and children were induced to abuse the sister whenever she went near the place again. But she persisted and today the man in whose hut this scene took place is a regular publisher of the Kingdom truth. He had courage to stand firm for what he saw was the right thing. There is now a small group of seven or eight publishers from that little bunch of huts all rejoicing in the liberty they have gained through the truth. They were prisoners, but now they have “gone forth” from their Roman Catholic prison house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we turn now to the prospects of expanded service during the coming year we shall continue to grow into a more mature body of Christian ministers making known the name of Jehovah and his kingdom by Christ Jesus and aiding still more and more prisoners to “go forth” from their religious prison houses into the new world of freedom with security.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the island of Ceylon there is one organized company of publishers working. Aiding the local brothers are six Gilead missionaries. It is difficult to understand why more progress has not been made, for the pioneers have worked hard; but the fact remains that there has been no real progress. The local religion is Buddhism, and the Buddhist, on the whole, shows complete indifference toward the message of the Bible. The local Christian communities are divided principally between Tamilspeaking Roman Catholics who have migrated from southern India and the local resident Singhalese and Dutch “burghers” who are associated with the numerous Protestant sects. The brothers have the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> in Singhalese, as well as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joy</span><span class="font5"> booklet, but they have found difficulty in placing these with the people in any great quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers have devoted more time to field service and made more back-calls than in the previous year, but the numbers remain about the same. Many seem timid about accepting the responsibilities of field service and will not work alone. They must learn to grow up spiritually if they are to win through in the battle with demonistic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in India, the language difficulty has been an obstacle to the missionaries, but they are making some progress and devoting some time regularly each day to the study of Singhalese. During the year they acquired a much better and more convenient home, and now as I write this report there is news that two more from Gilead are about to join them. It is hoped that the coming year will see better progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAN</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font5">Iran has been and is a troubled country. Its oil is its material treasure and also its downfall; it has not lubricated nor supplied energy to its national machinery, and the people are in distress, material distress, and certainly famished for the hearing of the word of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is one lone publisher in Iran. He was doing quite well until the trouble arose over the nation’s nationalization of its oil industry, but since then he has done practically no Kingdom work. For a time we lost contact with him altogether because he had no settled abode. Now again he writes to us saying that his heart’s desire is to serve Jehovah, but he calls for help.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark206"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A branch office was established in Indonesia, and the expansion there has been very marked. The Kingdom message was preached in Indonesia as far back as 1931, but not much progress was made there until 1947, when ten publishers started house-to-house work again. A little over a year ago eight missionaries who had been trained at Gilead arrived in Indonesia, and during the past year six more took up service there, bringing the total to 14. As month after month went by new peaks were reached in number of publishers; and during the last month of the service year 116 witnesses of Jehovah were reporting field service. The 1951 service year showed an average of 34 publishers, whereas the 1952 service year showed 91 publishers in the field every month. This brings great joy to our hearts. We believe excellent advances will be made during the 1953 service year also, because there were 197 in attendance at the Memorial in 1952, and these persons are showing great interest. Some of the experiences sent in by the branch servant are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While visiting some isolated publishers on the island of Billiton the circuit servant met the minister of the Chinese Protestant Church, and this pastor invited the circuit servant to address the congregation. This he did, and the minister translated his lecture on new world blessings into Chinese. The minister was so impressed with the message that he took the circuit servant to speak to the other congregations on the island that he had care of. In all, the circuit servant gave six public lectures, to a total of 300 persons, with the minister translating all the talks into Chinese. The minister is now studying the literature of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the work in the past has been done on the island of Java, but now the message is spreading out into other places as well. There is much interest on the island of Sulawesi now. The company on the island at Manado had a peak of 21 publishers during the year. During this service year a start was made in preaching the Word in Borneo, now called Kalimantan. In January a person wrote in to the office from Balikpapan on the east coast of Kalimantan, saying that he had been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses in Holland and was anxious to do some preaching in Balikpapan. The circuit servant visited him in April and he and one of the persons he had been studying with accompanied the circuit servant in door-to-door work. Two months later they had two more working with them, making a total of four publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interesting experience concerns a young girl 19 years of age living in the city of Malang, some fifty miles from Surabaja. This girl corresponded with one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Holland, and from those letters and from a few visits she had with an elderly publisher in Surabaja she learned the truth and expressed a desire to begin preaching. This was before missionaries began working in Surabaja; so there was no one to go to Malang to help her. But she began witnessing to her friends and started a study with her younger sister. The rest of the family were not interested but the two sisters kept on studying. When missionaries were assigned to Surabaja they contacted these girls and the elder one began publishing almost immediately. Now she has two of her sisters publishing with her, and all three plan to be baptized at the district assembly in Surabaja next month. Some of the missionaries have been able to visit them once a month and help them, and since the missionaries have been visiting there the parents have also begun to study. The outstanding thing about this experience is that these girls began to publish by themselves after only one contact with the missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The progress of the work has not been without opposition, though. Some of the religious organizations have been particularly active in trying to counter and discredit the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of the clergy have given lectures against us, others have had special booklets printed against us, and others give their parishioners regular warnings at church services, telling their members not to listen to us. This has not prevented the honest-hearted ones from accepting the truth, though. One active member of a church began to study with one of the missionaries and soon recognized that what she was studying was the truth. She had formerly spent much of her time collecting money for the church and now she asked the minister to find someone else to do the job, as she intended to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. The minister asked her to continue in her job until he found someone else. She said she would continue till he got someone else, but that when she went to the homes of the members to get their donations she was going to tell them what</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">she had learned from her studies with the witnesses. Later the clergyman brought all the elders to visit her in an endeavor to get her back into the church, but she was able to show them where the Bible did not support their teachings.

<h2><a name="bookmark208"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is a great joy to see a better organization functioning in Italy. The brothers there have moved on toward maturity and are appreciating more than ever the wonderful privileges Jehovah has given them of witnessing for the King and the Kingdom. Again we see an excellent increase in the number of publishers engaging in field service in Italy, and there are prospects for wonderful increases in 1953. There were 3,485 who attended the Memorial in 1952 and, with the good service that Jehovah’s servants are performing in Italy, many of these will soon be associating with Jehovah’s people and worshiping God in holy array. The branch servant gives us a good picture of what has happened during the past service year, and he tells of the joys our brothers have experienced. Here are some excerpts from his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rome convention was the unforgettable event of the year. When it was announced that the president of the Society would preside at the assembly the Italian brothers determined to make great sacrifices to get there. The poverty in Italy makes it difficult for one to leave the country for an international convention. So, when Brother Knorr suggested that neighboring countries be invited to attend the Rome assembly, the response was excellent. There were about 700 or 800 delegates from England, Denmark, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and many other European countries. This made the Rome assembly an international convention that the Italian brothers will never forget. It was their first taste of the love and unity that exists among brothers who are of different nationalities and races. Now we can look forward to similarly blessed gatherings of Jehovah’s people in Italy as well as in other lands, and we know that greater efforts will be made by our brothers to attend future assemblies. The foreign delegates to the Rome assembly gave us a practical demonstration on how to support an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt our convention had some effect on the field service, because from December (the month of the assembly) to June we had seven peak months in succession, climaxing with the year’s peak of 2,036 publishers. A corresponding increase was realized in the “Eternal City”, where the local company grew from 36 to 50 publishers, and much new interest has been manifesting itself since the convention. The prospects for future progress are very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a circuit assembly an important city official, known as the praetor, attended the public meeting in a local theater. When some late arrivals appeared bent on creating a disturbance during the lecture, the city official turned around to give the troublemakers an angry look which convinced them that no interference would be tolerated. At the end of the meeting the praetor expressed his approval of the Bible talk and admitted that Bible lectures were just what Italy needed. He expected to be criticized by the bigoted element for having attended the meeting, but this did not seem to worry him. Here was a public official who was willing to stand up for what is right regardless of public opinion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The house-to-house work has caused us only a few legal problems, because the police for the most part are not anxious to use against us old Fascist laws that require a license for the distribution of literature. Maybe they are beginning to realize that Italy is now a republic with a new constitution which guarantees freedom on a greater scale than ever before. Also, the lawenforcing agencies are quite busy these days with the radical elements that continue to threaten the security of the present government. The following experience well illustrates how the police prefer not to give us any trouble. The branch servant was called down to the Rome police station and questioned regarding the activity of the Watch Tower. The police official at first argued that our work could not be done without legal authorization. Then, when it was shown that numerous court decisions had sustained our right to preach in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">private</span><span class="font5"> homes of the people without police permission, the official did admit that it was a matter that only the courts could decide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have had to fight a few court cases, however, and almost all of them were decided in our favor. In Trent, where the Hierarchy’s Council of Trent was held in the sixteenth century to counteract the effects of the Reformation, we had a conviction on a charge of distributing literature from house to house without a license. A prejudiced judge decided against us and compelled us to appeal to the Court of Cassation in Rome. The appeal has not been heard yet. A few months later a similar arrest was made in Trent and this time the court officials indicated that their attitude toward us had changed. The judge acquitted the brothers and thus established that he was not in harmony with the previous unfavorable decision. A good witness was given in the courtroom and a number of persons at the trial manifested interest in the work that Jehovah’s witnesses do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In concluding this annual report the Italian publishers and persons of good will want to express their heartfelt thanks to Jehovah and to his organization for the many good things they have received during the year. The twenty tons of used clothing that you arranged to have shipped to Italy were distributed among the needy pioneers and company publishers along with other persons of good will. This relief program sponsored by our American brothers merely provided further proof that Jehovah’s people love one another as members of the New World society. After the blessings of the international assembly in Rome and the visit from the president of the Society, and with the continuous flow of Bible literature that is being provided for us, we now have every reason to press on in freeing more prisoners. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we will keep on preaching until God’s opposers are no more. Thanks be to Jehovah for making this possible in Italy!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark210"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There appears to be no end to the gathering together of the other sheep on the island of Jamaica. Already a peak of 2,719 publishers for the Kingdom has been reached, with an average of 2,558 in the field service every month. Even the devastating hurricane which swept over the island did not cause them to slack their hands, and the average number of hours for company publishers is very good. In spite of all the trouble they had during the year, the average is 9.9. It brings joy to the hearts of all God’s servants to see the faithfulness of their fellow workers under stress and to see how they meet the obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable. This is Jehovah’s work and his servants are always anxious to do the bidding of their God. So in happiness we see our Jamaican brothers worshiping Jehovah in holy array. The branch servant gives us a very interesting report concerning what occurred during the year, and some excerpts are taken from his writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hurricane of one year ago failed to dampen the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses here although many were hard hit. The determination of the publishers to press on was increased in no small way by a grand gift of eleven tons of relief clothing donated by our brothers in the New York congregations and shipped to us by the Society. Within forty-eight hours of its arrival in Kingston volunteer workers from the Kingston company and Bethel home had reshipped the clothing to all companies for distribution to Jehovah’s witnesses and other deserving persons interested in Bible study. To this day New York fashions are in evidence at our Jamaican assemblies. A favorable impression was made upon the general public who actually saw the clothing distributed in their own district. A loving gesture indeed, for which scores of publishers expressed their appreciation both by letter and by Kingdom service during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the servants have learned more about taking the lead in field service. The value of this is clearly shown in the case of one company where on two occasions a group of publishers followed the company servant on a thirty-mile walk through the mountains outside Kingston, traversing paths passable only on foot and oftentimes five thousand feet above sea level, placing forty-eight bound books on one occasion and finishing the day with a public Bible talk attended by 150 persons. That same company had ten new peaks of publishers during the year. Mature leadership on the part of many servants helped in attaining island-wide peaks in March, April and June and in increasing the monthly magazine placements by an average of two thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Kingston has also been stimulated by the erection of a beautiful Kingdom Hall by the South unit. Although the hall was designed to seat 300, the opening talk was attended by 1,400 and in one month the number of publishers increased from 80 to 105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the entire island the work progresses. A circuit servant walked twelve miles to visit an isolated publisher. He advertised a public talk in the district for that evening with 35 handbills and had 75 attend, two for every handbill. One company averaging four publishers had 165 to hear the circuit servant’s talk, and another of 58 publishers had to get a better meeting place to accommodate their 400 visitors each Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Common-law marriage is not looked down upon in Jamaica, but many kindly disposed persons who study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses are seeing the necessity of conforming to new world standards on marriage and are coming in increasing numbers to the Society’s marriage officer to have their marriage legalized before engaging in active preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The finale to our year’s activity was a fine one. An island-wide assembly was served by Brother D. A. Adams from the Society’s headquarters at Brooklyn. The assembly advertising went on the streets at the same time that the local papers were carrying reports of Anglican opposition to the Kingston North unit’s application for permission to erect another Kingdom Hall. This may have been one reason why the Sunday morning attendance was in excess of our peak of publishers. For the public lecture that evening a record crowd of 6,000 persons attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such figures show that there is still plenty to do in Jamaica. Already many are discussing ways and means of getting to New York for the assembly next year. More than a score have submitted their names so far, and of these only two attended the 1950 assembly. Certainly 1953 looms as a bright year for Jehovah’s people and, by his undeserved kindness, the publishers here are determined to push the expansion of true religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark212"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As in every other nation, there are many obstacles that have to be overcome in the preaching </span><span class="font6">of the good news concerning the Theocracy. In Japan the obstacles are probably greater, because the people do not believe in Christianity. The big problem is to convince them that the Bible is God’s Word and that the truths contained in that Word of God are the things they should believe. It is good to see how Jehovah’s servants in Japan are pressing on undaunted as they aid those who will study to see the truth. To see the new publishers taking their stand at the side of the missionaries brings real joy and gladness to the hearts of all. By steady searching and with the continual preaching of the good news, the other sheep will be found. Again we find a very good increase in the number of publishers reporting regularly, and a peak for the year of 311 singing the good news. The branch servant tells us some interesting things that occurred during the past year, and a few of the items are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year past the aim of all the missionaries, circuit servant and company servants has been to aid the Japanese publishers to grow toward maturity, and to strengthen the company organizations. This effort was successful, as the results of the field service show. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Japanese has been the greatest factor in this spiritual growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1952 service year saw the first two circuit assemblies ever</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">held in Japan. The first was held in the “Pittsburgh of the Orient”, Osaka. Being the first, it</span></p><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-10.png" alt="" style="width:233pt;height:113pt;">
<p><span class="font5">had several problems, among which was the writing in intricate Chinese characters of 300 placards and posters to advertise the public meeting. Average attendance of publishers was 200 but 453 came to the public lecture, showing how well the advertising material had done its work. The second assembly was in the great international port-city of Kobe. This assembly showed in a very clear light the increased maturity of many of the local publishers. For instance: For the first time in Japan, many of the Japanese publishers opened their homes to accommodate the conventioners, and this resulted in a great blessing to all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a missionary group that came to Japan when they were evacuated from Korea because of the war, and they have given a splendid witness in Nagoya, so that now there is a very active company of 45 publishers. Their report contains some interesting experiences: “Although we desired to help the Japanese people, we found that teaching English, or even using English during a Bible study, was defeating our purpose to give real lasting help to those sincerely interested in the Bible in Japan. Some younger persons are really interested in the Bible, so we felt it would not be right to exclude all young people from studying with us. The best solution seemed to group all the younger ones each missionary had into one group. In that way sincere ones would not be denied the opportunity of learning the truth, and still time would not be lost with those only pretending interest in the Bible for the purpose of learning English conversation. Also the missionaries began to learn the language well enough to use it entirely, and so now have practically no studies using English. Also the missionaries began to concentrate more on starting studies with older persons and especially families. This has been decisive in stabilizing the company here more than any other one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One young man who is sickly lives in Gifu, about forty minutes by train from Nagoya, and does most of his preaching in that city. He has been sick for three months out of the ten he has been active in the service, undergoing two major operations. Yet now he is holding seven Bible studies and reporting fifty to sixty hours per month, and this without any of the missionaries accompanying him in the field. He comes to the missionary home several times a week for literature, for answers to his questions and for advice, and to learn what the offer is for the month. He attends meetings at the Kingdom Hall about four times a month despite the distance he must travel to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries at Kobe were among the first to come to Japan, and the following from the home servant’s report tells of their progress and experiences: “In the service, the main effort has been toward maturing the new publishers who have come forward and who have stuck with us during the last year or two. We feel that Jehovah has richly blessed this effort. Some of our finest Japanese publishers now tell us that it took them one and a half years of study before they became convinced of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is hard for the Japanese to break away from many of their ingrained religious traditions such as the New Year observance, but we point out that it is equally hard for westerners to break observances such as Christmas. This year many of our Japanese publishers really made the break, and showed splendid zeal for the service during the three days that had formerly been set aside for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Shogatsu</span><span class="font5"> festivities. Some of the Japanese traditions would be crippling to Christian growth if persisted in. For example, there is the ‘spoiling’ of children. The little ones are treated much as little gods until six years old or more. In Western countries, we are accustomed to see people in streetcars or trains give up their seats for women or elderly people. In Japan, it is the ladies and elderly people who surrender their seats for the young children! The Japanese publishers really appreciated the recent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Until now there has been much to do in the way of preparation for the work in Japan, obtaining missionary homes, preparing translations, printing and publishing the Japanese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> as well as translating and typesetting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> in Japanese. Now all this has been completed, and there are six missionary homes filled with 54 good active missionaries, and seven companies of about 250 maturing publishers associated with them. So, returning thanks to Jehovah for the past year’s work, we look forward to the year ahead with great expectations of much larger privileges of service and an extended witness, through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>TAIWAN (FORMOSA)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Every effort has been made during the year to help our brothers in Taiwan, and some progress has been made in this regard. We were finally successful in having a representative from Japan, a missionary graduate of Gilead, get into Taiwan and talk to some of our brothers. He did everything he could to represent our brothers before the authorities in Taiwan to try to obtain freedom of speech and worship for them but without success. Jehovah’s witnesses are denied the freedoms that other religions enjoy there. There appears to be no persecution against Catholic or Protestant organizations, but there is strong opposition to the worship of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Society’s representative was told, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses can believe their religion in their hearts, but they must not preach it and they must not meet together.’ Is that freedom? Even with all this opposition, upward of 4,000 persons of good will have met with Jehovah’s witnesses and studied the Bible. The work goes grandly on, and it is reported that 1,116 have been immersed during the year. A few excerpts from the report of the visiting brother are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year commenced with the release of two of the most active brothers from prison. One of them was placed under virtual house arrest for six months, but at the first opportunity he set out to make good his pioneer time, putting in 240 hours in one month. This brother, hardened by sixteen years of persecution and torture, is now the circuit servant. His example radiates zeal and joy to those around him. He says: “When there is no </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> we mourn; when </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> comes, we rejoice.” For nine months they mourned. Then it was possible to get through copies of all the Japanese-language issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">Their rejoicing overflowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year a representative from Japan visited the brothers. It was difficult to meet with all of them, due to the ban, but the organization was checked over, and companies were established in ten places. Meetings were divided into separate Japanese-language and Ami-language groups. Since only two fifths of the brothers are literate, those who read Japanese must go to great pains in explaining the truth clearly to those who speak only the Ami language, which has no written form. However, the truth goes “through the ears straight to the heart”, and for sheer joy of the message these humble brothers immediately go and preach it to others. The company publishers’ monthly average of 23.5 hours shows how zealously they do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost every evening the police visit the homes of some of the brothers and inquire whether a Bible study is in progress. Even private family studies are banned, and Bibles and Bible literature are confiscated. While Jehovah’s witnesses are denied all religious freedom, the Presbyterian religion is constructing new churches throughout the Ami district. The brothers believe there is a conspiracy through persecution to force them to flee to the comparative calm of these churches. Recently, the strange mixture of a clergyman, a policeman and a soldier visited the circuit servant’s wife with an invitation to attend a Presbyterian social gathering. Jehovah’s witnesses reply: No fellowship, social or otherwise, with modem Babylon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The police have been hounding the brothers on the grounds that they are not a registered religion, but every time Jehovah’s witnesses apply for registration they are turned back. A visit was therefore made to the head of the long-established Presbyterian mission, to inquire how that mission had gone about registering. This religious leader replied that the Presbyterians had not yet registered, but hoped to get around to it “soon”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever the outcome, Jehovah’s witnesses are not dismayed. No dictator can rob them of the ‘freedom wherewith Christ has made them free’. They keep right on studying, talking, preaching, increasing—all to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The branch office located in Beirut, Lebanon, has a large area of territory to look after. It is Moslem territory, but Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the good news of Christ’s kingdom. Sometimes they get a hearing ear, sometimes they get opposition, and sometimes they get put in jail for preaching the good news. But onward they go, faithfully proclaiming the truth which Jehovah decreed must be declared in these last days. All are joyful, busy and anxious to get the work done. There are quite a few missionaries in this territory. In Lebanon at the close of the year we had eleven Gilead graduates, four in Syria, six in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan; and all of them, along with the company publishers, are having very good experiences. The branch servant in Lebanon sends in a report for the following countries: Lebanon, Syria, Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan, Saudi Arabi and Kuwait. Excerpts from these reports follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With more sisters out in the field in all parts of Lebanon we are able to do </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> greater work among the Moslems. Sisters can gain entrance to a Moslem home where for a brother to do so would be impossible unless the master is at home. Undoubtedly due to this increase in activity we received a letter from a Moslem Moral Society insisting that we stop visiting Moslem homes. They were provoked into writing this letter not so much by us as they were by the “Christian” clergy, as their letter reveals. To quote them, “Some of the local Christians have accused you to us for propagating your propaganda in their midst and they asked us to help them in opposing you and stand with them against you. But we said to them we have no right to interfere or oppose as long as it is confined within the Christian society.” Then their letter complained that we had gone out of bounds by calling on Moslems, so for this reason they were compelled to write us. We answered in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> kind way stating that the message we brought to the people was one of comfort and hope, which all persons sorely needed in these days, including Moslems, that we were not seeking to hurt or harm anyone, but had love for all in that we call on the people with the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious heads have reason to be concerned; for many Moslems are listening to the truth, more than ever before, and in fact some are taking their stand for the Kingdom. One of the sisters started a study with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> young Moslem who progressed quite rapidly and was soon attending meetings. His job took him to another town, but he did not forget the truth. One evening after work he invited 17 of his fellow workers, both Moslems and Christians, to his room to discuss the truth. About 2 a.m. the foreman awoke and wanted to know what was going on. After explaining, they invited him to stay. Stay he did, and so did the others until </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5"> a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A company in northern Lebanon wrote in that some Moslems from a nearby solid-Moslem village walked all the way to their village, three miles distant, and wanted some of the witnesses to come over and see them, for they had many questions about “our way of worship”. Two mature brothers went and had a lengthy discussion with a large group of them. The result was that a number of them expressed belief in the ransom doctrine, which the Koran explicitly denies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young brother while en route to Beirut on a bus began conversing about the truth with the man sitting beside him. It so happened this man was a well-known Protestant preacher. He told the brother to quiet down and not talk so loud. But to the contrary the brother continued, and, as is the custom here, others began listening in and became interested. Finally they urged him to stand up in front of the bus and talk. So as the bus rolled along the brother delivered an impromptu public lecture to about forty. The talk lasted for almost one hour, much to the chagrin of the preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not unusual in some of the villages that while the brothers are witnessing opposition is stirred up by the clergy and hundreds of people gather. At one place a priest came to the home where a brother was witnessing and demanded that he leave. Since the owner of the home said nothing either way, the brother refused. The priest shouted angry words at the brother. The brother held his ground, and the people began gathering. As the witness kept referring and pointing to the Bible, the priest in exasperation shouted, “The Bible should be destroyed.” At that the brother held aloft the Bible to all the crowd and in a loud voice said to them, “Did you hear what the priest said? He said the Holy Bible, God’s Word, should be destroyed.” This was real evidence showing the faithlessness of the clergy to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We want to mention too before closing how happy we were to have Brothers Knorr and Henschel with us for a few short days. We had a very successful convention, using the Assembly Hall of the American University of Beirut. We put on a vigorous advertising campaign, distributing thousands of handbills. We were thrilled to have nearly 800 in attendance, almost half of them persons of good will!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF THE JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The 1952 service year was one of continued progress in the Jordan. From the beginning of the year speedy growth was noted from the handful of publishers there. The sheep were being located. Real impetus was given to the work by the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel in December, and during that month a new peak of 27 publishers reported time in field service. Meeting attendance during their visit showed a much greater potentiality of publishers who had the urge to take seriously the admonition to ‘release the prisoners’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each month saw a new peak in number of publishers, and even for the last month of the service year a new all-time peak was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is common in the East, the women are somewhat suppressed in their activity; nevertheless, several sisters have dedicated themselves and symbolized this by water immersion. This year a total of 17 persons have been baptized in the famous Jordan river near the location where John instituted baptism among the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year a special pioneer was assigned to Jerusalem, and now a combined total of 105 persons attend at eight Bible studies. Out of this arrangement eight publishers are reporting time, and as soon as a suitable meeting hall can be rented a company will be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Ramallah one of the missionaries was weighing himself on scales in the drugstore when a young Arab assisted him. He asked why the missionaries had come to the Jordan; and after our mission was explained, he accompanied the brother to the missionary home where they had a Bible study. Now the young man goes with the brother and his wife on many of their studies to interpret for them. He also joined the ministry school and became a publisher the first month. This new brother had an excellent opportunity for being a vacation pioneer during this summer, since he is a schoolteacher, and he quickly took advantage of the prospect. Another man who operates a coffee shop was contacted at his place of business, and he admitted having associated with the brothers back in 1918 but that he had fallen by the wayside of inactivity. A back-call was arranged for, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> study started, and now this brother is a regular publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Protest meetings by various religious clergy were held in Bethlehem and Jericho for the admitted purpose, ‘to stop Jehovah’s witnesses, and save our Christianity.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother residing in Amman was contacted and visited. Much zeal was manifested by him and now, due to his witnessing, eight publishers report time spent in preaching. These people in the Jordan have the faculty of being quick to agree or disagree with the message. All the publishers report that it is not unusual for a new person to begin preaching after the first study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Arabic people have a yearning for knowledge and are very curious by nature; so it is not unusual for 15 to 20 persons to attend one study. A Moslem man came to one brother’s house asking for proof for the trinity, but instead of getting proof for that doctrine Scriptural proof against it was given. Then the man stayed for a study which resulted in another publisher for the good news. A study was started with a family of seven, and within two months three were reporting time spent in preaching. One has been baptized, and members of this family now hold several studies of their own. Mature brothers to conduct the meetings are scarce, especially for the company meetings; so it is interesting to see these new ones studying diligently and trying their best to apply their new-found knowledge so they can instruct others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Though we had a fine increase in Syria, this did not come without opposition and persecution. The brothers were continually harassed on every side by politicians, the clergy and their dupes. When this new regime took over, all political parties were placed under ban. At one of the villages where there is a fairly large company the military authorities came to close the meeting place of a local political party and put a seal on the door. Some of the members of this political party who opposed Jehovah’s witnesses asked them: “Are you not going to close up the meeting place of Jehovah’s witnesses as well?” The officials answered: “We have orders to close all political meeting places. As for Jehovah’s witnesses, we have no orders concerning them.” At this the adherents to the political party were enraged and began a campaign of persecution. They would surround the Kingdom Hall during meetings and shower it with stones, some of which came through the windows and doors, until it became quite dangerous to have meetings after dark. The brothers were obliged to meet during daylight hours. Even then as they would walk to their homes some of the mobsters would try to catch them alone to beat them. One brother was even shot at as he walked along the street. Finally some of the frustrated ones brought a case against the servants of the company, accusing them of causing division, strife and hatred among the various religions by their preaching. This case was settled, but new ones were started immediately by the opposers. These cases are still pending, but through them a great witness is being given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer brother was arrested and placed in prison with the worst kind of criminals, among them even murderers. It was some time before the police would even say why they had arrested him, but eventually they accused him of being paid by a foreign society to spread Jewish propaganda. However, they still refused to set a date for trial and would not let him out on bail. He languished in prison six weeks under terrible conditions, with the brothers bringing him food from the outside. He was not idle, however, but gave a good witness among the inmates and was able to find some interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several influential lawyers of the city were contacted but they were unable to get the authorities to set a date for trial. Finally a Moslem sheik (priest) heard of the situation and, being favorably disposed to the truth, decided to find out for himself why the pioneer was being kept in prison. Since this sheik was a well-known and respected man in the city, the police were quite impressed by his inquiring about the brother. He was told the reason for his being held was that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This they thought would please the sheik. To the contrary, he answered: &quot;Well, if that is the only crime he has committed, then put me in prison also, for I too am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” A+ this the brother was released and a date set for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the trial a splendid witness was given. The lawyer was a Moslem, as were all attending, so when he spoke so well of us they were willing to listen. We are not political, not pro-Jewish; we are neutral, believe in the Bible and preach only that. The pioneer brother was released immediately and now has the freedom to preach without being molested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not all attempts at persecution are so difficult to defeat, however. One of our brothers was working with the literature when he was accosted by a passing soldier. The soldier contended that these books were not permitted in Syria and trundled the brother off to his superior officer. The brother proved that the books were permitted, gave a good witness, placed a book with the officer, and walked out of the station, much to the consternation of the soldier making the arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though it has been a fight, the past service year has been a blessed one for Syria; and we pray that more freedom to preach may come that even a greater witness may be given.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>SAUDI ARABIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is the first year we have been able to get a report from Saudi Arabia. Two publishers from Lebanon went to work in a hospital in the city of Jeddeh, the sister as a nurse and the brother as a chemist. The brother does much preaching during his hours of employment. Due to circumstances there this is the only time he is able to preach, and since he is a man he is unable to call on the solid Moslem community there. Saudi Arabia is very strict about its religion and does not want anyone bringing anything different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sister talks the truth in some of the homes that she visits while she is working. The brother placed a book with a man from Mecca, religious capital and stronghold of Islam, where it is said Christians are not allowed; so we see the truth is even seeping into Mecca, birthplace of Mohammed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KUWAIT</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark221"></a><span class="font5">Kuwait is a tiny country on the Persian Gulf known as a sheikdom, because it is ruled by a sheik or Arab prince. One brother from Lebanon went to work with an oil contracting company there and started to publish. He was able to distribute some literature and even conduct a Bible study. The inhabitants are Moslems except for those who work for the oil companies. Most of the natives are illiterate, although recently they have been starting schools and going in for education of the young. Even though it is very hot and the country mostly desert, this one lone brother has endeavored to hold high the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For a number of years now Mexico has been growing very rapidly, but this year there was a little slowdown as far as an increase in publishers is concerned. There was a good increase, namely, 7 per cent on the average, in the number of publishers going out in the field service every month. But a cleansing work took place in Mexico, and it has had a very wholesome effect. Many are the comments to this effect by strangers: “I know many organizations that claim to be Christian, but they do not do to their people what you are doing to yours. Jehovah’s witnesses are different. You practice what you preach.” These comments are due to the fact that many persons were disfellow-shiped during the year because they would not line up with Jehovah’s Word on keeping the organization clean. They would rather carry on their wicked practices and live immoral lives in commonlaw marriage. Some very interesting things happened in Mexico during the year, but we will let the branch servant tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For several years the Mexican branch has maintained and conducted reading and writing classes in many Kingdom Halls throughout the country with much success; but this year, because of the many new persons associated with the organization who do not know how to read or write or who know very little, these classes were started again, with 4,500 persons enrolled up to the month of August. We hope that these persons, as many have done in the past, will learn to read and write within this service year. We believe that most of them will, because they really have the desire to learn and because the teachers, most of whom are company servants and pioneers and some of whom are regular schoolteachers, are doing all they can to help them. Some of those who learned to read and write two or three years ago are now good speakers, able to deliver one-hour talks and to take part in the circuit assemblies. The good results obtained by means of the reading and writing classes are reflected in the increased number of public talks given. In the service year of 1951 the total number of talks given throughout the republic was 2,906; whereas for this service year the total number of talks is 4,005.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In many isolated towns and villages as soon as the priests know that the witnesses are there they ring the bells and tell the people that tares are being sowed in their midst and that they have to be gathered and burnt, inviting the people to mob the witnesses and afterward to gather all the literature and burn it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one small town about a hundred miles from Mexico City a group of persons of good will were studying </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> by themselves in their own home when a mob went to them and took two of the men and put them in jail. When their wives took them food and the other witnesses went to see them, they also were put in jail until the number reached 15, including a two-year-old baby and a thirteen-year-old girl and other young boys and girls. A few days later they were taken to another jail, but before arriving at that jail they were stoned and beaten unmercifully until some were covered with blood. Without having a trial, a hearing or a chance to defend themselves, the witnesses and persons of good will were formally put in jail. The charges were that they were threatening to burn the Catholic church and murder the local priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It took time before the case could be brought up to the state capital, where the authorities are not controlled by the Catholic Hierarchy as in many of the small towns. There the witnesses were cleared of the false charges and were given their freedom after spending three and a half months in a filthy jail. Before being released one of them died in jail, another died a few days after being released, and nine others were seriously sick for several weeks. As sick as they were, most of them could not return to their own homes because of the evil threats made against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those Catholic “Christians”, as they call themselves, are so fanatical that not only do they make threats but they carry them out. A few days after being released from jail one of the brothers was visiting some persons of good will in their home when a mob took nim and unmercifully beat him with their sharp-edge machetes until he was unconscious, but the man of good will he was visiting took the risk of protecting him. When this brother was taken to the hospital several wounds were found on his body and one big cut of about five inches across his head. This brother, along with all the others, is standing firm, not yielding to the desire of the fanatics who want to force him to return to the Catholic Church. The firm stand of the brothers is causing many persons of good will to identify themselves on the side of righteousness. Already more than one hundred of them want to leave that modern Sodom and Gomorrah and move to another town where they can exercise the freedom that the Mexican Constitution guarantees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to have a good, clean organization, in the month of February all companies and pioneers were instructed that every couple in the organization who were living together as man and wife had to be legally married by the end of June and that after that date those not having legalized their marriages would not be counted as publishers. It was a joy to see how the brothers responded, making the necessary arrangements to legalize their marriages. In some companies groups of twenty couples and even more got together and were married at the same time. But those who were in the organization for selfish motives separated themselves from Jehovah’s witnesses or were disfellow-shiped, leaving a clean organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So with a clean organization, with those that were causing divisions in it and those corrupting it with their immoral conduct disfellowshiped, and with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">hope that those 4,500 enrolled in the reading and writing classes learn to read and write soon, we are entering the new service year joyful in the hope that the activities in the past service year will open the way for greater activity in the future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The country of windmills and tulips, dikes and canals sends in a very interesting report. Many of the people in the Netherlands are leaving their barren religious fields and turning to the truth. They Eire finding food convenient. The modest Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses are steadily being increased in size in order to accommodate the great crowd that is associating with Jehovah’s people in this little land. Again our brothers in the Netherlands have had a good increase, with 7,040 on the average every month. This is nearly a 10 per cent increase over the previous year. They reached a good peak of 7,272 publishers. The work in this country has not moved along without opposition, but in spite of the persecution from the false religious crowds, Jehovah’s witnesses have stood firm and the eyes of many of the people have been opened. The branch servant nicely covers the work that has been accomplished, and a few excerpts are taken from his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine Day was a feature of the work which needed much attention and still does. For the fall series of circuit assemblies we suggested to the circuit servants a service meeting with Magazine Day as the final theme. This meeting was used by the assemblies and proved to be a boost to the work. December began the special effort to be put forth during magazine days according to counsel given. More house-to-house work was urged and the brothers were encouraged to use their Saturday evenings to go from house to house with the magazines. During this one month the placements rose 127 per cent. During the service year we placed 294,564 magazines, to compare with 140,908 in the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year came the good news that isolated territories were to be worked. Many interesting experiences were reported, and in writing this report it is difficult to make the selection. An interesting one comes from a brother who, after working in a village 90 per cent Catholic, came together with his group for lunch. As they were missing two of their number, he went to look for them and soon spotted the home where they were. His report continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;I was welcomed at the door by a friendly woman who said, ‘Come on in quickly; there are two of your fellow workers here. I am so happy to get acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses again. I saw you go by and asked my husband: “Could they be Jehovah’s witnesses?” ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When she had learned that there were more of us outside, she said: ‘Oh, come here, all of you, I will set the coffeepot for a cup of coffee.’ We did that and then listened to her story. She had come in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses earlier, but due to circumstances this contact was broken. However, she could not forget the things she had then heard, and she continually longed to see one of the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before we left we invited her out for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study which was to be held at three o’clock that afternoon. She even made arrangements that we could meet in a small hall; she was happy to be present. She listened attentively along with her children to the study which dealt with training children for life in the new world. After the study ended she subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> In the evening, when we turned homeward, she stood in front of her house and heartily waved us farewell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the legal front opposition has dwindled, seemingly due to stinging rebukes by the supreme court in previous years. There are those, however, who never seem to learn. In the city of Deventer, an article in the local police regulations prohibited one to audibly present a magazine for “sale”. A brother was arrested for doing so on the street. In defense the brother argued that to audibly present the magazine was a part of the normal presentation. The local judge did not agree, and found the brother guilty. The case was appealed to the highest court of the land and the justice of this court quashed this decision and declared the bylaw invalid on grounds that it was unconstitutional. Frontpage news of this event in the country’s leading papers was headed with statements like: “Jehovah’s witnesses again proved right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last May, in the city of Venlo, baser methods were used to try to prevent a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. Stirred to action by the preassembly activities, the clergy put pressure on the owner of the hall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses had engaged and forced him to break the contract. Both the clergy and the press harassed the rooming work. In the meantime a tent had been rented, a plot of land obtained and the preparations for the assembly went on. As the day for the opening sessions of the assembly drew near, the man who</span></p>
<div><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-11.png" alt="" style="width:49pt;height:61pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">had agreed to cook the food for ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the assembly broke his agreement; the swimming pool for the immersion was canceled, and other similar tactics were used. Warnings not to have anything to do with the witnesses were placed in bold type on the front page of the leading newspaper. But all this opposition did not give the enemy much comfort and assurance. They knew that many people of Venlo would attend the public meeting on Sunday. They stooped still lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pressure was put on the burgomaster who by letter declared the public meeting a closed meeting; none of the public could enter. About one hour before the talk was to begin the police stepped in, closed all entrances to the tent except one, and here denied entrance to everyone who could not prove that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the meantime, outside the tent, a mob of about 1,000 had gathered, some interested persons, but mostly hoodlums who had come to cause trouble. Inside the tent, surrounded by a cordon of about 60 policemen, the talk began on time. Outside, the mob broke into a roar with the intention of drowning out the speaker. The mob demanded that the amplifier be turned off, and the police cringing before the demands of these hoodlums had the sound system turned off. The damage that the Hierarchy did here soon boom-eranged tenfold as many papers country-wide took up the fight in favor of decency and justice and gave the Hierarchy a sound lashing. Their own commentators admitted that such weapons of violence and force are most ineffective against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We look forward to the crowning event of 1953, the world assembly at the Yankee Stadium. We are determined to make 1953 our greatest year of activity yet, and then, with our delegation of representatives, assemble with our brothers from all parts of the globe at this feast and relate to one another the grand things Jehovah has done for us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Netherlands West Indies is a small group of islands and does not have any isolated territory. However, the brothers have concentrated on the matter of bringing the publishers to maturity. In this they have had good success. A 25 per cent increase in average number of publishers was reached, with a fine peak of 215 praisers of Jehovah. The brothers in the Netherlands West Indies are very much interested in obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and distributing magazines. The branch servant writes much about their success in this regard, and Jehovah’s witnesses in these islands certainly have enjoyed this success. Excerpts from the report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One lady with whom a study is being conducted has a grocery store; so one week it was suggested that she take some magazines to place with her customers. She took ten, and when the publisher called the next week the lady had placed all the magazines and obtained two new subscriptions. Since that time she has kept magazines on display in her shop and was able to place six magazines at one time one day when a group of immigrants (from England on their way to Australia) stopped in to buy bananas and saw the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another lady of good will places magazines by pinning them on a line across her shop with clothespins, in the same fashion that other shops display lottery tickets. She also obtains subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interesting case of making opportunities is that of a live-wire Dutch sister who is a nurse in a big hospital here. Many of her patients are sailors; so she places magazines with them while they are convalescing, and many times they like the magazines so much that they give subscriptions before leaving the hospital. There is a large fleet of tankers hauling crude oil from Venezuela to Curacao and Aruba, and many of the sailors on these tankers like to have the magazines to read while they are at sea. Unlike many sailors, it is very practical for them to have subscriptions because they come into port every three days, so they are able to get their magazines regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we have been very fortunate in obtaining renewal subscriptions. When one missionary called on a prison guard to get his renewal, he asked the guard if they had a library in the prison. He said yes and that if the publisher liked he could call at the prison at a certain time and the guard would introduce him to the warden to see if some books could be placed for the prison library. This was done and the warden was very much pleased when he was shown the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on “Renewing the Mind”. He thought something like that would be good for the inmates and asked how it could be obtained regularly. The subscription arrangement was explained; so the warden took subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> in Holland-ish, English and Spanish—six new subscriptions at one time because, as the warden explained, he has a very “international crowd” in his prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have just finished a wonderful year of service, thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. At the time of this writing many of the friends here are busy devising ways and means to get to the New York assembly in 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWFOUNDLAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font6">Newfoundland used to be unassigned territory. There were only a few publishers in St. John’s and one or two other towns, but now we find Jehovah’s witnesses pretty well scattered throughout the territory, with 22 companies organized. The mild-tempered ones are sighing and crying because of the abominations done in the world, and they are seeking the truth. Public meetings have been very successful in this country, and a number of excerpts have been taken from the branch servant’s report showing what has been accomplished in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1952 service year got off to a fine start with an inspiring district assembly at St. John’s. We were privileged to have Brothers Franz and Hannan from Brooklyn Bethel serve us at this spiritual feast. Newfoundland was the last stop on their way home from European conventions, and so we received the “cream” of all of them from these dear brothers. This was very encouraging to us here, many having made great sacrifices to get to St. John’s at that time. But the blessings were abundant, for Brother Franz delivered a talk that was to set the theme for the next twelve months, “Say to the Prisoners, Go Forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">January started off the most successful </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">campaign ever held here. From the very beginning all the companies were conscious of getting new subscriptions. Some of these were obtained from friends and relatives, from back-calls and on the streets; but by far the majority were taken in the regular door-to-door work. Many and varied were the experiences had by the publishers in getting these subscriptions. One brother whose secular work keeps him busy underground in iron mines seven days a week brought up the subject of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions while taking a rest period. The result—eight subscriptions were obtained at one time and the brother did not even have a copy of the magazine with him! This publisher ended the four months’ campaign with a total of twenty-two subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On one Magazine Day in St. John’s the missionaries placed more than 300 magazines. A woman approached one of the brothers on the street and asked for the latest issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> The brother informed her he had just placed his last copy, whereupon the woman pulled out a dollar and said, “Well, I guess I’ll just have to subscribe!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionary boat “Hope” has spent the summer months working across the south shore of the island. This is very isolated territory with many little outports dotted along the rugged coast. The Gilead graduates would pull into a harbor and then visit all the homes, placing literature and inviting the people to attend a public meeting on the wharf. So anxious were the “liviers” to hear the truth that they would gladly stand on the wharf for an hour or more listening to the lifegiving message. How they appreciated the truths they learned and the literature they received! One woman, having already received two books, requested a Bible after the talk, saying: “This will be like a remembrance of the good work you boys did here in our little village.” On one occasion a man who was visiting from another village told the missionaries to be sure not to miss Harbor Mille, as the people were anxious to have them come there. Would they really be waiting? Practically the whole village responded to the message! Truly the public meeting work accomplished by the missionaries on the south coast stands as living testimony that it is not always necessary to have public meetings in buildings to ensure their success, for in some places the whole village turned out to hear the Bible discourse at the seashore. (Mark 2:13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> At one outport of about 100 homes, 130 persons stood on the wharf and listened intently to the talk. Results similar to this were achieved in village after village and outport after outport. The report to the branch office for one month revealed that over 1,000 attended the 21 lectures that were held, and more than 1,000 bound books were left with the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1952 found a steady growth of the work in New Zealand. Although the 14 per cent increase in number of publishers was not equal to the 22 per cent increase of 1951, the results are very good. The new publishers made a real advance toward maturity. With the spiritual food coming forth in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and the publishers attending the local studies, the service meetings and the ministry course, why should there not be great maturity? The branch servant expresses himself in regard to the joys of service they are having and tells about a few experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although at present conditions here are comparatively peaceful, the publishers find real interest and have many enjoyable experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ships from many lands come to this territory and good work is done in some ports in witnessing to seamen. One brother contacted a colored member of the crew of a Dutch vessel who showed much interest. He was supplied with the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and a Bible, and a back-call was arranged for the next day. The man proved to be very teachable, and after a further study he wanted to be baptized. The chapter “Dedication to God—the Way to Life” was covered, and in all four studies were conducted with him before his ship sailed. He was furnished with the address of the branch in his home town, Freetown, Sierra Leone; and he has decided to be baptized there when he returns after the present trip. He declares that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> has convinced him that the religious body he formerly associated with has not taught him the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Opposition does not always spell “goat”, although the man of one house had resisted the truth bitterly for four years, so much so that his wife found it difficult to get in her studies and study material. Determined to sever his wife’s connection with Jehovah’s witnesses the husband moved from place to place, but each time the witnesses located the wife in her new home and again started studies with her when he was not around to order them out. This he would do in no uncertain terms If ever they called while he was home. One day when he was in the forest cutting timber, a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriber with whom he was working talked to him about God’s kingdom as the only hope of mankind and this seemed to make an impression on the husband. After a few weeks he returned to his home and immediately asked his wife for some of the Watch Tower publications. He began reading with interest and soon allowed the witnesses to enter his home, where he asked many questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little later a circuit assembly was held in the vicinity, and he decided to attend. On his way to the assembly he was a little worried as to how the witnesses would react to his being in their midst, and wondered if they would forgive his past rude behavior. When he arrived at the assembly, the first one he met was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">zealous sister whom he had ordered out of his home and whom he remembered well. Immediately upon seeing him this sister rushed up to him and gave him a very hearty welcome, saying: “Ah! you are with us at last.” After this greeting the husband turned to his wife and said: “Well, if they are all like that, this is going to be easy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the circuit servant visited the company with which he was associated, this man was immersed and is now saying to other prisoners, “Go forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new service year is under way and we start out with a fresh round of circuit assemblies almost immediately. A further pleasant prospect is the campaign in unassigned territory, delayed In this part of the world until the longer days of summer, during December, January and February. The outlook is thrilling and we look forward to a year of blessed service during 1953.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark227"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is sometimes very difficult to pull away from this old system of things and line oneself up with the true worship of the Most High God. However, many of our brothers in Nicaragua are doing just that even though it is sometimes very difficult for them to straighten out their lives to conform to theocratic standards. As is true in many Central American states where the Catholic religion has dominated, immorality is prevalent. The sanctity of marriage is not observed. Our fellow workers in Nicaragua have seen fit to make changes in their marital status because Jehovah’s witnesses have, through their publications, pointed out the proper and Scriptural course to take. The branch servant indicates that the theme for the 1952 service year seems to have been clean worship, and his report on this big problem is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the 1952 service year many points were cleared up as to clean worship in Jehovah’s organization. Many of the people of good will who had accepted the truth and who were publishing it still were shackled by moral irregularities in their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those that took steps to legalize their marriages or other steps to cleanse themselves have been greatly blessed. One brother has been studying and attempting to work in the field for many years. His difficulties at home and other problems, along with the knowledge that he was living in fornication, weighed heavily on his mind to the point where he was almost ready to quit. His family life was a failure, but he held on in order to support his three children. Then he was helped to see how to remedy the situation: marry, legalize his children, relieve his mind of the thoughts that resulted from his trying to serve Jehovah improperly. After several weeks of arranging his affairs and saving money, he brought the proper officials to the home and legal papers were drawn up and the marriage registered. From then on he was a different person, with more zeal, a happy face, and problems at home began to straighten out; and today he is one of the best publishers. Why? Because he is clean and he knows it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A much more zealous publisher was produced in another case also, where a sister was living with a man not in the truth. When she could finally make him see the need for marrying and the marriage was arranged her hours and service results increased wonderfully. And why not? When Jehovah’s spirit is restrained by wrong living, why could it not flow again if we make a sincere effort and carry to a conclusion our purpose of worshiping him in cleanliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another brother in a small company was cut off the publisher list because he was living improperly. He was complaining of family troubles: five children to feed, a woman that he had lived with for several years who would not accept the truth and a mother-inlaw who insisted on images in his house. Did he become offended when his improper service was brought to his attention? No, he made a real effort to straighten it out. His proposal of marriage and straightening out so moved his “wife” that she consented. She has since accepted the truth, been baptized, and shows as much zeal as her husband. The mother-in-law could not stand it any more and moved to another town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These many wonderful experiences show how unwise the many others are who, through selfishness or laziness or fear, refuse to do anything about their situation or put it off for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">manana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A missionary was studying with the wife of a policeman, who, due to the acute housing situation, was obliged to move into a part of the jail. Soon some of the prisoners joined the study. One who was a Baptist began to raise arguments in favor of the trinity, hellfire and other doctrines. After examining a few Scripture texts he saw the ridiculousness of these demoninspired ideas and the reasonableness of the Bible. He admitted that he had been a Baptist for twenty-eight years but had learned more about the Bible in two weeks with Jehovah’s witnesses than in all that time with the Baptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The end of the year finds Nicaragua with fewer publishers than before, but with better publishers. We earnestly desire that they will continue to grow in maturity and reflect it among the other people of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Looking back over the past service year in Nigeria, we find that Jehovah’s witnesses in that land are very happy and continue to say to the prisoners, “Go forth.” Many of the prisoners have come forth. There was a 16 per cent increase in number of publishers during the year, and there are now 10,989 in the field every month. The peak of publishers in the field during the year was 12,290. Much good work was done in this part of Africa, and in checking over the report we find an excellent increase in the number of hours devoted to field service. In fact, the company publishers there are each spending an average of 13.8 hours every month in preaching the good news. Through the Nigerian branch office, which is located in Lagos, we also direct the work in Cameroun, Dahomey, Togo and Fernando Po. The reports for these appear along with the Nigerian report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five assemblies were held, with an attendance of over 15,000, and 819 were immersed. Many of these were drawn from the smaller tribes of this multitribal country. Represented were Binis, Ijaws, Kwales, Isokos, Itsekiris, Urhobos, in addition to Eguns and Ewes from Dahomey and Togo. Some years ago some of these tribes were hardly represented at our assemblies, but now most of them come in such great numbers that they need meetings of their own. The peace and unity of these intertribal assemblies was a source of wonder to the local population and, not least of all, to the police, who are accustomed to much fighting and quarreling at intertribal gatherings. One man refused to believe that we had a “Lost and Found” booth until he was shown the place filled with articles. Amazed, he exclaimed, “Do you mean that when you lose something you actually get it back again?” These assemblies are doing much to convince skeptical worldlings that Jehovah’s witnesses really are a different people living according to righteous principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The advance of the truth into strongholds of false religion continues to rouse up the clergy and their followers and they retaliate in various ways. In some cases they take action against the brothers’ children attending the mission schools, severely caning them or expelling them; but this evil treatment usually boomerangs on them. An assembly was being held at Assay and the local townspeople who had built a school and donated it to a religious mission had agreed to allow the brothers to use it. On the morning of the opening day the headmaster returned from leave and promptly canceled the arrangement, maintaining this attitude in the face of requests from the local chief to allow us to use it. The brothers promptly got to work cutting bamboos and palm leaves and carrying material over twelve miles to build a booth. This they completed in six hours instead of the usual six days, to the utter astonishment of the townspeople, many of whom joined in the work. The assembly aroused much good will toward the brothers and now a new company has been formed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers continue to increase and they are having many wonderful experiences, which amply compensate them for all the hardships they have to endure. When reports were made of interested persons in a village in northern Nigeria, the nearest brother was a special pioneer over forty miles away. In company with the circuit servant he traveled there by bicycle. After losing their way they finally reached the place, almost exhausted. Their effort was rewarded, however, when they found over thirty persons studying the Bible, the only book they had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a further cause for joy when three of our own Nigerian brothers, graduates of Gilead’s 18th class, returned in May to take up their work as circuit servants. We hope that more will be able to follow them and return to serve their Nigerian brothers and assist in the work that lies ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The continued increase of the Kingdom work in this country shows us that there is still much to do and there are many more prisoners to be released from Satan’s prison houses. So while we reflect upon Jehovah’s evident blessing upon our past service, we look forward to greater things to come. We shall work and pray for 1953 to be the greatest year yet in the Nigerian field in which thousands more will be given the glorious hope of true freedom with everlasting security.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Cameroun continue to exercise their relative freedom to the best of their ability. They have no legal standing, as the Society is not permitted to operate. All of our publications are banned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sporadic outbursts of priest-inspired opposition have broken out in various places, but the brothers have resolutely maintained their faith. In Ebolowa the opposition was strong and sustained, but the brothers quietly moved to another meeting place where they are continuing with their studies and their preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A very fine experience, showing the zeal and real Bible knowledge these brothers have, came in recently. A man who desired to serve God, but lacked the knowledge, was persuaded to enter a Catholic seminary of the Trappist order. Here he lived a very austere life, spending nearly all his time in prayer. Eventually he was chosen to go to France to continue his studies. While he was spending a few days with his parents before leaving, a publisher called at their home. Of course, the man said he had learned all about the kingdom of God in the seminary. “But,” he says, “this only seemed to make the publisher all the more determined to preach to me. He began to tell me many things of which I was quite ignorant and I started to pay close attention. He told me that if I really wanted to serve God I must learn the truth. Later I went back to him with many questions and he answered everything just like a man who already knew what was in my mind.” Well, no doubt you have guessed the conclusion. Yes, the man became one of Jehovah’s witnesses instead of a Trappist.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Dahomey is one of the lands where the brothers are maintaining their Christian freedom under much opposition and hardship. The Catholic Church, like a tigress, continually uses the secular authorities to pounce on the brothers in an effort to scatter them and stop their work. This is a sign, not of her confidence, but rather of her fear of the Kingdom message, as shown by a recent report. A brother writes: “A Catholic priest and a juju priest conspired together to destroy the company at Dekin. According to the complaint they made, they accused the brothers of predicting a world war, seducing the people to revolt against the government, preaching the end of the world and refusing to pay tax. They told the commandant of the district that it is because of the brothers’ preaching that all the jujus have lost courage and refused to give rain, and that is why famine menaces the land. Finally, the Catholic priest said we were the cause of the inefflcacy of his prayers and masses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in spite of this the work continues to increase as the brothers press on with their preaching, using the Bible alone. These brothers are truly “standing firm in one spirit, with one soul fighting side by side for the faith of the good news” and Jehovah is blessing their efforts with increase. We have faith that he will continue to do so.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>TOGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Togo has made steady increase since it was organized last year. At the beginning of the year there was some opposition and the government authorities began confiscating all the literature they could find in an effort to intimidate the new brothers and put an end to the work. But these young ones are strong in faith and rather than being hindered in their service they have continued to expand. By exercising much tact in their witnessing and by confining their activity mainly to back-calls and home Bible studies with those of proved good will they are avoiding trouble and enjoying comparative peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Halfway through the year the company at Lome was so well established and making such good progress that it was found possible to send the special pioneer company servant to a new assignment at Palime. Here he quickly found much new interest and in the month of August he had 12 new publishers with him in the field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>FERNANDO PO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Since the authorities arrested the brothers last year and deported them from the island, there has been no organized preaching in Fernando Po. However, in recent months letters have reached us from an interested person and we have sent him small packets of booklets and tracts through the mail. We do not know if they arrived, but we shall continue to do all we can to keep in touch with any interest that shows itself on this benighted island.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has a branch office in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, and from there the preaching work over a great area is supervised. The report which has come in shows that in Northern Rhodesia the brothers have advanced in knowledge and gained in maturity. Missionaries in this area have traveled nearly 8,000 miles by van to reach the numerous circuit assemblies that were arranged for the benefit of the brothers there. In some of the more remote parts of their assignments, the missionaries could not travel all the way by van; so they sometimes made trips of from thirty to sixty miles by bicycle in order to reach their destination. Not only circuit servants and publishers made exceptional efforts to get to these assemblies, but also persons of good will. Although the work in Northern Rhodesia is growing by leaps and bounds, other countries under the jurisdiction of the Lusaka office are not so well served by ministers of the good news because they are not there to preach. This report covers Northern Rhodesia, Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Here are many interesting items that readers of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One group of three brothers and three sisters started out to an assembly from one of the farthest comers of the territory. They walked 70 miles and rode a truck for 320 miles only to find that the assembly was over before they reached their destination. Undaunted, they started out for another assembly, this time walking 120 miles, and made the assembly place in time to enjoy the full program. However, all this unprepared-for travel was a heavy drain on their meager provisions, and they started back home with only sufficient funds to ride part of the way. So they planned to cut across country and walk half the distance, a mere 250 miles!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At assemblies in the Luangwa Valley area, which is the big-game hunting center for the United States and other foreign visitors to this country, wildlife provided an unusual background. The district servant reports that during camp-fire gatherings in the evening the roaring of the lions in the vicinity was so great that it drowned out the singing of Kingdom songs by the brothers behind the seemingly inadequate protection of a grass fence. The conventioners slept under these unique circumstances, keeping fires burning at the entrances to the enclosure. How glad these brothers will be when “the lion shall eat straw like the ox”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Memorial attendance of 62,038 meant that an average of one person in thirty in the country attended that Christian celebration. This is indeed a phenomenal figure, and must surely present cause for anxiety among the ranks of our religious enemies. It gives evidence also, however, of the amazing potential the publishers have to work with in Northern Rhodesia, and lays a real basis for greater increases to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work among the European population has also shown a healthy increase. Many have indeed pressed on to maturity in studying and in sharing in the greatest work of all, going from house to house with the Kingdom message. They have shown more mature appreciation of the need for assembling together also, and at a recent circuit assembly we had the best average attendances for any European assembly to date in the country, with a peak gathering of 130 at the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost all the publications released by the Society up to 1946 are banned in Northern Rhodesia, and in 1949 the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> was added to this list. However, Jehovah brought us victory in his own due time. First we enjoyed the release of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine in 1949, and then permission to use all the new publications published from 1950 onward. This year has brought a further gain for Theocracy. Although the first edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> remains on the prohibited list, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> Second Edition, has been passed by the government for use in this territory. Thus we have another instrument to assist us in our advance to mature understanding of Jehovah’s will. We are ever grateful to our heavenly Provider for all the bounteous gifts he bestows upon us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“We are like a bag of African corn. Wherever they shall take us the Word will drop one by one until the time when the rain will come and they shall see us raised up everywhere.” So stated one of the brothers from the Belgian Congo. He was one of a group who had suffered much at the hands of authorities in the Belgian territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His words certainly reflect the spirit of the brothers who are still living witnesses to the Most High God behind the “iron curtain” that surrounds the Belgian Congo, where the ban on the witness work continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “bag of African com” is certainly being spread in the Congo in spite of, or rather because of, the persecution of the brothers. At one time the branch office at Lusaka received reports of several hundred persons associating with the witnesses in the Kolwezi area. However, news now tells of numbers of those being transported to other parts of the Congo, but we can be assured that “the Word will drop one by one” in readiness for a great harvest when the rains of refreshing come from Jehovah as they surely will for the vindication of his name and his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother had planted seeds of interest in the mind of a person of good will, and the man so enjoyed what he had been told that he thoughtlessly read his Bible in the view of a detective. The detective questioned him, because anyone seen reading a Bible </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5"> be “one of the Watch Tower”. The man agreed to having contact with the witnesses, and eventually his confession led to the arrest of the brother. At one time these arrests were reported only from the towns and larger centers, but now the zeal of the police in this Roman Catholic country has led them to round up whom they can in the villages also. Apparently the authorities send the brothers far from their homes and put them to work under strict surveillance. They must report to the district commissioner every Monday to be counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have reports which show that about 250 brothers are having some share in the preaching work in various parts of the country, but there are probably many more. The witnessing is confined to back-calls and home Bible studies and this with very little or no literature, as the brothers never know when their homes are to be searched. One brother was reported by one of his so-called “friends” as being in possession of two booklets, and he was sentenced to two months in the Central prison at Elizabethville.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark240"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Larger than France and with a population of about 30,000 Europeans, 101,000 Indians, 24,000 Arabs and more than 5,000,000 Africans, this strategically vital British colony forms one of the important highways of Central Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Gilead graduate personally visited the Chief Advisor on African Affairs and also the Member for Law and Order, to appeal against the previous decision that had been made to refuse the Society the right to establish European control of its work in the territory and the right of entry of Gilead missionaries to preach the “good news of peace”. The appeal was unsuccessful even though one of these officials admitted that the grounds of refusal of the Society’s proposals were illogical. No reasons were given for their decision; there could be no valid reason! All missionary activities in this country are controlled by a zoning system which necessitates association with a church council, and a division of the missionary field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With these restrictions by the government, the work in Kenya cries out for help. Apart from three families, including one recently arriving in the colony, little witnessing of any sort has been done and what has been done has been almost exclusively in the Nairobi district. Circumstances have made regular attendance at organized weekly studies difficult to arrange and maintain, and long leaves break into their continuity. Notwithstanding this, and the general apathy of the Europeans, there has been progress made in giving the witness, and it is expected that the new service year will see increases and a consolidation of the good will present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are very grateful to know that the Society will continue to press for its rights to preach the gospel in this vast land, divided as it is by religion, race, customs and allegiances.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the service year a personal visit was made by one of the Gilead graduates on the government officials who have had to do with the banning of our literature and the prohibition of our missionaries’ entering the country; and as a result of such meeting (where a written memorandum was asked for and presented covering such things as our attitude toward other religious bodies, flag saluting, etc.) we had renewed hopes that the previously-held ban on missionaries would be lifted. However, in June of this year a letter was received from the Tanganyika government stating that their attitude had not changed and that they were still not prepared to let Watch Tower missionaries enter the country; and, as always in the past, still without giving any reason for their refusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the high lights of the year was a circuit assembly which one of the Gilead graduates was permitted to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gilead graduate described it as follows: “We were close to the assembly spot in the late afternoon and had hopes of arriving by dark; then the heavens literally fell on us in a torrent of water. To go ahead was impossible, as we could not see the road for the driving rain. We stopped the van and prepared to spend the night the best way possible, for, far from giving any indication of abating, the storm seemed to be increasing in intensity. However, the next morning the rain did stop, and after wading for a distance we finally reached the assembly site and found some brothers. Much to our surprise, they were amazed that we should even suggest that the assembly could not be held. Of course the brothers would come! But they did express grave doubts that some would be able to attend, for every river was out of its banks and some would be unable to cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And come they did, although it meant that some had to walk in that weather for two to three days. The attendance on Sunday afternoon reached 419, and that morning 61 symbolized their dedication by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of the Machusa tribe have shown exceptional good will toward our work. Publishers have reported that it is not unusual to go into a village and begin to talk to one person and to have that person ask the publisher to wait for a moment, and then go and bring all the rest of the village so they can hear the witness too. This may be due in part to the fact that the most of them are out-and-out pagans. Neither the so-called Christian religion nor Mohammedanism has made any great inroad on their way of life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>UGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Indifference or apathy to the Kingdom message is the big obstacle facing the publishers in Uganda. People are so occupied with sports and recreation that they will just not give time to read or discuss the vital message in Jehovah’s Word. You can imagine the joy it brings to the publishers when they meet a hearing ear among so many deaf ones. One brother reports: “Sister was thrilled with joy the other day when she encountered a lady who took five copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and said that she should come again. She has just arrived from Wales, and we are hoping to start a study with her shortly.” Another difficulty in the way of increase in this territory is the shifting population. The brother writes: “We have noticed here in Kampala that no sooner do we find an interested person who will listen to the Kingdom message than he is transferred to another station.” Several pieces of literature have been placed with these “nomads” and, no doubt, it is the sowing of seeds of interest for Jehovah to bring the increase elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the missionaries and another publisher from Northern Rhodesia spent their vacation touring by car in East Africa, and they were able to meet the family of publishers in Kampala and discuss with them the good things of Jehovah’s Word and work. The publishers were really grateful for this opportunity of meeting others of like precious faith, and expressed again the hope that soon they might have a missionary of their own in Uganda to assist them in the preaching work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Norwegian brothers performed very good service during 1952. They, along with hundreds of thousands throughout the rest of the world, have been saying to the prisoners, “Go forth.” Norway is a hilly and rough country, but Jehovah’s witnesses in that country know how to get around in it. They are used to the terrain, and when the call came to go out into unassigned territory they moved out into parts of the country where people had never received a witness before. A splendid work has been accomplished again, and we find a 10 per cent increase in number of publishers. They now average 2,072, to compare with 1,888 in 1951. All of these have had their minds set on the matter of growth toward maturity. This was forcefully brought to the attention of all Jehovah’s witnesses last year as they went forth giving of the good news to others. The branch servant sends in an interesting report, and excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had the privilege to have Brothers Knorr, Henschel and Jensen with us in the latter part of September 1951. Many of the Norwegian brothers had been to the Clean Worship Assembly in London. They were thrilled because of all the good things they learned there, and when they gave their report after returning home they made all the brothers enthused for the national assembly which was going to be held at Lillehammer September 21-23. Oslo, the capital of Norway, did not have any hall that was big enough, so the assembly was arranged for at Lillehammer, a small tourist and industrial town by the Mjosa lake. The brothers were anxious to come, and the rooming committee had to find rooming accommodations for 1,600. That is a great many visitors for a city of 14,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Norway is a country that is very sparsely populated. The people are scattered alongside the many fjords and valleys, and thousands of them have never heard the truth. Some territories were worked before the last war by traveling pioneers, but since then there has been no Kingdom witnessing there. It has been quite a problem to reach all these people living in unassigned territory, but the 1952 summer campaign in unassigned territory was the answer. This arrangement brought great joy to the brothers. They were eager to go out in the rurals or to work unassigned industrial centers, and they were able to place many more books than they usually do. There were 19,949 books and 48,442 booklets placed during the three months of the campaign. The office received about 6,000 names of interested persons. It meant a lot of work to take care of all these names, sending them letters and sample copies of the magazines, but we were glad to do it, knowing that it would bring many more good-will persons out into Jehovah’s freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A company servant relates how his company had their unassigned territory far away in a deep valley. Because of the distance they could not go back and forth to the territory the same day, but they arranged groups that stayed in the territory three or four days at a time. One day he went out with a bicycle group of four witnesses. They split up in twos working toward each other on both sides of the valley, and to their surprise they met very soon. They had planned to use all day in that territory, but they did not find the people home. Almost all the houses were empty. The brothers learned that the people of the valley had left for their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">saeters,</span><span class="font5"> their mountain pastures, and to get there they would have to climb the mountain for four hours. What were they to do? Well, they had come there to find people, not empty houses, so they decided to leave their bicycles, tent and sleeping bags down in the valley and climb the hills. The next morning they put literature in their rucksacks, and off they went. Three thousand feet up with heavy loads on the back is not easy, but after four hours they arrived at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">saeters,</span><span class="font5"> finding both cattle, sheep and goats, and people too. After a short rest they started witnessing. The people were sheeplike, and they were able to place much literature. They did not regret the effort they had made to get there. Going down to the valley was worse than going up. Going down and down makes the feet numb and quivering; so they were happy to find their tent and sleeping bags and have a good night’s rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young pioneer sister, 18 years old, went all by herself to the innermost part of Sognefjorden, the longest fjord in the world. Her unassigned territory was made up of some industrial centers and the surrounding rurals. There had been none of Jehovah’s witnesses there before. During the first month of her work there she placed 450 bound books, many booklets and magazines, and obtained 11 subscriptions. Much interest was manifested. Here is one of her experiences when she was witnessing to some industrial workers living in the barracks belonging to a large factory: “The first day I talked to five or six persons who were gathered in one room. I found out that one of them had some knowledge of the truth, since he had attended a couple of studies at a different place. He thought it was instructive and interesting, and wanted to continue the study and summoned the others to join in. When they had all received their books they agreed to do so. I showed them the method we use in conducting our studies, and they were very attentive. But who was going to be study conductor? This they also discussed and decided that one of them who had also subscribed for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazine should take care of that.” This pioneer sister also had interesting experiences in the rurals. “Away up in a valley I found an old lady who was very emphatic in telling me that she did not want any books, because she had two books that were so fine that she did not need any others. The books were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Truth Shall Make You Free.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It makes it difficult for Jehovah’s witnesses when false rumors and lies are circulated about them. This has often been true in Nyasaland. Our brothers are accused of many things and the lies pass from one mouth to another. Of course, this reflects on Jehovah’s witnesses until the people to whom they witness listen and learn the truth. Sometimes the children of Jehovah’s witnesses are forced to leave school because of the lies that are told about them. Sometimes trouble arises within the organization itself, such as when some are morally unclean, and that brings a reflection on the whole organization. That is something, however, that Jehovah’s witnesses have control of, and they can disfellowship or set aside those who bring reproach from within. There is little that Jehovah’s witnesses can do about the persecution that comes from the Devil’s organization, however, except to live good lives, preach the good news of the Kingdom and hold fast to that which God has given them. In the end everything will come out all right, because the truth will always conquer. It is always better to serve Jehovah than to serve men. The branch office at Blantyre, Nyasaland, has jurisdiction over the country of Nyasaland and also Portuguese East Africa, and the report which follows is composed of excerpts from the branch servant’s writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Cinyanja issue of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine of September 1951 contained the articles “In Defense of Marriage” and “Let Marriage Be Honorable Among All”. They proved to be a hard lesson to many then living under the style of common-law marriage so general in this country. Quite a large number have preferred to go on living in common-law marriage, determining for themselves their field of freedom in marriage, not wanting to recognize nor to be led by Jehovah’s all-wise ruling in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As time went on it was seen that still others were not making their minds over to new world living even though they had a knowledge of the truth. They continued to live according to the old personality, preferring plural marriages and a life of drunken orgies and other suchlike disorderly behavior instead of the wholesome lead and life-giving counsel appearing in the articles of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine. So these too “went out”, and have remained out there in Satan’s world of chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of these conditions it will be seen how fitting and helpful and bracing has been the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">article “Keeping the Organization Clean&quot;. The servants in the companies are learning to shoulder the responsibility of keeping the companies clean from disorderly persons, and they are finding great assistance in this in the backing given by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles. There has been a great shaking and reorganization in the majority of companies in the country, all of which has assisted those who remain toward maturity and a more theocratic way of life than was formerly followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very often of an evening in the villages where we were accommodated we would perch ourselves on the top of the highest thatched roof with the car battery and our portable amplifier next to us and put over a public talk. As the nights were usually still and sound carried very well the villagers sitting out in the cool of the evening outside their grass huts would listen in and many found much interest in the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite a number of European immigrants have come into the country during the past twelve months and some of these are showing an interest in the truth. We have a young man who was once a Mohammedan but who is now active as a publisher, and a couple of others who are very much interested. We find that the Gujarati Bibles and the Society’s literature in that language are being well received, particularly by a number of Indian traders who live out in the native villages away from their own national religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Viewed as a whole the service year has been a very quiet one. We have been busy putting the “house” in order, as it were, aiming to be a better and more vigorous organization equipped for the opening service year. We do not even have a “lion story” to give some local color to this year’s account! We have been battling against the far more formidable “roaring lion”, and thank Jehovah God for the way of escape through his organization from that evil one and his old and corrupt world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year in this vast and primitive country heavy rains in some districts brought much hardship and suffering to the unfortunate inhabitants. Along the banks of the Zambezi river many square miles of cultivated land including villages were rendered unworkable and uninhabitable. The shortage of foodstuffs that followed this havoc brought the people to the borderline of starvation, with the specter of death through hunger creeping in on them. The brothers there continued to take the message of hope and comfort to the people, pointing them to that world where such distressful conditions will be no more. And the comfort and strength that only Jehovah can provide are with his people there as they meet this test of their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Happily on the vast Sena Sugar Estates conditions are more favorable. A pioneer was assigned there two months ago and is doing some good work in assisting the brothers toward better organization and closer adherence to the service methods contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel</span><span class="font5"> booklet. We hope to see others joining him in the pioneer service shortly and so becoming more conscious of their responsibilities as ambassadors for Jehovah’s new world government. There is much interest on the estates but the people need to be gathered together and instructed and led into the field of service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The world’s fifth-largest state and the largest Moslem country is Pakistan. This country has its problems with famine, widespread unrest, corruption, and with the people who believe a religion which closes their minds to other thoughts. But even here a small group of publishers, 44 on the average every month, keep preaching the good news of the Kingdom. The manner in which one preaches to Moslems is altogether different from the manner in which one preaches in other countries. The approach must be made in a careful manner, taking into consideration the personal conduct of the people, the arguments they will employ and how such arguments can be refuted. When a Bible study is arranged, it is difficult to have it in the home of the person with whom you wish to study until he is really soundly established in the truth. So the problems of the Kingdom publishers in Pakistan are great, but they press on </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">with the joy of Jehovah. They are happy to give the good news to others. The branch servant of Pakistan gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of our problem of getting the truth to the Moslems you can imagine our delight upon getting the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> with its chapter on Islam. This, thought we, is right down our street. But there still remained the difficulty of bridging the gap between the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Quran</span><span class="font5"> and the Bible. So how great was our delight to get the series of articles on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Quran</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> giving us the very arguments we had longed for! How truly David declared: “There is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.” It was a Kingdom Hall study of these articles that most helped one Moslem in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An amusing illustration of the different outlook of the Moslems follows: As a missionary witnessed to one in his house he suddenly rose up, spread out his prayer rug, did his exercises and then returned to resume the discussion, taking the set of books offered. Similarly they will leave in the middle of a public lecture for some other room, say their prayers, and then return to their seat for the rest of the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower organization and its publications are well known all over Karachi. One missionary in particular has penetrated into the deepest bazaars and is known and respected throughout the city. They term him “the man of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outside of Karachi centers of interest are established and some witnessing has been accomplished, sometimes by persons in extreme poverty and isolated from all fellowship except for the visit of the circuit servant and letters from the office. Yet they faithfully continue their service. One of these, desperately poor, traveled over a thousand miles to the assembly during Brother Knorr’s visit, his fare being paid by a good-will Moslem to whom he had witnessed. Said this Moslem before a crowd of others upon his return: “I think we ought to give heed to what these people say. I went to their convention and can say I have never seen people like them; they certainly practice what they preach.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant visiting these isolated ones has a difficult but extremely happy time of it. He reports going to one “Christian” village and finding the clergy had abandoned the flock which, in self-interest, would assemble every evening to sing hymns. Here for an hour under the stars he spoke to them about the new world, while two youths posted themselves on either side and tanned him, and little children would steal up to him and teel his white skin. He lett them after making arrangements for somebody to teach them further from one of the books. Villages like this can be duplicated by the hundreds in the Punjab, made up entirely of “Christians” who have never heard the Kingdom message. Already from among them we have some stalwart publishers in our midst, but there are millions not yet contacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now back to Karachi. Here we enjoy some interesting experiences. In our effort to support the unassigned territory campaign we had a most interesting time and at least one person is now associated and others are showing interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young couple was receiving religious instruction from a local Adventist group when a missionary called and pointed out certain facts to her. For a time the couple studied with both the Adventists and the witness, but at last they decided to bring things to a head. This they did by arranging for the witness and the Adventist clergy to meet. The “trinity” was discussed, and after it was over they declined further instruction from the Adventists and are now regular Kingdom publishers. Another couple attached to the same sect were in high favor with the ones in charge and the husband was offered training and a job as pastor. But just then a witness contacted them and they turned down the offer. They preferred life to a soft job.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The number of publishers in the country of Panama did not increase during the year, but the publishers certainly did increase in joy, maturity and in their field-service activity. While there were fewer publishers, they devoted more time in the field, more subscriptions were obtained, more back-calls were made and more Bible studies conducted. This adds up to maturity. So when the publishers look over their report they are not at all discouraged, because they do see progress. There are wonderful opportunities for the future, because they reached a peak of publishers of 562 during the year, and the Memorial attendance was 909; so the prospects are really good. The branch serv</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ant sends in an interesting report, and excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the two missionaries in David, third-largest city in the republic where a company averaging 32 publishers thrives, comes the following assembly report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It was a great event in David when, in the middle of the republic’s biggest political campaign, Jehovah’s witnesses planned an assembly there for three days. Though David lies 300 miles west of the capital city, several buses and cars from there and other parts of the country came in over the dusty, rocky roads in the dry season. It was a great pleasure preparing for this assembly and the brothers here really showed their love for those who came in from afar. Those not too far out gave lodging while others brought beds and cots and one lady of good will who runs a furniture store allowed a couple to use a fine bed in the display room during the three days. The Gilead graduates had rented a home with an ideal shady </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">patio</span><span class="font5"> for the sessions, and so with an improvised stage set up all meetings turned out fine. The home was filled with beds and there was room for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No sooner had our brothers gone when work started on our new Kingdom Hall, which surely proved to be another tremendous witness to the town. It made one think of how it must have been in Noah’s day; people continually passing by asking what the hall would be for, and it gave the brothers working on it many wonderful opportunities to witness. Of course, many scoffed, but others showed interest and all the town came. We are very happy to have this assignment of territory where we are able to help many persons of good will to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another reports: “After receiving one subscription for the evening I was called by an American soldier who desired three subscriptions, one to be sent his mother-in-law, one to his mother and the third for himself and his wife. A study was started with these sheeplike people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Working from house to house, I met a Seventh-Day Adventist, well versed on the Law, who tried to prove that the Law was still in force. After checking scriptures for one and one-half hours, he took the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> After the second study he came to the area study and, though his eyes do not permit reading at night, he made several comments. He said to the others in attendance, 'You have had opportunity to study this lesson, so comment, as this will further enlighten us.’ At the close of the study, he expressed much joy and assured us that diligent preparation of his lesson for the following week would be made.” Another example of the rapid progress being made in this area is to be noted from the following: “I was sent for by a family that had just moved into my territory. The man of good will said: ‘I have been a Catholic all my days, holding a high position in the organization, but I left it recently because I could not see where some of the teachings were based on the Bible. Now I am interested in the Seventh-Day Adventist organization, but I want answers to these questions: (1) What is the sabbath? (2) Why must I change my diet? (3) Why the Law, and what portion must I keep? I heard that Jehovah’s witnesses could answer these questions for me. I have a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’ </span><span class="font5">and like it.’ A study, twice weekly, and of two hours’ duration was arranged. In four studies by diligently using the Bible, his questions were answered to his satisfaction. The third week he and his family attended the company </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study with me. This is the fifth week, and he has made arrangements to accompany me in service. His zeal and love for Jehovah are rapidly increasing as he spends many hours preparing his lessons. Another prisoner freed.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">One of the inland countries of South America is called Paraguay. As in all other parts of the world, we find distress, high cost of living and great changes taking place during the last days of this old world. Jehovah’s witnesses are going about in Paraguay, offering to the people what the new system of things has in store. A number are hearing, but they are not coming out in great crowds. Those that are coming forward are of the great crowd that will enjoy life in the new world. There was only a slight increase in the average number of publishers during the year, but a peak of 164 was reached. All of these are gaining a better knowledge of Jehovah’s Word, and we look forward to an excellent year during 1953. Some of the excerpts from the branch servant’s report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now eight Gilead graduates in Paraguay, and they are having a good share in extending the message of the Kingdom. Especially have the missionaries taken good advantage of the three months’ campaign during June, July and August, to work unassigned territory. Taking to heart the suggestion offered in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> that the missionaries use a day a week to work some of these unassigned territories, we started with one of the most notoriously religious cities in Paraguay, named CaacupA Every year the Catholic Church has a pilgrimage to that city, and the people from all parts of Paraguay go there to worship the “Virgin of Caacup£”, and they expect a miracle from her. But in this religious city we found many persons of good will who are sighing and crying because of the abominations done there and who are getting their eyes opened to the fact that the people are worshiping a false god under a false religion. Many books, booklets, magazines and tracts were placed there, back-calls were made, and now arrangements are being made to have Bible studies with the interested ones. We expect to have a small company of pure worshipers there soon, worshiping the true God in spirit and in truth with the one true religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the company publishers tells us of an experience he had while witnessing to the police in a police station: “During the three months’ campaign to work unassigned territory I went with the missionaries on every opportunity that I had. One day while working in a small city the police station happened to be in my assignment. While I was witnessing to the police the Catholic priest of the town came in and rudely interrupted our conversation, asking me what I was doing there and telling me that I had no right to do that work there. I told him that it was a God-given right to preach the message of the Kingdom and therefore no individual or government had the right to restrict the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. Also I told him that the Constitution of Paraguay granted the right of freedom of religion and that I had been doing this work for a number of years and had not been molested by the police, because they are to uphold the constitutional rights of the people. At that time one of the missionaries saw the Catholic priest and me in the police station and, thinking that I was in trouble, came in to help me. He at once began to read scriptures from the Bible showing that preaching the Kingdom message is a God-given right. At this the priest became enraged and said he did not want to hear what the Bible said as he knew what was in it. At this remark the police were greatly astonished. Since the scriptures read were all in our favor the police would not interfere with our work. We left a few magazines and tracts with them and continued in our work from house to house. The priest, unable to frustrate our work, returned to his parish greatly enraged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the year was the visit of Brother Knorr’s personal representative, Brother Donald Baxter. As it had been three years since the visit of Brother Knorr in 1949, we were glad when we heard that we would have another visit by a special representative of the Society. We at once made arrangements to have a national assembly at the time of his visit, as we wanted all the brothers in Paraguay to be present to hear the brother’s talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, it is always necessary to find a place that is clean and adequate to hold the conventioners comfortably. Immediately the search began. As the Catholic Church had just launched a vigorous campaign against missionaries, the owners of the clubs and halls were intimidated against renting us a suitable place to hold our assembly. Much time was used by the brothers in looking for a hall, but always the same answer, “We are sorry but we can’t let you have it, as the Catholic bishop has ordered us not to rent our property to those </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">evangilicos.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This created a great problem. Our own hall is far too small to hold a gathering like this, so what was to be done? Since no weapon can be formed against Jehovah and he declares that the message is to go forth, we took a new and more zealous look at the seemingly impossible situation. We decided, why not build a platform and put up lights and bamboo mats for shade right in our back yard? But the question remained, What would we do if it rained? Although we were in the rainy season, we had a nice week of the best weather possible in Paraguay. This worked to good advantage all round. We saved the rent money, had our assembly and also our cafeteria with all its trimmings right in our own yard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark251"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In the Spanish-speaking country of Peru the work has moved on grandly. Here, too, we find many people worshiping Jehovah in holy array. The increase in the number of those associated with Jehovah’s people has brought real joy to the hearts of everyone. Two hundred sixty publishers engaged in the field service every month. This is a 29 per cent increase over the previous year. There are only nine organized companies throughout the land, but there are many individuals scattered here and there who are reading and studying and who will soon be publishers. The unassigned territory work was started, but practically all of Peru is unassigned territory. The brothers had a grand time during the threemonth campaign, getting out of their home territory and into new territory. The brothers had a number of interesting experiences, and the branch servant reports a number of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our special pioneer in Chosica relates how he has been able to establish five studies in Casapalca by accepting the invitation of one of the publishers to visit some “sheep” he had found in this small mining town. This publisher, a brakeman on the railroad, found the interest by witnessing to other employees for a few minutes each time he met them as he passed through this station. One couple has now moved to Callao, where the wife is an active publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Arequipa a missionary reports how a priest accosted him and demanded that he get out of his parish at once. Failing in this, he soon returned with a policeman. The missionary explained the work to the policeman, but the latter took him to the station. There our work was again explained, although the priest kept on interrupting. Finally the commander told the priest to keep quiet, and ended up commending our work, contributing for a book and booklet, and offering to help if further trouble arose. A similar victory was reported from lea, with a civilian complainant instead of a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not finding her Bible-study family at home, one missionary took the initiative by witnessing to some other people who were taking care of the home. The man showed interest, and a study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are very glad to have the help of six more Gilead graduates this year. One of them relates the following: “This couple listened so attentively that I offered to come the next week to study their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> with them. They gladly consented. Each week the attendance increased until six or seven attended regularly. Then one who was attending asked if I could visit them in their home for the benefit of their children. Now we have four to ten attending his study. About two weeks ago one of this family asked, ‘Would you please come with me to another home? The family is in distress; they need a Bible study.’ This resulted in another family of five studying.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From just the name and address of a person of good will came a fine experience. He was a Catholic who had never read the Bible, but he liked the testimony he had overheard. As we did not have any literature, we began a study with the tract </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</span><span class="font5"> He was impressed. For the second call we studied </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake from Sleep!</span><span class="font5"> and with that he wanted his own Bible and a study in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font5">On his second visit to the Kingdom Hall he brought one of his music pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The valuable system of centering the service in the company book-study groups has been put to fuller use, the line has been more clearly defined between persons of good will incidentally talking about the message and those actively participating in door-to-door work when physically able, and more of the company duties have been placed on the shoulders of the local brothers. Forty-five symbolized their dedication by baptism. But we realize we have barely scratched the surface of the work in Peru; so at the outset of this new service year we are determined to work ever harder for maturity, so essential to increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">True worship made its advances in the Philippines during the past service year. Efforts were made by the district servants, circuit servants and company servants to bring about real maturity among the publishers of the Kingdom. Stress was laid upon meeting attendance, individual study, training in the field and obedience to all Jehovah’s instructions as set forth in his Word. Wonderful progress has been made along all these lines. This year we find 14,890 publishers regularly preaching the good news of the Kingdom in the Philippines. This is a 16.8 per cent increase over the previous service year. The work in the Philippines is moving along wonderfully, and we now see a peak of 17,520 publishers worshiping Jehovah in holy array along with the other publishers all over the world. The branch servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tells us about some very interesting experiences, and a few of them are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s counsel on clean conduct caused an adjustment to occur in the living habits of many who previously were negligent or indifferent to the high moral precepts of God’s Word. Even those who had been living in common-law marriage for many years saw the need of getting legally married and did so. Incidentally, the Philippine government authorized many of the Society’s ministers to solemnize marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six district assemblies were held throughout this country during January, February and March of 1952. These were conducted in the Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, Cebu-Visayan and Hiligaynon-Visayan dialects. A total of 20,180 persons attended the district assembly public meetings and 680 were baptized in symbol of their dedication to do God’s will. This served as a fine impetus for our Memorial activity in April, with the result that 20,795 attended the Memorial celebration and 26,538 attended the public meetings during Memorial week end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this intense activity was bound to stir up attention, much of it favorable, some of it unfavorable. The bloody assault against our brothers at the circuit assembly in Solana, Cagayan, on April 20 has already been reported in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of August 15,1952. On June 8 a parish priest of Santa Barbara, Iloilo, incited a mass demonstration against Jehovah’s witnesses who were meeting in circuit assembly there. He succeeded in having their public meeting permit canceled. After several attempts to get a permit for the Santa Barbara plaza, Jehovah’s witnesses were able to hold a meeting through the intervention of the provincial governor. This meeting was violated by Roman Catholic fanatics who set up eleven loud-speakers on homes near the plaza and “jammed” the speaker’s voice with loud “mambo” music. This kind of interference spread to the town of Tigbauan, where a parish priest used the loudspeakers on his church bell tower to interfere with the public meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. A tremendous protest erupted in the newspapers against this bigotry and intolerance. The priests and fanatics took a terrific roasting in editorials and feature stories and they are still feeling the heat. Additionally, the parish priest of Tigbauan is facing an injunctive suit in court for disturbing our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experiences of individual publishers show the effort they put forth and the joys they are reaping. One Gilead graduate speaks Ilocano, Tagalog, Zambale, Bolinao, Pangasinan and English in order to serve the multi-tongued population of his circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While calling back on an expired subscription in a business house, an alert American missionary followed up a casual friendly remark of a traveler who identified himself as a Presbyterian. He expressed admiration for Jehovah’s witnesses but did not know much about their doctrines. A leading question from the missionary, followed by a brief discussion on one chapter of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> resulted in the placement of two bound books with this man. His name was obtained and sent to the branch office for contact by correspondence. Two subscriptions were obtained by the missionary from the businessman she was waiting to see when the above conversation occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A tiny group of fifteen brothers, some from faraway Davao, accepted Cotabato, Cotabato, as their unassigned territory. They worked as much of it as they could and climaxed the effort with a public meeting. What a surprise when these fifteen counted five hundred at the public meeting! What a field for future witnessing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are just a few of the experiences sent in to the office along with the more than 2,600 names to be contacted by further correspondence from here. The field of theocratic activity seems to broaden each year, and we look forward to much more development in the coming twelve months. Our fine new branch building now under construction will be a wonderful aid in this development. The seven who are now in Gilead should also contribute much in bringing the local publishers to maturity if they are assigned as missionaries to the Philippines. With our new printed dialect </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers, </span><span class="font5">a new branch building, a new service year and renewed minds, we are all set for more action.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark254"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the past service year special attention was given to gathering together the other sheep who had been scattered by the great storm of a few years ago in Poland. In these changed circumstances the brothers have had to adopt new methods in order to carry on the preaching of the good news, and they have been very successful. The living water of life has been flowing regularly into Poland, and the weak knees have been made strong. There is real courage in the hearts of our fellow workers in that land. The great obstacle of disorganization that stood in the way for a while is now overcome, and systematic arrangements for field service are in operation. In general, there have been no difficulties throughout the year, and the efforts of the enemy to stop the preaching in Poland have failed thus far. A marvelous increase is seen in the number of other sheep being gathered into the organization. As Poland is behind the Iron Curtain, we are not saying how many are now reporting as ministers of the good news, but we are happy to note that there has been an excellent increase and that many of the other sheep have associated themselves with God’s organization and are worshiping Jehovah in holy array. They are a happy people, even in their persecution, as the report which follows will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work grows stronger every day and is sprouting like a sound branch in springtime. It fears no storm and no drought. It is stronger than at any time before. Although no public activity is possible here, other ways that have been accessible to us have proved practicable in order to get in touch with the people of good will, so much so that the Catholic clergy in a certain region felt forced to distribute a pamphlet among their parishioners, warning them and drawing their attention to various working methods observed by us. This is an example showing that our work continues to be strong enough to keep them in constant fear of losing their flocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In many parts of the country the hunger for truth has become ever greater. Late in the evening two servants arrived at the home of a brother where a meeting had been arranged for five o’clock the next morning. At 11 p.m. they went to bed, very tired. Two and a half hours later they were awakened with the words: “Wake up, shepherds, because the sheep are hungry.” In the dead of night, regardless of dangers, 17 persons had come (7 brothers and 10 interested ones) to hear words of encouragement. In joyful mood four hours passed while up-to-date thoughts were vivaciously exchanged. Another brother, traveling by railroad, witnessed to a nun and a girl student. Both asked for his address in order to visit him. As he was giving his address another girl student asked whether she might visit him regarding this matter. She too noted his address. Several times she came to see him, but he was never at home. She finally met him three months after and was happy to invite him to her home. There he found twelve persons assembled who had hearing ears for the truth. Six of them, three men and three women, are students of medicine and law. All were willing to learn and only two months later some began telling the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the time of fiery persecution a brother went into an isolated territory and began witnessing. Two years later there are 33 publishers there, all immersed. This brother has now gone into yet another territory to tell the prisoners there, “Go forth.” Another brother acknowledged having long been interested in the truth, yet he had never decided to engage in gospel-preaching. It was only when he learned about the courageous attitude of the imprisoned brothers that he was spurred on to preach. This proved a blessing also for the others, for his wife now visits three families and he has started thirty-five home Bible studies, some of which he has ceded to other workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In many companies there is such an enthusiasm that even the youngest and the oldest do not want to hold back. A 100-year-old sister, young in the truth, conducts a Bible study with her 70-year-old daughter and her 50-year-old granddaughter. Recently a brother died at the age of 103 years. During his last years he had the immense joy of seeing all the members of his family— 27 persons—engage in the fight for a peaceful new world. Then we have a 75-year-old sister doing 35 hours’ preaching a month. She makes good use of every opportunity, either by witnessing orally to her neighbors or by writing letters. She has several interested persons. A 16-year-old son said to his father when visiting him in prison that he would represent him in everything and help his 15 good-will persons to get out of the spiritual prison. These are not mere words, for the young brother had already acquainted 13 persons with the truth and looked after them himself. Most of them are already publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another village a publisher went to see an interested person whom he had not visited for some time, but he found little interest. However, the person’s neighbor listening in to the conversation became interested and a Bible study was started. After a short time there were six publishers in the village. For many years a company had repeatedly tried to establish a group in an isolated holiday resort, but without success. Now a year ago a sister found a job in that place and began to look for other sheep. At present there are thirty persons there receiving education through regular study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many other joyful experiences have been had showing very clearly that success in the service is possible only when the brothers are fully conscious of their responsibility and have full confidence in God and his provisions. Fear has the effect of a brake. When a circuit servant who had become fearful was replaced by one full of faith, there was an increase of 90 publishers within two months. The only opportunities for public witnesses are the burials of our relatives. On such occasions the brothers often go many miles in order to meet with the others, exchange experiences and manifest their firm attitude before the world. Often there are more than 500 persons gathered together and many new home Bible studies result from conversations with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Filled with gratitude toward our Father for his undeserved kindness, we lift up our voice with strength and assurance, calling to those still in Babylon: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.”—Rev. 18: 4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">No year has equaled 1952 for the brothers in the truth as far as new events are concerned. All of these things have brought them real blessings and theocratic advances. The outstanding item of the year is the fine increase in number of publishers, 590 of whom are reporting every month. A new peak of 653 has been reached. The joy felt in obtaining these marks of theocratic expansion is expressed very well by the branch servant. Part of the report he sent in is copied here. The Virgin Islands are under the Puerto Rican branch, and part of this report concerns them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three successive peaks at the beginning of the serv-ive year brought the number of publishers up from 517 to 622. April topped that with 653, and our Memorial attendance hit a new high of 1,038. The day following the Memorial an event occurred which, while occasioning considerable sorrow, is still having its effect on the work in a beneficial way. It was the plane disaster in which two of our most experienced missionaries lost their lives. Immense publicity was given them by radio and press and it is doubtful if any other single event accomplished so much to bring our work to the attention of the people as did the death of these two faithful servants. Also, the sorrow shared by all had the effect of unifying more closely the publishers island-wide. Were we not all of the same family under Christ Jesus? How good it was, then, that even in their death they were able to serve Jehovah’s righteous purpose and help in his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April was also the month when our newest missionary home was opened in San German, second-oldest city in the island and location of one of the oldest cathedrals in the Western Hemisphere, “Porta Coeli,” built in 1538. The four young girls composing the missionary group might as well have been an invading army as far as the local priest was concerned. When he awoke to the fact that they were witnessing throughout the town he bounced into action. Mounting his trusty jeep he headed for the houses along the hills where the girls had begun their work. He certainly did much house-to-house work, inquiring of everyone ‘if they bought any anti-Catholic books from the American girls’ and, if so, telling them to “burn them!” This energetic field service on his part has done a lot to publicize the work. A friendly policeman said to the missionaries: “The priest never went around to visit the people, never. Now he’s everywhere —and it’s just because you’re here.” Telling of a leaflet the priest had published warning his “Dear brethren in Jesus Christ” of the “new sect” active among them and stating that ‘the demon knows the Bible by memory and recommends it to the people for free interpretation’, one of the missionaries writes: “The day after the leaflets were circulated we noticed everyone popping his head out of doors and windows to take a peek at us. We didn’t know what was the matter until one favorable storekeeper ran out after us to give us one of the leaflets. Only then did we realize that it wasn’t because our clothes were on wrong-side out or something.” One lady, not a Catholic, when visited by the priest and urged to burn her book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> informed the priest that instead she was going to keep and read it and pointed to the word “God&quot; in the title as being reason enough for doing so. When her husband came home and heard what the priest had done he was so angry that he made it a point to read the book also. When the missionaries returned to make their back-call they found the whole family so excited that they were all talking at the same time, trying to tell them how much they enjoyed the book, and so a study was easily started. They attended the next circuit assembly and now refer to themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses, and do indeed witness to their neighbors. So, nice work, Mr. Priest! Some twelve studies are now in progress with members of his flock who became quite interested as a result of his “Paul Revere” activity to warn them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our first taste of real opposition from official sources came during a circuit assembly in Bayam6n, near the capital. The mayor flatly refused permission to use the public plaza for our lecture on the weak excuse that the new plants and young trees might be damaged. We suspected that he was more concerned about the big Catholic church also planted solidly in the center of the plaza. After numerous interviews with this modern Pharaoh we decided to go ahead in spite of his refusal. The mayor angrily threatened immediate arrest, but when we paid a visit to the police station for a talk with the chief he showed quite a different attitude than the mayor. The chief said he had read of our court battles for freedom, and added, with a typical Latin gesture, that in his opinion the mayor’s vision and perspective along such lines extended no farther than the end of his nose! We gave the talk and 400 attended. Two city councilmen came up and hotly ordered the police to arrest us. They were quickly informed that Puerto Rico was still a free country ana that if the speaker had decided to speak from a soapbox out in the street then they, the policemen, would be out there directing traffic around him to avoid interference with the talk. They finished up by saying, “Take it to court if you want, but you might as well realize you’ll get beat, because these people know their rights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another question of rights involves one of our major problems: that of women who are interested in the truth but who have husbands who are not. The position of most Puerto Rican women is not like that of women in the United States. Invitations to go to meetings or in the service frequently bring replies such as, “But my husband never allows me to go out unless he goes with me”; “My husband is so jealous I can’t even go to the grocery alone”; “No, I couldn’t possibly go, I have to be here to serve my husband his food.” One said, “It's a carry-over from Spain; we are just slaves.” Nevertheless many women are realizing that their obligations before God are first in importance. One of the missionaries in Caguas writes of expressions she overheard while going to a district assembly with eleven women all packed in one car. The trip was only twenty miles but it was quite an event for most of them. One said, “Before I studied the Bible with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">americanas</span><span class="font5"> I never, never left the house. I was so nervous and afraid to meet people. Now I have gone to several assemblies.” Another, mother of six children, said, “I’ve never been anywhere before. I used to be Evangelical and went to a church nearby and that was all. But today my husband is keeping the children for me.” Such new-found freedom is a wonderful thing to them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Like to take a trip? Then come along with our brother over on the green little island of St. John (population 700) as he starts out Sunday morning to witness. First we climb into his boat and he rows the two miles across the bay to a point opposite East End. On shore now, another mile of walking and we’re at the humble home of our first study for this morning. Now the study’s over; ready to go? Three miles more of walking over hills and rocky roads, stopping for another study, and then we start up a high, steep hill. Our brother has heart trouble and is past sixty, but unless you push for all you’re worth he’ll leave you away behind. One hour of puffing and you’re on top of the hill looking down on blue Coral Bay. Our last study is held and then down the hill and back to the boat for an hour of rowing back to East End and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study which our brother conducts. A full day, and are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font5"> tired!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the British Virgin Islands, principal of which is the island of Tortola, were placed under the branch at Puerto Rico and arrangements were made to have a missionary visit and aid the little group of goodwill persons originally located by the brothers on the missionary boat “Sibia”. One sister especially has been working faithfully in caring for the Kingdom interests in this primitive little island. On the first night of the missionary’s initial visit he was asked to give an impromptu public lecture. The talk was given under a tree by lantern light and 45 persons quickly gathered around to hear. Among these meek, teachable persons there are many who are anxious to learn of the new world at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Fewer and fewer communications come through from Romania. During the past year some word </span><span class="font6">has reached certain friends, and some have come out of Romania and taken up residence in other countries. One sister was expelled from Romania in 1950, but she now finds it impossible to exchange correspondence with her own folks in Romania. Measures taken by the Romanian communistic government have become so severe now that anyone receiving mail in Romania from the West is put on the black list and is watched carefully. It is now reported that since May no one is allowed to leave Romania. Even in years before the Communists took over, false religion instigated much persecution against the witnesses of Jehovah; but now the persecution is worse. The present government of Romania considers the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as espionage in favor of the United States, and this has brought much suspicion upon all who are Jehovah’s witnesses. For one who has never experienced persecution and trouble and hatred of the government, it is almost impossible to imagine the terror that exists there. Even the members of families are unable to put confidence in other members of their own household. Freedom is absolutely gone. The people have become puppets of the master state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While our beloved brothers in Romania have always met with much opposition in that country, under the present atheistic government they are suffering even greater persecution. Yet we know that Satan’s power is absolutely no match for Jehovah’s might, and we can be confident that Jehovah will sustain all his people and give them a great measure of his holy spirit. Jehovah has said: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” and we know that Jehovah has placed his Son, Christ Jesus, in position to execute his judgments against those who are bringing harm to his “sheep” in the earth. Our brothers in Romania have an interest in our prayers, and we are happy to know that they have the truth and that they will continue on preaching the good news of the Kingdom, which is the only hope for all people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes Jehovah’s witnesses in various parts of the earth think that the darkness which covers the earth is darker where they are than in other parts of the world. The god of this system of things brings gross darkness on all the people but the call goes forth by the happy servants of God to come out of the darkened world. And the people of good will are getting out. Jehovah’s witnesses in Singapore have had another busy year of presenting the good news to the people, and a goodly number in Singapore and the Malay States have listened. Singapore is known as the crossroads of the world where the East and the West meet. Our brothers feel that every kind of religion has met there also and caused much confusion among the people. That is why the publishers rejoiced so much when the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font6"> came out, for they believe it is just the thing for their territory. There are two companies under the branch office at Singapore, and the territory over which the branch has jurisdiction finds it has 104 publishers as its peak. Excerpts which follow are very interesting, for they discuss the various problems the brothers have had to face during the year; and a very brief report is given on Borneo, which comes under this branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the emergency laws in this country, all publications coming into the colony are detained by the customs until they are examined and approved by the police department. Our consignment of the new book was held up and, to our great surprise, we received notification from the commissioner of police that the book would be prohibited importation into the colony. It seems that due to the religious riots staged by the Moslems some time ago, the police feared that the chapter on Islam might stir up anti-Moslem feelings. However, in order to get a ruling from a higher government level, the matter was referred to the colonial secretary’s department. From that office a letter was received upholding the decision of the police and directing us to arrange for transshipment of the consignment. In the meantime a letter of appeal had been sent to the colonial secretary showing reasons why the publication should be permitted circulation in this land. While we were experiencing difficulty in arranging transshipment, imagine our joy when word came from the colonial secretary’s office that “action will not be taken to exclude this book from the colony of Singapore”. A signal victory for true religion! With the aid of this wonderful instrument the work of liberating people of good will from spiritual bondage to false religion has gone on apace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Seventh-Day Adventist family living in K----, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">town about three hundred miles north of here, sent their son to the Adventist seminary in Singapore to further his education, both secular and religious. While living in the boarding school he read a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">and the articles in the magazine aroused his interest. He sent a subscription for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and inquired about other publications. He also expressed a desire to distribute tracts, as ‘he loved to share his faith with others’. By means of a home Bible study religious errors were replaced with Bible truth. During his school vacations he came to the Kingdom Hall for three studies weekly, each time bringing his friends from the seminary to the study. As his final term ends in December he has been taking advantage of his free time to get a better grasp of the truth in order to be able to carry on the work when he goes back home. Previously he had been canvassing for the Adventists in his native territory and had enrolled many students for a correspondence Bible course. Now he is sending them all theocratic literature, setting the prisoners free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As reported in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of January 1, the authorities in the Federation of Malaya refused to grant entry permits to four of our missionaries to work in Penang. Two other brothers were allowed a year’s stay in Kuala Lumpur, where a sister has been carrying on the work faithfully for a number of years. During the course of the year they met many people of good will toward God who manifested keen interest in the good news of God’s kingdom. Applications were made to the authorities for extension of their permits, but these were refused by the immigration department. An appeal to the chief secretary was also turned down. An appeal was considered by the executive council, but their attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses remained unchanged. Thus the two brothers had to leave the interested ones they had located and proceed on to Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The departure of the missionaries from the country brought a partial eclipse to the light of truth in this land which boasts the title “the land of sunshine”. However, as long as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines continued to reach the hundreds of subscribers behind the “rubber curtain” that much light continued to illuminate the path that leads to mankind’s only hope for peace and security, namely, God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, on May 29 the government of the Federation of Malaya, under the Emergency Regulations, banned the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> A weapon forged to fight godless communism was used to stifle Bible truth! Such arbitrary action of the government has puzzled many freedom-loving people in this land who cannot understand why Christian literature should be banned under the pretext of an emergency law. An appeal against this unjust ruling was made to the chief secretary, but was turned down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So in spite of opposition from both political and religious sources the work of liberating the prisoners has gone on. This is shown by the 21 per cent increase in average number of publishers over last year’s figure that we were privileged to attain. We rejoice also to report that four brothers saw the privilege of full-time service open to them and were enrolled as pioneers during the early part of the service year. Now they are enjoying many blessings in their daily ministry. With this manifest blessing of Jehovah upon his work in Singapore we look eagerly to the coming year and earnestly pray for his blessings to continue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>NORTH BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the isolated publishers were organized into a company. There have been three publishers preaching the good news in the town of Jesselton throughout the year. One of these is an elderly sister seventy-five years of age who conducts a regular home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A good-will person who has been studying the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> with me has shown keen interest in the truth. He was once barraged with questions by his fellow workers at his office about the ‘new religion’ he had joined. When relating the incident to me and the replies he gave for the course of action he had taken, he really amazed me. He showed he had made good use of the knowledge he had gained from his studies. He was able ‘to make a defense before everyone that demanded of him a reason for the hope in him’ even though we had gone through only part of the book. —1 Pet. 3: 15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only by calling back on those who have taken the literature, explaining the Bible and encouraging them to study can the mild-tempered ones be shown that salvation is not gained by mere profession of the name Christian or through some formalism. They are made to appreciate the words of the apostle Paul at Romans 10: 10 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(NW):</span><span class="font5"> “For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The 1952 service year was an outstanding one for South Africa. The event of principal importance was the erection of the Society’s new premises in the Germiston district which is not too far from Johannesburg. It was ready for occupancy by March and the members of the Bethel family moved in on April 1. The Society purchased the land and had a fine building constructed on it which will house the printing plant that will take care of the printing in many languages for all South Africa as far as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake! </span><span class="font6">and small publications are concerned. All large editions of books and booklets and the English </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> will be printed in Brooklyn as usual. The additional printing for South Africa required the installation of much new machinery, which was imported from Europe; and at the close of the year the new Bethel home was in fine shape, looking spick-and-span. The branch is all set now for increased production, and it is believed that the circulation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">in some of the South African languages will soon increase, because they will be printed in magazine form instead of being mimeographed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The field work in South Africa has moved ahead very steadily. Every one of the countries under the jurisdiction of the South African office shows an increase in number of publishers, and the report which follows has something to say about each of these countries—South Africa, Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Mauritius, South-West Africa, St. Helena and Swaziland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unassigned territory campaign was one of the high lights of the past service year. Although it was wintertime in this part of the earth, the weather is always dry over the greater part of the country during that season, and the publishers everywhere welcomed this opportunity of getting afield to search out the Lord Jesus’ other sheep in places not regularly worked. Some 437 small dorps were assigned, and practically all of these were served as well as the rurals in the neighborhood. A vast quantity of “seed” was sown and 10,000 names of persons of good will were sent in to the branch office. Now we are following through with the letters prepared at Brooklyn and sample copies of the magazines. Thousands and thousands of miles were covered to reach these people, and many joyful experiences were the lot of the publishers as they bid the prisoners “go forth”. Much of the territory was reached by auto (all kinds and in all conditions), but those who had no cars used train or bus. Some hitchhiked and others walked when no other transportation was available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some who could ill afford to take literature gladly took it after listening to the message and urged the witnesses to come again soon. Several said </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“totsiens” </span><span class="font5">with tears in their eyes after having the glorious hope of the new world instilled in their minds and hearts. A few experiences typical of the many received at the branch office will illustrate how Jehovah poured out his spirit upon his witnesses during this campaign. In one case 15 publishers in four cars traveled 100 miles to get to their territory. Magazines placed on the street Saturday morning totaled 584. The following morning 70 bound books were left in house-to-house work; 24 strangers attended the public meeting, and 36 good-will slips were sent in to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local clergyman at another place refused to accept the leaflet advertising the public meeting and later with some of his followers tried to break up the meeting. Two schoolteachers and 37 others refused to be intimidated, and at the conclusion of the talk expressed appreciation. However, there are exceptions to the rule. In one village a priest and his wife provided accommodations from Tuesday to Sunday for the circuit servant and gave their church house for all meetings and the public meeting on Sunday. They were pleased to give material food for the spiritual food they received in return. A Bible study was organized in their home. Another minister contacted in the rurals rang his church bell and summoned all the people in the neighborhood to come to listen to the public talk, which was held in his church building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A member of the Apostolic Church, anxious to know more about God’s kingdom, took the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> the latest book and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Now he is preaching God’s kingdom and his entire household is making good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the company chart that brought someone else into the truth. He was an elder in the Dutch Reformed Church. Like Nicodemus he came by night to inquire the meaning of all the red and black figures. The publisher inquired: “Do you not have a chart in your church?” The reply was, “No, only a collection book and enrollment.” Beginning with the title “Preach the Word”, the publisher went through all the columns giving him a full explanation of how Jehovah uses his visible organization to carry forward a real educational campaign. He remained from nine till midnight. A study was arranged and “Nicodemus” insisted that this be in the home of the publisher. After just a few weeks’ study he was convinced of the truth and took his stand. Asked by his brother elders as to why he had left them he replied: “To save my life. I have not been doing the will of God and wish to do so now.” He has subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> is now publishing and has intimated his desire to be baptized at the circuit assembly in October. This man had been 23 years in the service of the Dutch Reformed Church.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark262"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year the Society’s magazines in Portuguese have brought comfort and good cheer to the hearts of some of the Portuguese inhabitants of Angola. The books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font5"> and booklets in the Portuguese language have been much enjoyed and appreciated. We have reason to believe that one or two are spreading the Kingdom message as they have opportunity, but no regular reports are being received of any organized service work. Literature has been posted to them and apparently such is being distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Portuguese man who appreciates the literature wrote to us as follows: “I pray God to give more power to the witnesses of Jehovah that they may be moved by the holy spirit so that the whole world may know that God is true.” Another wrote: “Only now has it been possible for me to reply to your last letter, for which I thank you as well as for the books you sent me. Such are very precious to me and I cannot neglect to express much satisfaction at gaining a knowledge of the truth.” His letter then mentions that he has passed on some of the literature we sent him to his friends as we had suggested.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>BASUTOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work of liberating the prisoners progresses steadily in Basutoland. Though the ministers of false religion try all they can to prevent people from learning the truth, a number of good will persons have identified the voice of the Right Shepherd in the message now being proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses and are sharing with them in the clean worship of the Most High. Several new company organizations have been established during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief at Leribe to whom reference was made in the 1952 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> has now given instruction to the people in his district that they should take advantage of the Bible studies conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses. As a result the pioneer in that area can no longer handle the many Bible studies and has written for further assistance. The chief has made good progress with his own studies and has expressed the desire to attend the next circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The police have been helpful and kind. Permission was readily granted to a European district servant from the Union to serve the circuit assembly and this without restriction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only means of travel for many of the publishers in Basutoland is on foot, and in a mountainous country it is difficult getting around. However, the publishers are in good spirit and are overcoming the difficulties in their endeavors to let all know about the new world and its blessings. The brothers can climb the mountains, and that they are doing in order to reach the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>BECHUANALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom message is being preached the world over, even in the wilds of Bechuanaland, where it is making its mark on the hearts and minds of many of the simple people living in that country, almost entirely black-skinned Africans. True, there are only six areas where the work is being done, but it has a good foothold now and will expand into the other parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To understand the conditions under which the publishers work one must know something of the habits of the people, and particularly the system of governmental control exercised by the chiefs of the various tribes. The system is almost feudal. The chief wields terrific power over his subjects and can control almost their every movement. For the most part the average individual has little or no education; few can even read. Industry is almost unknown. A humble existence is eked out of the soil, which receives only five to nine inches of rain a year. It is a difficult task to keep alive, especially in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the pioneer ministers received lashes on two occasions. His cattle and other possessions were confiscated. Still he stood fast, and because of that he eventually had his possessions returned to him. Now when he refuses to leave his ministry work to work for the chief they threaten that his cattle will again be taken. Not deterred, he keeps on preaching. His cattle have not been touched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When interested ones are found in these villages and studies are begun with them, false shepherds come to warn that they will be reported to the chief and that they will lose their cattle. Many are fearful and stop studying. Others show less fear of men and they are blessed. They get peace of mind in the knowledge of the Kingdom and the blessings of the new world. So far, none of these stronghearted ones have lost their cattle. Still the threat remains, causing the hearts of many to fail them for fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other areas there is less opposition from the chiefs and the truth is spreading. Generally, the European commissioners and police are friendly to the preaching work. They have found that the truth does not incite to violence, rather that it brings happiness and peace and the great gain of ‘godliness with contentment’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark268"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>MAURITIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Two thirds of the 490,000 population of Mauritius are Indians, chiefly Hindus, and almost all the remainder are Creoles—a people of mixed blood, speaking a corrupt French and 95 per cent Roman Catholic. There are less than 10,000 white people, nearly all French Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the service year two missionaries had completed six weeks’ work in that isolated British island of the Indian ocean. There were two local men who had done some unorganized witnessing and these were being lined up for company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the missionaries have covered about one third of the built-up area of the island, namely, the villages of Curepipe, Vacoas, Quatre Bornes and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a few </span><span class="font5">small places. The three villages stretch out over seven miles and the countryside is so hilly that the bicycle often goes by train one way. Public transport ceases between 6 and 7 p.m. and, since the village is without street lights, evening meetings are difficult. Surface communications with the outside world are irregular; there was one gap of 24 months when no mail arrived, and so subscribers do not receive their magazines regularly. However, there is air mail twice a week. The priests are very vigilant, constantly collecting books, warning and threatening the people with excommunication, following the missionaries when they can find them and ferreting out all the information they can. Large numbers of people are illiterate and many read only Hindi, in which language no literature is available. No difficulties have been created by the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each of the missionaries conducts about twenty studies a month, nearly all in French. These are at Protestant homes mostly and thus the greatest response has come from just 2 per cent of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Curepipe a vigorous effort was made to gather the new interest into the home of one of them for talks and studies in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> and several very successful gatherings were held, including the Memorial. Mauritians, however, do not like to have other than intimate friends invited to their homes, and so </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> change appeared advisable. At Vacoas, a friendly Hindu schoolteacher was willing to permit the use of his school on Sundays. Starting in early May eight talks were given and a greater number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Tour de Garde</span><span class="font5"> studies conducted. Only persons known to be interested were invited by letter and these meetings have been well attended. Twice there were over forty present.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory known as South-West Africa is possibly one of few remaining countries in the world that little feel the full force of world distress. Its small European population feels secure in its isolation and wealth and pays little attention to events in other parts of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, this does not hold back the work of preaching by a small group of witnesses and the work goes steadily forward in the capital city Windhoek and to the northward. Much literature is still being placed and widely circulated in these towns, one missionary placing over 500 books in a seacoast town in one month. Money circulates freely and many seem glad to accept the “good” books, but the actual reading and studying of them is another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experiences well illustrate how Jehovah gives the increase from the scattered seeds of truth and how they find their way into good soil. A pioneer while working in a railway town made a practice of approaching the men going to and from work. When he approached one man with the literature, the latter recognized the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> which he had read. He said that the man who had given it to him did not want it but he had learned the truth through it. He was off duty that day, so the pioneer invited him to come and make some calls, which he did and enjoyed it very much. In this way a pubfisher was found in short order. He might never have been found if the pioneer had not seized every opportunity to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experience in similar vein emphasizes why we should try to give the literature as wide a circulation as possible. In this case it took fifteen years before one of the family took the books off the shelf where they had lain all that time and started to investigate them. During the year the branch office began to receive letters from an interested person living in a very isolated section near the edge of the Kalahari desert. He stated that he had become interested while reading some of the older publications, in this case </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font5"> in Afrikaans, and wished to share in the service. So the circuit servant made a visit, traveling by bus and train, and after a good walk he found the farm and an enthusiastic witness. It appears that as far back as 1936 his father had obtained a number of books and without particular attention put them on the shelf where they had remained little noticed until the son started to read them fifteen years later. The interested person, then only a boy but now a young man, had finished school and was now concerned with proper spiritual instruction. He had to look no farther than his father’s bookshelf! He started telling his family of the good things he learned. Shortly thereafter he began calling on the neighbors and he needed no introduction to field service, as he was already busy! All the members of his family circle now read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Die Wagtoring</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ontwaak!</span><span class="font5"> regularly. It certainly is a scattered and isolated territory on the border of the Kalahari desert, but even there it is beginning to blossom with Kingdom fruitage as the new publisher uses his strength to further the glad message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three missionaries and the small band of company publishers in South-West Africa are thankful to Jehovah for the increases he gives as they continue to search for and feed the Lord Jesus’ other sheep.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark271"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work on St. Helena has made splendid progress during the past year. The special pioneer who went there from the Union just before the end of the previous service year remained on the island throughout the year, and when he left there were few dry eyes. It was a year full of wholesome instruction for the brothers and for the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now there is one publisher for every 125 persons on the island. There were so many new publishers that on group rallies it was necessary for the pioneer to take three or four of the new ones with him to train them. Soon the need to have an additional unit was felt, and now there are two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soon after the arrival of this special pioneer on the island, he started a home Bible study with a family. The man showed good interest in the Bible and it was clear that he was taking in knowledge. Although invited to the company meetings they did not attend, but the study was continued. Then, during March, 1952, a one-day local assembly was arranged. This was something new to all the brothers because they had never previously attended or had any assembly. The man and his boy came along. That assembly actually gave them their first taste of the organization, and afterward the boy was heard making the remark: “It was not as if we were on St. Helena, but in another world.” Since then they have attended the meetings regularly and started to publish the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The parish priest heard about it and wanted to speak to the man, so this brother went to the priest’s house. The priest said to him: “Mr. ----, I heard you are in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">terested in religion.” Answer: “Yes, I am very much interested in religion, but only in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">clean</span><span class="font5"> religion.” So the priest commenced discussing Jehovah’s witnesses and their teachings and this brother defended them. He asked the priest: “Why did you never tell us that we can live forever in happiness on the earth?” The priest answered that that is impossible, because the earth is going to be burned up. This brother had his Bible and wanted to quote from the Revelation, but the priest interrupted and said, “Leave out the Revelation; it takes a better man than you to explain it.” Then the brother quoted from Psalm 37 and again the old priest had to defend himself by saying, “No, that is the Old Testament; say what Jesus said.” Well, this new publisher opened the Bible at Matthew 5: 5 and read it. Would the priest be convinced now? Of course not, because he answered, “Man, you just don’t understand that text,” and then wanted the publisher to leave. It was a very encouraging experience to this man; he could see that knowledge is a defense.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark272"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year Swaziland has experienced a very bad drought. The people have seen their rivers run dry and their crops die. They have seen their hopes for livelihood shattered and they now face serious famine conditions. In the midst of such conditions Jehovah’s witnesses have enjoyed the wonderful privilege of taking the waters of life to some who were hungry and thirsty for the Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prejudice and opposition due to lack of knowledge of our work are also being overcome. For example, one chief at first wanted nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses. He had read a tract published in America which had been given him by a clergyman, containing an attack on us. The circuit servant answered his questions; and when he discovered what we really believe and preach he sent for his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">indunas</span><span class="font5"> and religious leaders to come to listen to the talk, “Religion—True and False.” At the conclusion of the talk he expressed appreciation. The clergy were asked what they thought about it. They replied that they had nothing to say; it was all true. The chief then told them not to bring any more false stories to him about Jehovah’s witnesses. This chief is now having a Bible study with one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">We often hear the expression, ‘I wish Armageddon would come!’ But that is not in harmony with the true spirit of Jehovah’s witnesses. While all want to see Armageddon come, they do not want to see it come until the work is finished, that is, the work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth for a witness. The branch servant from Southern Rhodesia says they appreciate very much Jehovah’s mercy in allowing them to work during these years before Armageddon because they want to get the Kingdom message preached to as many persons as they can in Southern Rhodesia. A very satisfactory witness was given to all the races in this colony during the past year, and an excellent increase in average number of publishers, spending 18.2 hours in field service every month. The branch servant’s report is of real interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some countries unassigned territory must be almost nonexistent, but here vast areas have never seen a true minister of God carrying the light on God’s purposes to the people. The native brothers have walked and cycled to new territories and found a quick response to the truth. As a result we have many small, isolated groups of interested persons. The European publishers from Salisbury and Bulawayo have pushed out 80 miles from town and have had excellent results. One aspect of our work in unassigned territories must be unique to these African countries. Although most of the Europeans we met had never talked with a European witness, yet many have been employing native brothers for years. Knowing little of our beliefs, they have nevertheless appreciated the good effects that the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses has had on the native Africans. The company servant from Bulawayo writes about this: “Our company in harmony with others world-wide was given unassigned territory to work. It stretches 300 miles to the mighty Victoria Falls on the Northern Rhodesian border; 200 miles southward to link up with the Union of South Africa; a mere 65 miles to the Bech-uanaland Protectorate; 100 miles toward Salisbury and 300 miles eastward to Portuguese East Africa. What an assignment! As roads are very bad in places, time of publishers is limited, and fuel prices are high, we did not hope to get much of our assignment done. But with real effort and co-operation we have completed a 50-mile radius from our home base in Bulawayo. This constitutes the bulk of the populated area, and we hope to work the other portions soon with short vacations to the Game Reserve, Victoria Falls and other places at the extremities of our assignment. Our more than fifty publishers have all taken part on different occasions, with as many as seven parties out at once. We have had some grand experiences as well as slight opposition and have witnessed to farmers, ranchers, small workers in gold, scheelite and other minerals, week-end country dwellers, native reserve officials and many other folk who live their lives far from the towns and villages. On many occasions we have found that our work among the Europeans has been made easier by the fact that many employed our African brothers and these had attempted to witness to their white employers. The African witnesses’ good conduct and reliable service had so impressed their ‘bosses’ that we have had a wonderful reception given to us on occasions. One experience is worth recording. On a small gold mine many miles off the beaten track were two houses. At the first house four books and some magazines were placed and at the second three books, some magazines and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font5"> The lady told us that her houseboy who had been with the family for seven years was a witness of Jehovah, and since they had moved to the mine a few months ago he had interested 37 other ‘boys’ in our work!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This rapid growth of the work among the natives has, of course, annoyed some of the native religious leaders, but it has also impressed some of the humbler ones. For example, a member of the African Methodist Church asked his friend (one of Jehovah’s witnesses) why he did not preach such good news at his Methodist church. The brother sought the advice of the circuit servant, who said it would be all right. So an arrangement was made for the circuit servant to give his public talk at the church and follow it with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">study. On that Sunday the publishers worked the territory around the church and invited people to attend. The regular minister acted as chairman and invited the people to give ear to the talk. After the talk and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study he said: “Ah ha, since I was born I never heard a good gospel like this.” He suggested that the people take the literature, and he invited us to come every Sunday for a Bible study. We arranged a back-call in the church, for some of the women wanted to become Jehovah’s witnesses there and then.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problem of illiteracy is being tackled in this country. For four years now the companies have been running reading and writing schools in place of the theocratic ministry schools. Last year about 80 per cent of the companies were conducting biweekly classes for the illiterate brothers and sisters. And now 60 per cent of the native publishers can read and write in one of the native languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark275"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark276"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the many far-flung outposts of Jehovah’s organization is in Surinam, in the northern part </span><span class="font6">of South America. It certainly is good to see an increase in number of publishers again, a 30 per cent increase. For some time now it has been difficult to get the people there interested. But by the steady preaching of the good news the brothers have gotten the people to listen, and some of them are now taking their stand. When the brothers put on circuit assemblies they are just as enthusiastic about them as are the brothers in other parts of the world. The branch servant sends us some very interesting items about the country, and some of them are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the last service year you remember we were busy making arrangements for a circuit assembly to be held in Meerzorg, just across the river from Paramaribo. A brother who lives there gave us a part of his fruit farm as an assembly ground. Wooden benches were set up in the shade of the orange and mango trees, and the assembly got under way. On Sunday morning everybody, big and little (with the exception of two who were sick), went out in the field service, leaving the assembly site almost entirely deserted. Four persons were immersed at that assembly, a good beginning for a good year. As the curtains of night fell over the farm, homemade oil-burning wick lamps were set up on bamboo poles; when lighted they transformed the place into a tropic wonderland, casting at the same time brief, flickering glances at the semicircle of intent and lively faces. On Sunday evening their gleams betrayed the fact that Javanese. Hindustani, Surinamers and one or two sun-browned whites were present. A start had been made in helping us all to become more mature publishers and servants: our goal for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the assembly the days sped swiftly by. Much time was taken up in trying to get entry permits for the four missionaries assigned to Surinam, and finally they were received for three of them. We are still trying to get the fourth one in. In January the first two, a married couple, arrived; and in February the third came, a single sister. But where would we put them? Our old house was far too small, and the housing shortage was terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new hall was urgently needed in order to make room for more at the meetings. Finally, not more than two weeks before the arrival of the first pair of missionaries, a man of good will, a salesman, found a place for us, large enough for both home and hall combined! Well, in poured enthusiastic brothers, equipped with wrecking bars, hammers, saws and energy. Walls were torn down to make a larger hall, existing pillars were pleasingly altered to modem form, and in course of time walls and ceiling of much of the new portion were covered with three-ply wood. Then came the painters, who did much work to beautify the hall. When they were finished the hall looked much better. Groups of sisters also swept in, equipped with the implements of their craft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So now we have a new home, a new hall, and three new missionaries. At the end of the service year one of the missionaries had to leave Surinam. About two years ago he had contracted filaria. Since that time he had treated it regularly and kept his leg always bandaged to prevent it from swelling too much. But at last he decided that it was best for him to leave the tropics. His going left us still shorthanded for the work here in the city; so we hope we can get some more in here sometime soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Along in March we received the Hollandish translation of the letter to all publishers concerning the need for maturity and stressing the company book-study arrangement. We got it into the hands of the publishers as quickly as we could, really emphasizing it in the service meetings. That letter surely hit the nail on the head, and it paved the way for a very theocratic and upbuilding circuit assembly in April, wherein the suggestions given were stressed and pounded home as never before. In addition the need for holding personal territory and working it was pointed out. There many began to really get a vision of the Theocracy and of the advisability and practicability of following the simple, easily-understood counsel of the Society. From that time on so much witnessing has been done it has become difficult to keep a territory map in the file. Now we need a new master map and smaller individual territories. These things are now being worked on. Also the company Bible-study arrangement has never been so sound. The company servant and Bible study servant are now both free to go from study to study as an example of activity and as an encouragement and help toward maturity. Attendance at these studies has shot up, and witnessing work carried on before the study is being better supported. Later we hope to start midweek group witnessing from the study points. It is coming along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another very encouraging thing is that the local company publishers are coming into their own in the servant body. More and more they are proving their willingness to work wherever they are assigned and to do the work the best they possibly can. Many promising brothers in the company have been assigned to work with the others as assistants, and this will make for an even stronger servant organization in the future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark277"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures tell us we should give Caesar’s things to Caesar and pay to God that which belongs to him; but nowhere in the Scriptures does it tell us that one should give everything to the state or that he is the state’s property. Last year a Swedish court took a child away from its mother because she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This called forth many protests from the general public. In the columns of one of the prominent Stockholm papers this statement was made: “The mother believes in a god who in time is going to take over the rule of this earth. For that reason, she is considered unfit to care for her child. If she were of the belief that Stalin would be able to exercise such rule or that the Americans would do so, then no one would oppose her.” God and his Word are not given much consideration in Sweden, either by the people or by the government and clergy. So there is an urgent need for Jehovah’s witnesses to keep busy in that land. They are keeping busy, and we are happy to report that there are now 5,077 regular witnesses of Jehovah proclaiming the message of the Kingdom every month. There is still a large amount of work to be done, and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, our Swedish brothers and sisters are pressing on diligently, doing the work. Happily they go forward in unity with other servants of God. The branch servant gives us some of these things to think about in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah’s witnesses do zealously strive to interest people in the Bible message and teach them the life-giving truths therefrom, both state church priests and the so-called free church pastors and preachers join in efforts to warn the people against these witnesses, often arranging “protest meetings”. Some of their number, however, do not think that such a procedure will accomplish anything. As one of them wrote in a religious periodical: “Jehovah’s witnesses may feel secure so long as we gather in protest meetings in the church buildings. But on the day when we start going out into the streets, not to protest against another religious group, but to win people for God, then maybe Jehovah’s witnesses would start to feel concerned about their future.” There is, however, no prospect of such a thing happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new law governing religious freedom, which became valid January 1, for the first time granted Swedish citizens the right to leave the State Church without having to join another government-recognized religious body. Much to the surprise of the civil authorities, there were, however, proportionately very few who took advantage of this opportunity, and by far the greatest number of those who did were Jehovah’s witnesses. Their visits to the parish priests’ offices in this matter did afford these witnesses many fine occasions to witness to the Kingdom. In several cases the priests procured literature and even attended studies as a result of these interviews in order to find out more about our beliefs. The Bible tracts which appeared in Swedish just at that time came in very handy in this connection. One priest got so interested that the old sister, who constitutes the company in that village, has had weekly studies with him in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> ever since; and he told a visiting pioneer brother that he was glad that she is calling regularly and keeping him at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most people in Sweden, although professing Christianity, do not believe in the Bible but are awe-struck by the accomplishments of science and swallow everything served from that table, such as the evolution theory. Hence we were very glad to have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font5">booklet in the Swedish language, and it has awakened real interest. In just three months no less than 91,000-odd copies have been shipped out of our stockroom. Besides the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?</span><span class="font5"> which was released at the convention in September by Brother Knorr, we have also had the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?</span><span class="font5"> not to speak of the new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Songbook,</span><span class="font5"> which the brothers at the Brooklyn factory worked so hard to bring out in time for our assemblies this year, to the pleasant surprise and joy of all the assembled 4,378 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At these assemblies many interesting experiences from the work in unassigned territories were told. A small party of publishers went by motorboat to an island and arranged for a public lecture which was given from the boat on Sunday morning while the people gathered ashore to listen. The brothers in the boat observed another boat going out and then stopping at a distance while the lecture went on. Afterward it came near and the man in it turned out to be the local priest who stated he had told those who came to listen at the church that they ought to go to the shore and hear the lecture given there instead. Now, however, he was wondering if the brothers would not agree, when next they would come there, to advise him beforehand so that they could make their services fall at different hours and thus permit all to attend at both places if they wished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One company servant, who served for two months in such territory as a vacation pioneer, in that time got five persons out with him in the field work. Another brother came across an old hut which looked like a place where wood is kept for fuel; but there happened to be a fair-sized window on it, so he stepped inside. It was a stock of wood all right, but behind the wood a room had been arranged where an old man lived. He was very glad that a witness called, and stated there had been none for twelve years. The brother objected that it could not be that long ago, but the man said: “It must be at least eight, because I have been blind for that many years, and last time a witness called here I could see and got some books to read.” Now the publisher was glad for the privilege of helping him to learn more of the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society has a very fine Bethel home and factory at Berne, Switzerland. Here our brothers produce magazines, books, booklets, tracts and other necessary printed matter for carrying on the work in a number of European countries. Sixty-eight per cent of the 2,058,368 magazines printed at Berne were shipped out of the country, and of the 454,854 books and booklets manufactured there, 52 per cent were sent out of Switzerland. The branch servant sends in an interesting report, and parts of it are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first three months of the service year produced successive new peaks, and in April we surpassed the 3,000 mark for the first time with the all-time peak of 3,011 publishers. The average number of publishers increased 12 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The main event of the year’s gospel-preaching was the work in the “unassigned territory”. Many were the joyful reports received from the companies during the campaign, often expressing surprise at how well the work had gone despite the isolated nature of the territory and religious prejudice. In this land it was necessary to travel mostly by train or bus to reach the territory, because comparatively few publishers own cars. Nevertheless, we had letters which said: “The service in our territory surprised us, for we had much success in this hard Catholic territory and about twenty books were placed. We thank Jehovah for his goodness and rich blessing.” The ‘false shepherds’ were not slow in showing their opposition to this ‘invasion’ of their pastures. They caused articles of warning to appear in the Catholic press with headings such as: “Warning! The so-called Jehovah’s witnesses are at work!” From the pulpits they read diocesan circular letters warning their ‘flock’ to take no literature or to burn it and to denounce the publishers to the police. In one village fifty Catholic youths went from house to house collecting all the literature that had been left. In some places the publishers were threatened and physically attacked, and in many places the police under clerical pressure sought to stop the work and confiscated the literature. But some hearing ears were found. One publisher reports how a man called the police after being witnessed to, and complained against our work. The policeman’s answer was: “You leave these people alone to quietly continue their work; they know the law better than we do, and know just what they can do and cannot do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year once again produced its crop of police interference with the preaching work, mostly on charges of peddling or disturbing the Sunday peace. The work in the predominantly Catholic “unassigned territory” provided its share of legal fights. In all, 62 cases were reported to the office and five cases came before the courts. A case from the previous year produced one of our first victories when the district court of Aarau on October 17, 1951, rendered judgment dismissing a charge of peddling arising out of a circuit assembly. The court ruled: “The peddling law has no application to the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, . . . for the aim and purpose of their activity is not to have commercial gain but to distribute their Biblical ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The peddling issue fight continued in Canton Vaud where as the previous year closed we had an Appeal Court and Swiss Supreme Court decision against us. In rapid-fire succession the battle has gone on. On September 3, 1951, the fight opened before the district court of Lausanne when a pioneer stood charged with peddling. Amazingly enough, accepting our defense, the court dismissed the case and stated that it found the superior court’s rulings to be unsatisfactory. The state attorney did not appeal! March 27, 1952, another case came before the district court of Aigle, where Judge de Haller sat who twice previously had ruled in our favor only to be overruled by the supreme court. What would the judge now do in this new pioneer case? In a clear-cut judgment he ruled that the pioneer was no peddler, but an evangelist interested not in gain but in preaching the gospel. The state attorney again did not appeal! Then came June 30, 1952, with the district court of Rolle ruling that a company publisher was no peddler. This time the state attorney appealed and on August 20, 1952, the appeal court again for the third time faced this question. This court accepts only written pleas of appeal, no oral argument. Hiding behind the ruling of the supreme court the appeal court ruled against us, seeing no reason to change their views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canton Solothurn, strongly Catholic, has presented a similar fight on the peddling issue. Last year, although the appeal court had ruled against us, a district court ruled in our favor. On appeal by the police this case was again turned against us by the appeal court. Then July 25, 1952, a pioneer came before the district court of Balsthal where the judge, a devout Catholic, expressed his surprise that we still fought in view of the decisions against us. After hearing the case argued, he finally ruled in our favor. Again the police appealed, and as this report is closed on September 18, 1952, the appeal court of Canton Solothurn faced its third appeal. Our lawyer, a Swiss member of Parliament, ably argued the case showing the work of Jehovah’s witnesses to be conducted without purpose of gain but solely for the spreading of the gospel. The witness was no peddler. The lawyer invited the court’s three judges, two being Catholic, to forsake their established former rulings and declare Jehovah’s witnesses to be free of the peddling law. After thirty minutes’ deliberation the president announced the judgment in favor of the pioneer and the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as not liable to the peddling law. Yet another victory!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark280"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The country of Thailand is a most interesting place. The main religion of the people is Buddhism, but they are willing to listen, to study, and to take in knowledge. Some of them are changing their minds now as to their former beliefs and are turning to God’s Word, the Bible. It certainly is interesting to see the fine increase in number of publishers this year in Thailand compared with the previous year. Now there are 132 publishers regularly engaging in the field service each month, to compare with 103 previously. Great assistance has been given to the new interest in Thailand through the many missionaries we have sent into the country. The brothers have their circuit assemblies, public meetings and house-to-house work just as Jehovah’s witnesses do in any other country, and they meet similar problems and opposition, but like our brothers in other countries they are determined to preach the good news, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. They are happy doing this. In Thailand many are hearing the call for the prisoners to come forth, and many are coming. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences.</span></p><img src="yb1953_E_files/yb1953_E-12.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:96pt;">
<p><span class="font5">The full-time service offers many blessings to those engaged therein, and following is an account of an experience enjoyed by two of our special pioneers working in the south. “In one of the small towns south of Bangkok, we called on a young girl who had her own dressmaking shop. She was Buddhist and had no desire to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">change her religion. She was offered the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font5"> but did not take it until one or two strong points of interest were brought to her attention. We called back on her again but found that she had not had time to read the book. Two more back-calls were made on her, and the second time we persuaded her to take time off from her sewing to read a few paragraphs. This aroused her curiosity, and she readily agreed to have a regular Bible study with us every week. It was not long before she began attending the company meetings and, despite opposition from her family and friends, she remained firm in her determination to acquire accurate knowledge of God. After three months she began to publish, and at the end of six months she had entered the full-time service. However, she soon found the town too small and asked permission to come to Bangkok, as she desired wider scope for her work and also closer contact with the organization. This was readily granted, and she closed her shop to come to Bangkok, where she is now enthusiastically telling the people the good news of the Kingdom which caused her to change from being a sewer of dresses to ‘a sower of the Word of God’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of freeing the “prisoners” in Thailand does not go forward without opposition, and the following experience of the circuit servant, Brother Gruber, well illustrates this. During the past service year he paid a visit to a special pioneer brother who had been assigned to work in Chiengrai, a town near the Burmese border in Northern Thailand. Plans had been made to hold a public lecture, so the brothers contacted the secretary of the municipality and asked for use of the children’s public playground. However, they were told they must first see the governor; and when they did call on that gentleman he seemed very reluctant to grant their request, for he said he had had much trouble following a lecture given by one of our brothers on his last visit. Apparently some prejudiced persons reported that a considerable amount of politics had been discussed at this lecture, but after assuring him that God’s kingdom was the only government they were interested in, he finally agreed to let them have the playground. Hardly an hour had passed when the secretary came to them saying he had been threatened by the police with arrest if he allowed the talk to be held. This meant a return visit to the governor, who informed them no lectures could now be given in public. They then asked permission to use a school or private house, and he gave his consent. Thereupon arrangements were made to use a hotel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and compound kindly offered by an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscriber. Next day, however, he too came and told the brothers he had been likewise warned by the police. The governor then sent word that he wished to see our brothers; and on their arriving at his office he informed them that no lectures were now being permitted in places other than a religious building, and suggested they get in touch with the Presbyterian Church and ask them for the use of one of their buildings. The brothers knew it would be useless, but nevertheless they did request permission from the head of the American Presbyterian Mission and were not at all surprised when they were flatly turned down. The only other prospect was a Buddhist temple, so the head of the Buddhist Association was contacted and he cordially received the brothers and gave them a written statement allowing them the use of any one of the temples or “wats”, while at the same time he recommended the Wat Klang Wieng, as it was the most centrally located. On Sunday morning the brothers went around to some of the temples and invited the priests to attend the lecture to be given later that same day. Rumors were circulating that everyone who attended would be arrested, but, regardless, many of the townspeople as well as thirty priests and several policemen began filing into the temple as the lecture commenced. Seated in the audience were several Presbyterian “Christians” busily taking notes and talking in a loud voice to one another in an effort to distract the attention of the listeners. However, they apparently became interested in what the speaker was saying, for they soon became silent. About halfway through the talk in rushed the governor shouting at the top of his voice to everyone to remain where he was and then ordering the police to take down the names of all those present. The priests were ordered to leave, and soon there were only a few children present, so Brother Gruber brought his talk to a close. Afterward, many persons were overheard saying they were thoroughly disgusted with the action taken by the governor; and yet, one might ask, did he act entirely on his own initiative, or was he perhaps persuaded to take such action by the so-called “Christians” who hate the light of truth which exposes them as false shepherds? In time those who truly love truth and righteousness will recognize these false guides for what they really are and will leave them to fall into the ditch of destruction while they themselves tread the path that leads to life in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year the branch reported eight missionaries working in this country, but even as this report is being compiled three more missionaries have arrived, bringing the total number to 25. Besides this three new missionary homes were opened during the year, so that now there is a total of five homes operating in Thailand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The government of Turkey does not extend freedom of religion to all denominations. It is principally a Moslem country. It has been difficult for our brothers in Turkey to carry on the preaching of the good news, because it is forbidden to go from door to door and persuade people to believe in God’s Word if they are of any other religion. It is difficult, therefore, to carry out his command and to stand up against the government. However, the servants of the Most High God know that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached, and therefore they put forth every effort to help those who are seeking truth and righteousness from the Word of Jehovah to understand it. Many Bible studies are conducted in Turkey, and thousands of back-calls have been made during the year. Much time has been spent in preaching to people who want to know the truth of what God’s Word has to say. The brother who is in charge of the work in Turkey gives us a few interesting experiences. We feel sure that those who remain in Turkey will continue to faithfully serve Jehovah, aiding the other sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the very beginning of the service year our main objective was to assist the local brothers in becoming mature publishers. In addition to stressing the importance of theocratic organization, return calls and home Bible studies were repeatedly emphasized. These two important features of the work had been more or less neglected prior thereto in favor of merely reporting figures which were highly inflated. But in a short while the local brothers began to appreciate the value of home Bible studies, and they began to share in cultivating “the right kind of soil” through return calls and studies. As each month passed by, the steady progress in these features of service was observed. This, too, made for more hours in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s evening meal was successfully celebrated at two private homes without interference, with 66 in attendance and one partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a call on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Russian gentleman who has been a cripple since the Russian revolution, I met a Russian lady, a Circassian, who is of the Moslem religion. The gentleman had told her much about the Bible study we were having together, and she was very curious to attend. She had many questions and asked me to visit her at her own house, which I did. She then told me that although born a Moslem she had attended a Christian Orthodox school for the high society youth in Petersburg and thus was somewhat familiar with Christian doctrine and worship. She said she loved our Christ very much, and I had the privilege of explaining to her why our Christ and his heavenly Father are so lovable. We studied the chapter on the ransom, which pleased her very much because she was of the opinion that there was absolutely no hope for us as sinners to receive forgiveness and everlasting life. She asked me to bring her a Bible, which she has been reading very enthusiastically ever since, and we have been having our Bible study every week. With much patience and Jehovah’s blessing this prisoner will soon be freed from her ignorance and religious superstition and will enter into the true Christian freedom which only the truth can give. This experience proves new interest is being found and these interested ones are being fed with Kingdom truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark282"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The good news of God’s kingdom still goes forward in Uruguay by the efforts of the persistent preachers of the good news. Jehovah’s witnesses have enjoyed a 14 per cent increase in number of publishers engaged in field service every month. They have striven for maturity as in all Latin-American countries, but it takes time to teach and properly instruct the new interest. Those who attend our meetings regularly and enjoy the fellowship of those thoroughly grounded in the truth gain in maturity much more quickly than those who neglect the attending of meetings. In Uruguay the brothers have been slow to develop capable public speakers. However, the effort has been made and the training is being given, but maturity takes time. Assisting the brothers in going from door to door is one thing, but getting brothers up before an audience to speak for a whole hour is another. Yet by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, every effort will be made to aid in this direction. There are now 605 publishers, a new peak for Uruguay, who are going about happily preaching the good news of the Kingdom. The branch servant writes about some nice experiences that have taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few of those who are now publishing came into the truth in a comparatively short time. During an assembly a publisher from out of town who was doing street magazine work met an interested woman. She had heard that Jehovah’s witnesses distributed Bibles. She was directed to the assembly hall to get her Bible, and while there she became interested in the work. Her name was turned in as a person of good will, and a missionary was able to start a Bible study with her after the assembly. Within a month she was publishing, and is so enthusiastic that she has interested others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same assembly a visiting brother witnessed to a Catholic nurse who had just returned home from mass. For some time she had been rather doubtful about the church and curious about the Bible. He turned in her name as of good will and after a year’s study another assembly saw her baptized and publishing. Now she is just as active as a witness as she was before as a member of the Catholic Action and the Daughters of Mary Club. She resigned from these two associations and has been witnessing in the hospital clinic during her spare time and doing a thorough job of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first day that two missionaries arrived in Uruguay they met a Christian Science lady at the third or fourth house to whom they endeavored to witness in Spanish. This lady took a book and accepted the suggestion that a Bible study be held in her home. After a number of studies she became very sick and the studies were stopped. The missionaries could not contact her any more, as they were assigned to other territory. But later on a new unit was formed and her name was turned over to it. But even before she could be assisted again with a study somebody called on her from the unit with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Upon hearing that the new Kingdom Hall was close to her house, she started immediately to associate there. Later on she admitted to the local publishers that she had not understood much of what the missionaries had said, due to their lack of fluency in the language. But she knew by their sincerity and special effort that whatever they had must be something good. All of this happened without the knowledge of the two original missionaries. Now what a surprise one of them received! Upon visiting the unit as circuit servant he found out that this lady was one of the good publishers in the unit. He could appreciate that sincere effort will overcome the language barrier, and that those who want to know the truth will not permit even a language to stop them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since Jehovah’s witnesses in Montevideo are becoming well known for placing Bibles, another lady approached a publisher on the street asking for one. The alert publisher took her name and address to personally deliver the Bible. On delivery she did not stop with placing the Bible but also left a bound book and began a Bible study. Three months later the Memorial celebration offered the opportunity to invite her to the hall. Since then she has seldom missed any company meetings, and within six months she proved herself apt to publish the message and continues to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year has certainly been one of maturity for us. We have not increased in number of publishers as much as in other years. But in times past many had associated with us, and although they did go from house to house they never gave a thorough witness. It was mostly because they were not attending the service meetings. Now we have been spending more time with those who have enough appreciation to come to the meetings and have been helping them to become mature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most progressive countries in South America is Venezuela. Outstanding changes have been made in the principal city, Caracas, as far as buildings are concerned. New office and apartment structures are springing up all over the place, old houses are being tom down, new streets are being built and old ones widened, and schools and hospitals are being constructed for the benefit of the people. Venezuela is a prosperous country. But while the country is prosperous in its way, Jehovah’s organization has gained prosperity too, because his blessing is upon his people. Good progress has been made during the year in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses there are very happy because they are able to give of the truth to others; until now they have 564 regular publishers in the field every month. This is a 19 per cent increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six years ago Jehovah’s witnesses were almost unknown in Venezuela. When the Society established a branch in 1946 there was an average of only 13 publishers in the country. But the publishers worked hard in the field; so now as this service year ends we are happy to report the average of 564 publishers, with a peak of 662. This was a 19 per cent increase over last year’s report, most of the increase in Venezuela being in the two units in Caracas. They are progressing very well, and it will soon be necessary to divide them again. All together in the two units there are 70 brothers enrolled in the theocratic ministry school; therefore each unit is guaranteed a good supply of speakers. During the past few years it has been possible to have public talks given regularly in the Kingdom Halls, using local speakers. The brothers do very well in preparing their talks and deliver them with real enthusiasm. The Memorial attendance was good this year and the total report read 1,289, to compare with last year’s 901. Many persons of good will came out and took their stand, and the total baptized was 107.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year maturity has been stressed by all the servants in the country. Another point that was forcefully brought out was the need of keeping the organization clean. These two points were the main themes at the assemblies and many of the service meetings. The increase was not so great as other years, but we believe that the brothers in Venezuela are more mature and are living clean lives in harmony with the Society’s instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maturin is the capital of the state of Monagas, and in this city there is one isolated publisher. The circuit servant arranged to spend a few days with this publisher and to give a public talk. First he called at the police station and then on the owner of a theater. He explained his purpose and the work that he was doing. He obtained permission to use the theater free and then set to work passing out handbills advertising the talk. The next day he was happy to count 149 persons in the theater, and the talk was a great success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Santa Barbara is another village nearby in the oil field district. A publisher in El Tigre, a company about 200 miles away, heard that the circuit servant would pass through this village. Since he had many friends in Santa Barbara, he went to this village and arranged for a public talk in a private home. He invited all his friends by word of mouth and to his surprise and joy 52 came to hear the circuit servant’s talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experience from the other side of the country near the Colombian border occurred in a city called Rubio, where there is one new publisher that is just getting started in the service. One morning the circuit servant and the new publisher were working some rurals near the town. After presenting the three-book offer, the owner of the farm said he could not read Spanish, as he was Swiss. “But you can explain to my wife, as she likes the Bible,” he said; so they explained it to her. She then called her mother, an 81-year-old lady. When she saw the books she asked If this work was connected with the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Plan of the Ages.</span><span class="font5"> After we said yes, her eyes brightened up and she became excited. She then asked, “You mean you know about Mr. Rutherford?” Her daughter was translating for her into Spanish, as she spoke only German. After they informed her that this was the same work she went into the house and brought out the book she had been reading over and over for many years along with the pictures of Brother Rutherford and Brother Russell. She said she had been reading the book since 1920 and had seen the “Photodrama of Creation” and had heard the talk “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Twelve years ago she had come to Venezuela and lost contact with the witnesses. She said, “I’ve missed you people very, very much.” She seemed to be extremely happy. The publishers explained to her the latest progress in the preaching work, and her daughter said that she used to go in the service every Sunday. The circuit servant sang several songs from the Kingdom Songbook to see if she would recognize them, and she did. The new publisher from Rubio who was with the circuit servant was thrilled with the experience and commented that Jehovah’s spirit had led them to this farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Spiritual maturity does not come automatically but all must work and study to gain it. The publishers in Venezuela have maturity on their mind. We hope and pray that Jehovah will continue to bless the work in this land all to the honor and glory of his great name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark284"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, progress and increase are found in the country of Yugoslavia. There have been constant difficulties there because of the interference of the governmental authorities and the religious organizations. It is difficult also to keep the brothers supplied with spiritual food, but by some arrangement the good news of the Kingdom continues to reach them, and they study what is in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> The brothers are growing in faith and fearlessness, and their faith is strong as they go forward in the fight for pure worship of the Most High, Jehovah. As our brothers in Yugoslavia enter the new service year, they will do their best to advance Kingdom interests in that country and will follow Jehovah’s instructions as they find them in his Word to proclaim the good news in all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some experiences follow, and it is good to report that there has been an excellent increase in number of witnesses in Yugoslavia; however, we are not publishing the number of Jehovah’s witnesses in this country, because it would only bring persecution and a tracking down of the brothers by the government if they knew. Jehovah’s witnesses are doing no harm to the government of Yugoslavia nor to any other government. They are good Christians and preach the best message in the world, comfort to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are very happy to see that Jehovah has blessed our efforts although we have been lacking literature. We have endeavored to preach by word of mouth, following in this the example of Christ Jesus and the early church. The results show that we have found many hearing ears eager to learn of Jehovah’s purposes, to accept the invitation to “come” and “take life’s water free” and to obey the command to “go forth” from doomed Babylon and come to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy has made great efforts to stop Jehovah’s work. He has made it easy for himself to interfere. There is still the system of a spy for every house and every street to watch the people and their movements. It truly is as the psalmist says: “They have prepared a net for my steps; . . . they have digged a pit before me”; but we are glad to know that soon the tables will be turned and we shall see that “they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves”. (Ps. 57:6, AS) Their system is in truth like one big net spread all over the country in which to catch Jehovah’s servants and make an end to the praises sung to his name. But Jehovah’s kingdom will yet rule all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While two of the three brothers who received life sentences in February 1947 have been released in the course of the past service year after nearly six years in concentration camp and penitentiary, one wonders why on the other hand arrests and prosecution continue. This is particularly the case in Slovenia, where Catholic influence is the strongest and where many of Jehovah’s people are under the surveillance of the police and their agents for the purpose of catching them when studying God’s Word. But the brothers have shown that they are determined to defeat the purpose of the persecution, obeying God rather than man. In the course of the year several brothers have been sentenced to varying terms in prison. The last trial took place in Ljubljana in August when five publishers were sentenced to from one to five years’ imprisonment. At the end of the service year 32 brothers were serving terms in jail. Loving these brothers as themselves, those outside the prison walls have never failed to help those inside, regularly providing additional food for them every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nature of the charges brought against the brothers has not changed much since the establishment of the present regime, except that, since the United States and Yugoslavia are co-operating now in the economic and military domain, it is impossible to accuse the brothers of espionage in favor of America. But the authorities still work under the misconception that Jehovah’s witnesses are enemies of the communistic state and working at its overthrow. This wrong idea is, however, gradually overcome as more and more of the representatives of the state when questioning our brothers hear their “pure language” testimony about the one and only hope for mankind, Jehovah’s kingdom. While the majority of the officers and judges maintain their unreasonable charges against Jehovah’s people, some begin to recognize the sincerity, truthfulness and integrity of our brothers. Here is an example in point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister held a home Bible study with a few persons. These were not aware that in an adjacent room of another flat secret agents were listening in through the thin wall. They did this several evenings and then arrested the group, but after questioning them all held only the sister for examination and trial. The official examining her told her she would be “liquidated”, even suggesting that she commit suicide to end her troubles. Before being brought to trial she prayed fervently to Jehovah that she might have an opportunity to give a witness. Her prayer was answered, for the president of the court addressing her said: “I wish to hear from you who Jehovah’s witnesses are and what they do.” Without interruption, except a question asked now and then, the sister was able to speak for three and a half hours. Her witness did not fail to impress the judges, and while she was not acquitted she was sentenced to only three months in prison. We say “only” because in similar circumstances sentences have been much longer. After she was released she told the brothers how intensely happy she felt while speaking to the honor of Jehovah’s name and how she experienced the peace of God “that excels all thought”.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark285"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark286"></a>WHAT HAVE YOUR WORKS BEEN?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">“And he will render to each one according to his works: everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good; however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and anger, tribulation and distress, upon the soul of every man who works what is injurious.” (Rom. 2:6-9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> We have seen from the report in this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> a partial fulfillment of this promise. Jehovah God certainly will render to each one according to his works. Those who have done good are on the way to everlasting life. They are pleasing to Jehovah God. They are gaining in maturity and bringing joy and gladness to their fellow man; they are happy in giving the truth to others. These brothers Eire lining up with their fellow witnesses world-wide and worshiping Jehovah in holy array.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand, when reading this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font6">we saw that some had fallen by the wayside and were no longer walking with Jehovah’s witnesses. Why? They made the big mistake of disobeying the truth. If they had obeyed the truth, that is, turned to Jehovah’s Word, accepted it for what it said and carried out the righteous instructions of Jehovah, they would still be in his organization. They would still be gaining greater knowledge and understanding, and they would be happy in their maturity. But some preferred to stay back in the wallow and mess of the old world, live immorally and corruptly and try to bring the selfish practices of the Devil’s organization into Jehovah’s organization. They preferred to disobey the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And what does it bring to them? Tribulation and distress. They are not pleased with their fellow man or any of Jehovah’s witnesses; they are angry. So when one disobeys the truth, he works injury to himself. It is so wise, then, for a man who has come to know Jehovah to stay close to him and his organization. It was Jesus who said, “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.” (John 15:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> This is a very interesting statement. It says that we can glorify the Father in heaven if we bear much fruit. In other words, if we preach the Word, find the other sheep, teach them and bring them to maturity, we are bearing fruit. We are glorifying the Father. But we do more than this; we prove ourselves to be disciples. That is why Jesus said, “Prove yourselves my disciples.” We want to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reading these pages of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> we have been reading about the happiness of Jehovah’s witnesses, how that happiness has been gained through preaching, how they have been giving to others of what they have learned. Look at their record. Look at the great increase in the number of publishers in the field service every month. Look at the many more who are associated with us that we can help to gain maturity. If they do gain this maturity, they will also be regular publishers like the thousands who already are mature in the truth. It will be a grand day when all of those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God are standing side by side, worshiping Jehovah in holy array.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If, during the coming year, all Jehovah’s witnesses strive to increase the average number of publishers in the field service every month by 10 per cent, it will mean a tremendous increase in witnesses serving God regularly; and if, in addition to that, we try diligently to increase our number of publishers at some time during the year by 20 per cent over our average for last year, then we shall have a tremendously big peak for which to reach. But it will be worth striving for, because while we are working for this higher number of regular publishers in the field and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a new</span><span class="font6"> peak at some time during the year, we shall be able to take care of them and bring these new ones to maturity. So let us strive for two things during the coming year—maturity on the part of all publishers already associated with us, which means making them regular publishers in the Kingdom work, and gathering many more of the other sheep, whether they be regular or irregular publishers, and bringing them gradually to this mature state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, in 127 lands and islands of the sea, we have publishers putting in millions of hours, making millions of back-calls, distributing millions of books, booklets and magazines, all of this to the honor and praise of Jehovah God. We have had a grand time during the past twelve months in giving of what we had to others, and we agree with Paul, “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Knowing this, and having much more to give to the peoples of the world and especially to the other sheep, we will continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom, worshiping Jehovah in holy array.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the branch servants, on behalf of the publishers in their countries, have asked that the love and greetings of the brothers be sent to their fellow workers in other parts of the earth. It is a pleasure to do this through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font6">Nowhere else in the world will you find such joy, unity, love, patience, peace of mind, and real happiness in a group of people as you will find among Jehovah’s faithful servants. I am very happy that I have had the opportunity this year to work so closely with our brothers in many parts of the earth, and I am thankful to Jehovah for the opportunity of being able again to submit a report on behalf of the Society. I am sure this report will bring satisfaction, contentment and gladness of heart to every reader interested in true worship and that all will be happy about the progress which has been made by Jehovah’s witnesses. Each one will continue loving his God in heaven and his brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So let us one and all press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again. (Heb. 6:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Let us hold our positions of service in this great organization that the “happy God” has formed in the earth to preach the Kingdom message. Be a faithful servant!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark287"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark288"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society provides for an annual meeting each year on October 1. This meeting was held in Pittsburgh at the Society’s registered office on that date in 1952 at the Wabash building, 410 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh 22, Pennsylvania. A large crowd of Jehovah’s witnesses was in attendance, packing out the auditorium, and nearly all the members of the Society were present in person or by proxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The business to be taken care of was the election of two directors whose terms had expired, and so the Society now has seven directors, namely, N. H. Knorr, F. W. Franz, G. Suiter, H. H. Reimer, T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle and M. G. Henschel. Other matters of interest were presented at this annual meeting, a report of the work generally throughout the world was given, very briefly, and a discussion was made by the president of the Society on the year’s text for 1953, namely, “Worship Jehovah in holy array.”—Ps. 29:2, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few weeks later, the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, met and unanimously elected Nathan H. Knorr as president, Fred W. Franz as vice-president, Grant Suiter as secretary and treasurer and Hugo H. Reimer as assistant secretary and treasurer. All the members of the board of directors are grateful to Jehovah for the privilege of being members of the Bethel family and of continuing on in their service, and they are grateful for the privilege of serving their brothers throughout the world in their various offices. They, with Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth, want to continue to worship Jehovah in holy array.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark289"></a><span class="font0">Yeartext for 1953</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Worship Jehovah in holy array.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">—Psalm 29:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A slave delights to do the will of his master. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to be anywhere in God’s great organization and there take care of the task that is given them to do. No matter where one finds himself, whether it be in the position of company servant or company publisher, pioneer or missionary, circuit servant or district servant, anywhere he is in this great organization which Jehovah God has built up, he serves as a slave of the Most High. No greater honor could come to any individual than to be among those who are carrying on true worship and praise of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When we pause for a moment and reflect on the accomplishments of God’s servants on the earth we are amazed at what can be done by imperfect creatures. We realize, though, that what is accomplished is not done by the strength of man, but only by the power of God, holy spirit, supporting him and guiding him. It is because Jehovah’s spirit shields, protects and guides his servant class on the earth that such a great witness has been given during the year 1952. And all these servants look ahead to 1953 with real joy and gladness of heart, happy to be able to give more of the truth they have received to others, for they know that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In this great army of men and women who are marching throughout the world, preaching that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand and declaring the sovereignty of the Most High, Jehovah, we find contented people. How can they be contented when they are behind the Iron Curtain? How can they be contented when they live in dicta-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">292 </span><span class="font6">torial countries and are not allowed to preach the good news? How can they be contented when the clergy of false religion cause mobs to attack them and to disturb them in their preaching? These things do not bring physical contentment, but they do bring a spiritual contentment. The Lord Jesus told us that all these things would occur to those who take up this grand work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth for a witness. Jehovah’s witnesses know that they will be persecuted because of Christ and that great opposition will be brought to bear against them because they are serving the Most High God, Jehovah. But they have a peace of mind wherever they are in the world, whether it be behind the Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, or anywhere else in the world. These people have the truth. They are marching together as God’s servants in holy array and are holding to their position, worshiping the Most High, not turning to the right or to the left, not causing dissension or trouble within God’s organization, but determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to keep it clean. When we get the over-all picture of Jehovah’s earthly organization, we individually, every one of us, take our position and stick to our work and say: “Worship Jehovah in holy array.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 8:13, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Godly fear of Jehovah, the great sovereign Superior, is right, desirable and proper. His superiority is so high as to make him supreme over all. It is so absolute that man the inferior is completely at his mercy. Jehovah of hosts is iu a class all by himself. For this reason true Christians properly sanctify him as completely set apart in their relationships with persons. No man can afford to trifle with Jehovah. Nor can man be careless as to God’s requirements, or treat his law lightly, for his powers to apply sanctions of punishment are infinite and lead to utter extinction in death. There must at all times be that dread of displeasing his sovereign majesty. The wise inferior is at all times mindful of his relationship to his great Superior. He ever seeks to ascertain God’s will and then diligently sets out to conform himself to this wise course.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, . . . because he considered me trustworthy by assigning me to a ministry, although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor. —1 Tim. 1:12, 13, NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark292"></a><span class="font3">Jehovah has shown undeserved kindness to the least of humanity, meu and women just like us. Paul was a recipient of this undeserved kindness. He appreciated it so much, he just had to express it iu the above words as well as in works. The gratitude to Jehovah that was Paul’s he wanted all other persons to feel too. Acknowledging his insolent disposition in times past, Paul tells Timothy of the undeserved kindness God showed toward him even though he was a blasphemer. He appreciated this love. His abounding joy was over the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ had considered him trustworthy and had delegated him to be a minister. What an assignment I What a privilege! Paul certainly appreciated his ministry. The account of his life shows that. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font3"> 1,2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A problem of great concern to all devoted parents is that of properly rearing children in divine favor. In proportion as the state encroaches upon the field of parental rights the problem becomes more difficult. By assuming increased control the present decadent old world society is seeking to reduce to its inferior unchristian level the high standards of Biblical training offered by God-fearing parents. Those who have a vision of the incoming New World society take a serious view of this matter. They note that true worshipers of Jehovah in previous ages were confronted with the same problem and solved it by applying the well-tried, sound principles of training and education rooted in the Scriptures. That these early God-fearing parents were successful is attested to by the Bible record of many faithful servants of God who from early youth were trained in godly devotion.—Heb. 11: 840, -VW.

<p><span class="font3">The visible headquarters of God’s typical theocratic organization of Israel was spoken of as being in or on “the sides of the north”. (Ps. 48:2; Isa. 14:13) So not from east or west or south but from Jehovah through his channel was proper promotion to come. In time it was replaced by a new system, and for a new, visible theocratic organization Christ “gave gifts in men”, which men were promoted to their positions by Jehovah. All were united in just the one hope, one faith, one baptism. (Eph. 4: 4-13, A'W) As foretold, after the death of the apostles and their co-workers wolfish ones scattered and split the flock into divisive sects and disrupted the visible organization. (Acts 20:29, 30; 2 Pet. 2:1) In our present time the visible theocratic organization has been restored by the setting up of the “faithful and discreet slave”.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore, become imitators of God, . . . and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved you.—Cph. 5:1, 2,</span><span class="font3"> AH'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was on earth he imitated his heavenly Father. He was interested in doing his Father’s will at all times. And so he was a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor to Him. His footstep followers must be people of the same kind. They should offer to God sacrifices of sweet-smelling savor, and they can do this by imitating God, by imitating Christ Jesus. (Phil. 4:18: 1 Pet. 2:5) Jesus showed love for his people. He laid down his life so that he might redeem them, and in showing his love for his people he wanted his followers to be different from this old world. The difference has to do with our love one toward another. This loving one another is so different from the way the world operates ; it means people coming together in a congregation, loving one another, getting along with one another. This love is possible if we imitate God, because God is love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It appears that God has chosen to state ahead of time many of his majestic purposes and their details in the form of prophecy as an evidence of his foreknowledge and his mastery of the situation produced by the rebellion in Eden. Further, he used prophecy in order to conceal sacred secrets which would serve as spiritual food for his servants to feed from at their unfolding in future generations. The study of Bible prophecies and their fulfillments is necessary to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the truth concerning God and his incoming new world of righteousness. It is necessary in order to build one’s faith in God and Christ JeSus, the King. The true religion’s being a revealed religion based on divine revelations, Christians, as practicers of true worship, will “make sure of all things” and “hold fast to what is right”, and this includes divine revelations in the form of prophecy.-—1 Thess. 5 : 20, 21, A'IK.

<p><span class="font3">From this we see that, while Jesus advocated the new and more important requirement for the youth to become a ministerial disciple of Christ, he did not set aside the hasic righteous principles found behind the law covenant of Jehovah with the nation of Israel. For example, Jesus mentioned in the above list the continued necessity of the obedient subjection of children to their parents. Years later Paul also employed this same principle of the Fifth Commandment. enjoining it upon the Gentile Christians of Ephesus. (Eph. 6:1-3) So while the sanctioned laws of Moses came to an end as laws for Israel when Jesus was impaled on the torture stake A.D. 33, yet the eternal principles underlying the law still stood as ap-p 1 i c a b 1 e.—Col. 2: 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW. </span><span class="font3">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font3"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Where one is able to act at will without any restraints or bounds whatsoever, such a one enjoys what might be described as total freedom. One wbo has total freedom obviously must be one that is completely independent of every other. There is only one who is in that totally independent position. That one is Jehovah God, the Sovereign Superior of the universe. All others, be they spirit creatures in heaven or humans on earth, are works of his hands and thus are dependent inferiors. For this reason Jehovah God is the sole one who is free in the absolute or complete sense. He uniquely enjoys what is known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">absolute freedom.</span><span class="font3"> None can question, limit or direct this Fountainhead of freedom who singly lives and dwells in the unlimited climate of free action at all times. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is an old custom for the worshipers of particular idols to have their idol’s mark upon a part of their body plainly to be seen. In Bible times it was also customary to set marks on servants and slaves, to distinguish them from others. Now, you may not mark yourself with such a literal mark on your person, but, just the same, you cannot escape being marked in the Bible sense to a certain destiny. To God, the Judge of your destiny, this mark is just as plainly visible as was the mark he set or prescribed for Cain. Because it is popular and finds favor with the mighty ones in power in this world, one may be proud of the mark he wears. It may win him the approval of this world, but it may doom him to destruction in the eyes of the Supreme One who determines the fate of the nations and governments of this world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The salvation of creatures is only a secondary purpose for the release of Babylon’s prisoners, Jehovah’s view of matters is what counts, and it shows the primary reason for their release. On different occasions in the wilderness Jehovah was going to destroy Israel, but Moses pleaded with Jehovah and prevailed upon him to spare them. On uhat grounds? The salvation of creatures? No, but for the sake of Jehovah’s great name. (Ex. 32:9-14; Num. 14:1124) We must make God’s thoughts our thoughts, if we are to see in clear focus and true perspective Jehovah’s destructive acts at the end of judgment periods. If wc persist in tenaciously clinging to the self-centered human view that focuses on creature salvation and leaves Jehovah’s vindication in the hazy, out-offocus background, this Scriptural teaching may offend and stumble us.—Isa. 55: 8, 9 ; John 6:60,66.

Yes; yes, there is! In this year of 1953 you will find it in a group of Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses. These, like the early congregations of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, are firm believers in God’s Word. They study it, they preach it, and they live it. They are “putting up with one another in love”, even though their customs and the tongues they speak are different. They ABE fulfilling the command to preach the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. (Matt. 24:14, 2V1V) Thus in all parts of the earth they demonstrate the unity of God’s visible organization.

If a parent chooses to sin against the holy spirit despite the eternal interests of his offspring, that then becomes the responsibility of the parent. The Scriptures show that the destructions at the time of the Flood and at the time of the fiery downpour on Sodom and Gomorrah were final. No small children were preserved in the ark; they must have been slain by Jehovah. Many babes and youngsters must have been in Sodom and Gomorrah, but their youthful innocence did not cause Jehovah to count them righteous. The presence of ten righteous ones would have saved those cities. There were certainly more than ten unresponsible children in them. Along with their unrighteous parents they were slain by Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Having ‘the heavens opened up’ to him enabled Jesus to recall his prehuman associations with the Father in heaven. This made it possible for him to recall all the many personal conversations he had with heavenly authorities in the ages past of his ancient existence. Jesus’ spirit-begetting and receiving the gift of the spirit now made it possible for him to repeat verbatim the pronouncements God discussed with him and in turn transmit them to man on earth. So here we have plenary communication in its highest form, with Jesus serving as the greatest prophet ever appointed by God. Hear Jesus' own words in support of this: “The things I speak, just as the Father has told me them, so I speak them.” (John 12:50, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> This makes Jesus Christ the greatest authority in the universe aside from Jehovah God himself. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 14</span></p>

Sovereignty is the source of any power to establish and define government- It is the sovereign power that determines the kind of government that shall rule over a group of creatures. Therefore the government of any group of creatures is the outward visible expression of the sovereign power behind it. Jehovah by virtue of his being the Creator is in such a pre-eminent, almighty position that he can legally and in fact determine the kind of government which shall rule his obedient creatures.

Now we do see that evil men slip in, ungodly men, and these we must try to find and throw out of the congregation. We do not want these types of persons in the congregation of God, and if they are there then they must be removed by the congregation.

<p><span class="font3">Instead of seizing the opportunity after the flood to make himself king of a supergovernment, Noah proceeded to set a pattern of developing small units of patriarchal societies, which family groups would live independently of each other and migrate into all parts of the earth. The unit of this arrangement was not the individual but the family, a group of related individuals ruled by its family head, the patriarch. After the death of a family head, the oldest son would continue the headship of that unit and permit the other sons to move off to start separate societies. Later in time, the sons of a family head held together after their father’s death under the leadership of an outstanding brother, as did the twelve sons of Jacob and thus became a “house” or clan of twelve families. In time each family of Israelites developed into a tribe, and finally these kindred tribes grew into a nation under the headship of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3">Modern theocratic training of the young presents many problems, but none of them are insurmountable. Today, as long ago foretold, political regimes have arisen, which deprive children of instruction by parents who fear Jehovah God. (Rev. 13:16, 17) But the careful theocratic parents will resist the encroachment of the state in this field of family rights. They will obey the superior authority of God by continuing to teach their offspring that obeying God’s laws and learning of God are matters of highest importance. (Mark 12:17) Furthermore, modern theocratic parents have to combat a rising tide of old world propaganda calculated to capture and twist the minds of the young. The prudent parent must minimize these sources of demon-inspired utterances and shield the minds of their young from their evil influence.—1 John 4:1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW. </span><span class="font3">IF </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font3"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is the responsibility of the servants of God to look after the interests of the congregation. If they are thoroughly convinced in their minds that an individual is wrong and should be put out of the company and the person has not made any steps toward repentance, then they tell the company, in the form of a resolution, of what they have done. They do not ask the company to vote on that resolution. No, the servants in the company are charged with the responsibility of shepherding the flock and of keeping the congregation clean. So the servants tell the company what action has been taken and that the offensive individual is no longer a member of this congregation. Then the congregation should co-operate to the fullest extent with the advice given by those who are looking after their interests, the servants in the organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 8, 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The prophets used to transmit prophecy were moved by an unerring means and in a wonderful manner. It was by inspiration that this was brought about. The Greek word above translated “inspired of God” is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thedpneustos, </span><span class="font3">which compound word literally means “God-breathed” or “breathed by God”. After his resurrection and shortly before his ascension into heaven, and thus before his disciples received the holy spirit at Pentecost, Jesus illustrated this means of inspiration by saying to his apostles, “ ‘May you have peace. Just as the Father has sent me forth, I also am sending you.’ And after he said this he </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">blew</span><span class="font3"> upon them and said to them: ‘Receive holy spirit.’” (John 20:21, 22, AIF) So as Jesus had illustrated, a few days later the actual event occurred when 120 of his disciples were inspired with holy spirit. The holy spirit was the specific means employed not only at Pentecost but also in all cases of inspiration. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 10,11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Immediately after the overt act in defiance of Jehovah’s sovereign will had been committed, Jehovah, the Supreme Judge, held court. The God Sovereign disempowered this first governmental ruler over man and justly sentenced to eventual annihilation this unfaithful cherub who in the guise of a serpent had carried out a hitherto uuheard-of treason against the Universal Sovereign Power. By his dastardly act he had raised au issue as to God’s supremacy which Jehovah at once accepted and was bound to vindicate. Jehovah even uttered his first recorded prophecy where, in veiled language, he foretells the empowering of a new ruler, a seed-king and vindicator. God’s determination to settle this great issue in his way was indicated years later in the contest that developed between Jehovah and Pharaoh of Egypt. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah knows those who belong to him.—2 Tim. 2:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This also means little children at Armageddon whose parents belong to Jehovah and w’ho try to rear them according to God's Word. This fact should make those of Jehovah’s witnesses who are parents soberly refleet on the theocratic training they now give their children. Parents are commanded to instruct their children </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">God's ways, and if in these last days parents fail to heed the divine instructions they may bring destruction not only upon themselves but also upon their small children at Armageddon. And if these small children become grown and responsible on their own before Armageddon strikes, the parental training may determine whether they choose the course of life or death. There comes a time when maturing children reach the age of accountability and shoulder the responsibility of choosing for themselves the course they will follow. They then come out from under family responsibility or merit. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 9,10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For such freedom Christ set us free.—Cal. 5:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even now it is possible to return to a measure of relative freedom. This is done by following the advice and course set by Christ Jesus. “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” What truth and understanding sets us free? It is the acquiring of an accurate knowledge of the inferior’s right standing before the Sovereign Superior, Jehovah, and acting upon that knowledge that brings true freedom. By diligently heeding the words of Jesus and searching out the many revelations of truth stored away in the Bible, Christians have come to determine some of the boundaries of their newly found relative freedom. Having due regard for these bounds they have entered into a safe freedom which brings them much present happiness, a sense of genuine security as to the future and a peace of mind that passes all understanding.

<p><span class="font3">Many persons will argue that we have met Jehovah’s requirements if we love our neighbor as ourselves, which means unselfishly doing good to our neighbors. But that this is not true is shown by the above words. What so many persons fail to note here is that love for Jehovah with nothing divided or held back is made, foremost and neighbor love comes last. How can love for Jehovah be shown? “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments” Doing this first, and loving neighbor secondly, we meet God’s requirements; for Jesus said of such obedient ones: “Keep on doing this and you will get life.” (Luke 10: 28: 1 John 5 : 3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Actually, a person who claims that God’s requirements are met by one’s doing good according to one’s own conscience is merely applying a salve to his conscience, to soothe it as he goes in his own selfish way.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 3:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘The line of the prophets’ begins with Samuel and runs all the way down to John the Baptist. These were special spokesmen of Jehovah who were sent to give counsel to the kings and to the nation. When, after Solomon’s time, there were the two nations, Israel and Judab, God provided a line of prophets to serve each country. All these prophets were valiant witnesses for Jehovah. They held themselves available for consultation on private and public matters. They issued publie rebukes to violators of the law covenant. They predicted future events. Some of them performed miracles by the power of God. They uncompromisingly took their stand on God’s side of whatever issue was current in their time. They were ready to withstand the stream of public opinion and persecution rather than compromise. These proved prophets speak to us today in thunderous tones as the complete fulfillments of their prophecies unfold.

<p><span class="font3">From the days of Jesus until now, a period of over 1900 years, the pages of history have run red with the blood of faithful servants of God, who, like Jesus, took their stand on Jehovah’s side of the issue of supremacy and published Jehovah’s provision for salvation through Christ. They were brutally persecuted and murdered in the Roman arena, through the catacombs, under the crusaders, by the demonic Inquisition, in the horrible concentration camps of Hitler-ized Germany and at the present time in Russian salt mines. The Devil instigated this persecution by inflaming the passions of his dupes through propaganda and demon influence. In all this, faithful men of all ages have proved the Devil a liar and demonstrated that Jehovah can place men on earth who will be faithful to him.

<p><span class="font3">The slave and the domestics are the same persons, only from different viewpoints. Under the term “slave” Christ’s anointed followers of today are viewed as a class, a composite slave or composite servant. God himself so interprets matters: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” (Isa. 43: 10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font3"> Note that many witnesses are called one servant. Under the term &quot;domestics” those making up the slave class are viewed as individuals. They are spoken of as “body of attendants” at Luke 12: 42, .VII'. They are domestic slaves in the household of God and, as a united class or society, are termed “the faithful and discreet slave”. Similarly, wheu a number of domestics turn wicked and start to beat their fellow slaves these evildoers become the foretold “evil slave” class. —Matt. 24:48-51, .VW.

<p><span class="font3">It was over nineteen hundred years ago that the recipients of God’s undeserved kindness were taken into a new covenant with God. These were to be “a people for his name”. Like Christ Jesus and Paul, these were proclaimers of the kingdom of God. A new system of things, a new organization, was starting, and it was of vital importance. The forming of this visible organization, wherein each individual must be faithful until death, was a very serious matter; and so the members appreciated to the full that they must work together in unity, because God had brought them together for a special purpose. Eventually the eyes of the world have come to be upon them. Here are the announcers of Jehovah’s kingdom, the only hope of the world.

To all nations, throughout the inhabited earth, the witness given will be sufficient to meet Jehovah’s purpose, and it will be completed before Armageddon comes. This witness will provide the basis for the judgment wherein the people of all nations are separated into sheep and goat classes. Will Christ the Judge do a halfway job? Will he fail to complete the work outlined for him, and have an unforetold third class left over that he failed to separate? Or will he complete the dividing work Jehovah committed to him, and separate the people of the nations into just the two classes, and thereby accomplish the divine purpose and fulfill the divine word?

<p><span class="font3">An organization is an arrangement of creatures brought together to perform certain work and to enjoy common blessings resulting from such association.

As the spiritual remnant today partake of the one Memorial loaf, they discern that they are one body under Jesus Christ the Head and are dying the one death with him in vindication of Jehovah. So they keep filled with the unifying spirit of God and together they hold fast to their Head Jesus Christ and so worship, study and serve God in unbreakable unity and peace and mutual love. They recognize the other sheep whom their Lord Jesus Christ has now made one. flock with them, and they lovingly serve the interests of his earthly sheep. The other sheep respond to such loving-kindness.

That is exactly what has been happening during the past many years to the world-wide community of Jehovah’s witnesses who have been undergoing a matchless course of divine training. Their teachers have been Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus. From their uniform textbook, the Bible, they have learned the pure language of Bible truth.

That is, we can forgive the other person’s trespasses against us. We cannot wipe them out and make him clean again, but when a person asks for forgiveness we can give it to him. In Galatians 6:1 (A'W) it says: “Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to restore such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted.” So we have a responsibility upon us to go to these individual sinners, or, when they come to ns, to help them stay in the right way even before disfellowshiping ever takes place. We can forgive them. We can help them, if their heart is right and they show it. But if they do not show it and if the sin vitally affects the congregation, we cannot overlook it, for the sake of that individual and for the sake of the congregation.

<p><span class="font3">What shall we call the step which Jesus took in coming to do God’s will in the body which God had prepared for him to use on earth? Well, by birth as a Jew Jesus already belonged to a nation holy to God. Also as a forty-day-old babe Jesus was presented to Jehovah at his temple because he was Mary’s first-born son. Regarding his very birth the angel Gabriel said to Mary: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy. God’s Son.” (Luke 1:35, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Jesus was holy and devoted to God by virtue of all these things So what could we call his stepping out to do God’s will?

<p><span class="font3">How do you choose life in the new world? You choose that life in the same way you choose the present one, by the course of. action that you take, and which course is not dictated or determined by you but by the body. The body sets its terms, forces you to meet its requirements. So it is in choosing life in the new world. It is not by merely saying you would like to live then, but the choice is made by the course of action you take. And here again the action is not determined by the individual. Jehovah God is the one who establishes that new world and gives persons life in it. He gives it on his own terms, and we must meet his requirements.

<p><span class="font3">Babylon’s plagues are destruction, fiery and final. (Rev. 18: 4, 8) Her organization will never be resurrected or raised up from her destructive baptism of fire. If this is her plague, and if those who remain in her share it, how can we contend that those individuals undergoing fire baptism with her will rise in the resurrection of mankind? We cannot do so Scripturally. The plain statement is that the fate of individuals remaining within the organization is the same as that of the organization itself. If the individuals return, the organization will; but if the organization does not, neither will the individuals once within it. The way to salvation is flight now, before its fall. Israelite captives in ancient Babylon were instructed to flee that wicked system.

<p><span class="font3">Having gained freedom from the bondage that grips mankind, a stout fight ensues to retain that relative freedom which the truth brings us. This means pursuing a new and clean course away from the deadly system of bondage found in the old world society. We must resist the sinful ways of the flesh and take up the new way of freedom, which means to embrace righteousness and become obedient to God’s will. “Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you arc slaves of him because you obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view?” (Rom. 6: 16, .VW) We have served long enough as bond servants to the Gentile nations in performing deeds of loose conduct.

<p><span class="font3">To gain salvation we must find out what God’s will is for us as expressed in his Word and then do it. This is going to take courage, faith and a strong conviction based upon a knowledge of God and his purposes. Therefore the study of the Bible and the helps which God is now providing, and which helps alone point to God’s kingdom as the only hope of salvation, is very necessary. Just as the servants of God in past times had to draw courage from their convictions and demonstrate it even to death in many cases, so with us today. We must therefore prove for ourselves that God is right, and stick to it. What if it does cost our present life? The issue is: Do we want to die on God’s side assured of a resurrection and endless life in perfection in Jehovah’s kingdom or die condemned and executed of God as a rebel on the Devil’s side without any hope of life in the future?

<p><span class="font3">While at Eden time Satan was disempowered and legally divorced from God’s organization, this did not mean that he was banished from being present upon the earth where he could influence the development of civilization toward his own selfish ends or from his associating with angels in heaven. From the conversation between Jehovah and the expelled sham sovereign, Satan, as recorded at Job 1: 6-12, we can see that he had earthly interests with fallen mankind requiring his supervision as an invisible self-constituted overlord. Having made himself independent by what he thought was a successful break from God’s government, from then forward Satan as a mimie sovereign sought to empower many different kinds of governments of his own design over fallen mankind. From his first attempt in establishing a kingdom at Babylon in Nimrod’s time to the present all the many nontheocratic governments have been of his invention and authorization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3">12,13</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The distances between the superior and the inferior determine the degrees of superiority and of inferiority. By his very position the superior is an independent one and therefore has no rule or law to follow except such as he should bind upon himself. In an organization where Jehovah God is the superior, the distance between the superior and the inferior is extremely great, absolute, in fact. This means that Jehovah God is in position to dictate laws and make rules of conduct governing practically every minute detail of the actions of his servants. This is so because as inferiors his servants are totally dependent upon him for life and all its associated blessings. While it is safe and desirable to dwell under a paternalistic government where Jehovah is the absolute superior to be feared, yet in the field of Caesar’s governments this is dangerous and leads to great oppression. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 9,10</span></p>

So they will remain on earth, to which paradise will be restored. In view<sup>7</sup> of this God will even carry an unnumbered “great crowd” of them safely through Armageddon, in order that humanity may continue on earth with an unbroken existence from the start and forever.

<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s witnesses have shepherding responsibilities in their respective territories, where there are many lost and sickly prospective other sheep that have to be lovingly tended. If this condition is due to negligence in caring for any of these sheep put in our custody by the great Owner, Jehovah God, we shall be held responsible for the lives of such ones. (Ezek. 3: 17-19) But if we try to help these wayward ones now with God’s, message of life and if in spite of our efforts Satan the roaring lion devours them, then we are free from responsibility for such destroyed prospective sheep. Like Jesus and the apostles the faithful undershepherds today earnestly discharging their ministry will have the satisfaction of seeing the preservation of a vast multitude of Jesus’ other sheep whom they have been privileged to find, aid and protect unto everlasting life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/13 </span><span class="font3">14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By this prayer Christians agree to limit their own free wills in harmony with the will of God. This means that whatever revelations of divine will are made clear to them, they are to govern their actions accordingly. Diligently they seek greater knowledge and appreciation of His will from bis Word and earnestly set about to adjust their actions in conformity to that right will of God. For example, it is now God’s will that His witnesses declare the name of Jehovah throughout all the inhabited earth. It is also His will for his established kingdom to proceed to break in pieces all the kingdoms of this old world in the battle of Armageddon just ahead. Who are we to resist his will? Rather, we hasten to adapt our lives and affairs in full harmony with His will that it may ever be performed on earth as in the heavens.

<p><span class="font3">Neither Paul nor any other of the human family deserved such kindness from God. But still Paul was shown such love and was given the opportunity to declare good news concerning God’s love to the nations and to make known the majesty, the power and the wonderfulncss of the Creator and his Son. He came away from the bondage of that old system of things in which he had lived, and now for the first time he had freeness of speech through knowledge of Jehovah. What Paul learned about God’s revealed purposes through Christ Jesus gave him confidence to do his work, through his faith. This faith was never shaken. His trials, tribulations and buffetings were many; still he was faithful until death. He was a man of integrity. Paul is an inspiration and a good example for us to follow, because he himself followed in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.

They will not bring upon themselves condemnation as does the world which tries to stop children from following after Christ. We need only to mention the shameful practice in many countries where Caesar’s educational authorities expel well-behaved children of Jehovah's witnesses because they cannot conscientiously salute national flags. (Ex. 20: 4,5) In spite of misunderstandings and opposition Jehovah’s faithful people and their children will continue to obey God’s law first. (Acts 5:29) As part of their true worship to Jehovah God Jehovah’s witnesses will render this duty toward God by paying back what belongs to him and resist the Caesars who have no authority to interfere with Christian rights of parental education in Biblical ways and commands.—Luke 20 : 25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3">In unquestionable terms the Bible testifies that Jehovah God has been against interfaith from beginning to end.

He did not sanction interfaith by looking with favor upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">both </span><span class="font3">Cain’s and Abel’s worship. Abel’s animal sacrifice showed recognition of his need of a sin-atoning sacrifice; it prefigured Christ’s death as a ransom. Cain’s bloodless offering was empty formalism. Even after correction from God the hurt religious pride of Cain would not let him copy Abel’s acceptable way of worship by offering a suitable animal, which was close at hand for use. He murdered Abel instead. (Gen. 4:3-3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yg;</span><span class="font3"> Heb. 9: 22) Who showed intolerance? Abel? Jehovah?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 89:19, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It appears that when a prophet received a vision, the impression of the revelation, utterance or picture of God’s purpose was made upon his conscious mind. During such period of consciousness when the prophet was wide awake the active force of God would ‘bear along’ or superimpose the divine impressions so vividly upon the mind of the prophet that he could clearly remember every detail. It seems the vision was then left for the prophet to describe in his own words under supervision of the unerring spirit of God. To the extent that the prophet was left to his own words of description and expression, he was not a mere automaton or robot, but had the divine guidance in order to express truthfully the things shown to him so vividly. The very faet that all the prophets wrote their prophecies and revelations in their own varying styles bears this out. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">New world living is so much better that it defies comparison with this present life.

We should appreciate that it is not the sincere following of a form of worship as some orthodox religious organization sees it, but that it is the sincere doing of God’s will set forth in his Word, the Bible, that will set us in the course of new world living. In this day of judgment, when Christ the King divides the people of all nations as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, we should appreciate that all persons are fixing their eternal destiny. Whether on the basis of what they are doing or are not doing, they are choosing either life or death. (Matt. 25 : 31-46) Now is the time for choosing. Is your choice for life or for death?

<p><span class="font3">It was to help the early Christian congregation at Corinth to discern the Lord Jesus Christ’s body and to promote peace and unity among them that Paul drew lessons from the meaning of the Memorial emblems. Today, as a result of this discernment of the Lord’s body at Memorial time all the sheep, the remnant and the great crowd of other sheep, are vigorous, healthy and energetically alive to God’s service as witnesses to the universal sovereignty and name of Jehovah. Because of the correct discernment of the body they arc at peace and harmony with one another even though dwelling in worldly nations that are at war with one another for the domination of the earth. If the hundreds of millions of “church members” and clergymen of Christendom discerned the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and conducted themselves accordingly as Jehovah’s witnesses have done during the past two world wars, there would have been no such global conflicts nor the threat of a third one plaguing them now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In harmony with the illustration of the sheep and goats, the above scripture shows but two classes, those marked for preservation and the unmarked ones appointed to destruction, none being spared on account of age, or sex. Note that in tbis picture the ones preserved are those who did “sigh and cry for all the abominations” done in the land in reproach of Jehovah’s true worship. In the parable of the sheep and goats the ones preserved showed favor toward Christ’s brothers. In both cases the ones destroyed were those who remained indifferent or neutral as well as opposers. Christ Jesus, during the judgment fieriod when he was on earth, aid down the principle for such times: “He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.” No room remains for a third class. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A dedicated Christian is not called to live to himself but is invited to enter with his fellow Christians into the united service of the Lord God.

In fact, the entire Christian Greek Scriptures are full of rich counsel as to a Christian’s conduct toward his fellows. A Christian cannot be self-willed, have his own way in the congregation, or show no consideration for the feelings of his associates. Definitely as to fellowship, w’e have a series of wise restrictions to our safe relative freedom.

All this was reducing the sham sovereign to a helpless inferior and demonstrated that his control on earth was not allembracing. In fact, he merely controlled those parts where he had blinded the inhabitants with his false religious and had kept them in line by means of his various makeshift governments. Never has he enjoyed undisputed control and power over all mankind, because at all times there have been those who have clung to the true worship of Jehovah God and who have looked forward to a restoration of a divine, sovereign-empowered government over all the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

Before their judgment period was over, those Jews were literally confronted by Gentiles like the Ninevites who repented and became part of the bride of Christ. The Jews judged themselves unworthy of life. Abel did not have to be alive for his blood to cry out from the ground in condemnation of Cain, and his course of integrity and the record of it speaks, even though Abel is dead. Similarly, the course of the Ninevites, and the record of it, could rise and speak in condemnation of the Jews during their judgment period back there. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 19</span></p>

In the group spoken of as general prophets we find such men as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Aaron, Moses and Jesus. All these were mighty spokesmen of Jehovah in their day, used to utter sacred pronouncements of world-shattering importance.

They are not working in the defense of Jehovah’s name and his Word. They are not working in the interest of building up this body in love. They are working against the organization.

When Cornelius and his fellow hearers accepted Peter’s message and silently exercised faith in their hearts, thus dedicating themselves to this new belief, God observed and poured out his holy spirit upon them, conveying to them the gift to speak prophecies.

Therefore Jehovah said: “I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.” (Judg. 2:3) Because of their unwise tolerance of false worship the Israelites were pierced with thorny demonism and snared by false gods.

<p><span class="font3">If, to gain remission of our daily sins, Christ’s sacrifice has to be renewed and repeated often, then it would mean that the “new covenant” would also have to be renewed by a sacrifice afresh of the Savior. If one sacrifice did not hold good for sins, it did not hold good for the new covenant according to which God forgives sins and remembers them no more. (Luke 22:20) But such a renewal of the new covenant is unscriptural. The inaugurating of the old Mosaic law covenant foreshadowed the inaugurating of the new covenant by the glorified Jesus at Pentecost A.D. 33. The old law covenant was not inaugurated and renewed every year with fresh sacrifices. The one set of sacrifices which Moses offered at Sinai sufficed for the entire life of that law covenant.

They are doing the removed one a benefit, because he might be ashamed as a result and get back into line. They are doing the right thing in God’s sight by putting him out of the congregation because he is unclean. By this procedure God’s visible organization will remain clean through the coming battle of Armageddon, on into the new world. Anyone who wants to live in that new world will have to live according to the principles of Jehovah God, as set down in His Word, for we must become imitators of God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W .1/1</span><span class="font3"> 9b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Those who are disturbed by the view that the destruction at Armageddon is final should remember several points. First, if Jehovah destroyed everyone at Armageddon there would be no injustice involved, since none have any inherent right to life. Second, the witness work will be done to the extent God deems necessary for separating all peoples. Third, the division is not completed yet, the judgment period not over. It is not the unfinished division now existing that counts, but the finished one that obtains at Armageddon’s start. Though we are in a judgment period, we need not view as finally destroyed all who die from various causes prior to the execution of judgment at Armageddon. Some of Jehovah's people may even die during Armageddon because unable to endure the ordeal; but the vast majority will be “the slain of the Lord” who will remain dead forever.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 1: 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before his ascension into heaven Jesus gave his Christian followers the right by commission to preach concerning Christ Jesus in every part of the earth. This places a duty upon all earthly rulers and the peoples in general to permit these ministers to accomplish their commission. To have this Christian right to preach Christ recognized by the Roman government, Paul appealed his case up to the supreme court of the empire located in Rome. Referring to this legally establishing of the right to preach the good news Paul says, all of you being sharers with me in the undeserved kindness both in my prison bonds and in the defending and legally establishing of the good news.” (Phil. 1: 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> For this reason Christian ministers today insist on their rights to preach the Kingdom message in all countries.

<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus in unmistakable terms showed that he wanted no interfaith movement with the clergy of his day. Instead of joining with them he told his followers: “Be on the alert and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Seeing that his disciples were confused and thinking of literal loaves with yeast in them, Jesus enlightened them as to the meaning of his pictorial language : “ ‘How is it you do not discern that I did not talk to you about loaves? But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the yeast of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Jesus also said: “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” This yeast of false religion is a great danger to the Christian. So the true faith stays aloof from contaminating interfaith moves. —Matt. 16: 6,11,12 ; Luke 12:1; 1 Cor. 5:6, .W. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

The fact should be reported that this man was at one time with us, but because of his course of action he has been disfellowshiped, and the reasons why should be given very briefly. Otherwise, it may be that we would be accused of libel or slander and we might get ourselves into difficulty. But our brothers may he warned of that individual.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision.—Acts 11:5,</span><span class="font3"> A'lP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trance is akin to visions and dreams. It appears that while in a state of deep concentration of mind or in a sleeplike condition the active force of God superimi&gt;oses a picture of his purpose or a vision upon the mind of the one so entranced. As in the cases of straight visions and dreams the inspired one is left to describe the vivid revelation in his own words or expressions. There is the example of Peter who while very hungry fell into a trance where he realistically saw &quot;some sort of vessel descending . . . , and in it there were all kinds of four-footed creatures and creeping things”. (Acts 10:1016; 11:5-10, SW) The slight variations Peter makes in the two accounts of this tranee indicate that he was left free to express himself in his own words. Another case of a revelation given by a trance is that of Paul while he was praying in the temple in Jerusalem. —Acts 22: 17-21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font3"> IF </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/15 </span><span class="font3">20</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Matt. 26:27,28, Dy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If Jesus had meant that the bread had been turned into his flesh, he would properly have said, ‘Do this in sacrifice of me.’ Instead, he said to do it “for a commemoration of me”. Note also that Jesus indicated that the liquid in the chalice was still literal wine, for he said: “I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine,” not, drink henceforth of this blood. Another fact which shows it was not his blood is that Jesus said : “This is my blood . . . , which shall be shed.” This plainly shows his blood was not there being shed by transub-stantiation, but indicated a future time, namely, when Jesus hung on the torture stake at Calvary. So by his words Jesus did not mean the bread and wine were his own flesh and blood. 17 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span><span class="font3"> 13,14</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 14: 4, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fully 150 years before Jerusalem lost its national sovereignty to the Gentile nation of Babylon, Isaiah prophesied the taunt song recorded in chapter 14 of his prophecy. It was against the king of Babylon, who was described as a ‘hewer down of fir-trees’, meaning a killer of God’s true worshipers. (Isa. 61:3) The king of Babylon, Isaiah foretold, would exalt his throne above the stars or princes of God’s typical theocracy and would overthrow this sovereign government by completely subjugating it. He having gained this ascendancy as a world ruler, God’s judgment would come and the king of Babylon too would be cut down like a tree and all men would see his humiliation. All this came to pass upon the ruling dynasty of Nebuchadnezzar, the conquering king of Babylon. He in turn symbolized the greater king of Babylon, Satan the Devil, who eventually will be totally defeated and cut down to annihilation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

Impress your dedication to God upon your own heart by publicly symbolizing it with water baptism in obedience to Jesus Christ, to help you never to forget it. Be certain that God, who cannot lie and who loves no lie, holds you irrepealably to your vow. Remember that those who are “false to agreements” “are deserving of death”.

<p><span class="font3">Christians today find themselves confronted with two superiors. This situation is not new.

In all three instances the one superior is an assumed, temporary, tolerated superiority, that of the limited superiority of man-made Caesar governments. The other superior is the genuine unlimited superiority of Jehovah God. Jehovah’s witnesses today are clearly able to determine their legal relationships and duties to the two sets of governing superiors, both of which bring obligations upon Christian inferiors. Their legal position is invincible. This is by reason of their being heirs of the many sound legal doctrines and principles recorded in the Scriptures and of the many legal precedents of Biblical cases which are currently applicable. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During his ministry Jesus introduced a freeness of thought and speech that had vanished from the earth by his time. He was no part of the world even though ne was in it. By his words and his actions he demonstrated a freeness of speech that cheered the hearts of men. His sayings were not based on any old false religious tradition. What he taught he did not learn in the schools of his day. He learned it by studying the Hebrew Scriptures, by communicating with God in prayer and by dedicating himself to doing his Father’s will. He was a man free to say the things that were true and righteous and an honor to Jehovah’s name. He was free to do things that would bring praise to his heavenly Father. He restored pure worship of the Most High God. He condemned hypocrites and false religions with their idol worship. All the persons in the congregation of God must have this same freedom of thought and expression.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.—Luke 2: 52, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a child Jesus himself received a proper sound Biblical education. His Judean mother Mary and his foster father Joseph of the house of David gave him the customary Jewish upbringing of the day. As a youth in his early teens Jesus continued to render honor and obedience to his earthly parents in complete godly subjection. In these formative years he grew wholesomely in wisdom and physical stature. At the same time he studied the Hebrew Scriptures and apprenticed as a carpenter. (Luke 2:47; Matt. 13:55) Of this early period of his human existence it is written: “And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he continued subject to them.” Nowhere in Jesus’ later life does he speak disapprovingly of the principles and customs used for his rearing in divine favor. Christian parents today will likewise train their children according to Biblical high standards. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font3"> 6,2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Did Jesus make himself God's High Priest to offer sacrifice as Aaron did and to rule as the ancient priest Mel-chizedek did? The scripture above answers No. That was not Jesus’ privilege, even though he was God’s holy Son. Before Jesus’ time men who tried to consecrate or appoint themselves to the priesthood of Israel received due punishment from God for their presumption. Call to mind the cases of Korah and of Kings Saul and Vzziah. Jesus was not of the tribe of Levi nor of the priestly family of Aaron. So he did not presume to install himself in the royal priesthood like that of Melchizedek and thus dictate to God what his will for Jesus should be to satisfy some personal ambitions.

The wicked world will take you into the grave; the truth will give you life. Keep the congregation of our brothers clean. We cannot come into this organization with reservations for the sake of moral badness. We are not free to do things we want for the gratification of the flesh.

<p><span class="font3">The principle of family responsibility also works in reverse, in what might be called family merit. Israelite firstborns were spared in the tenth plague because the family heads obeyed Jehovah’s command to spatter the Passover lamb's blood on the doorposts. Itahab’s wise course resulted in the preservation of her family. It was partly out of regard for Abraham that his nephew Lot was favored, and the angels that visited Sodom were, for Lot’s sake, going to allow him to take his relatives to safety with him. Their refusal and subsequent destruction shows that there must be co-operation with the family head if family merit is to be realized.

The Christians did not participate in these seditions, did not have political prejudices, and ambitions, biit were interested only in peace and calm in which they conld preach the gospel.

If we do not see a point at first we should keep trying to grasp it, rather than opposing and rejecting it and presumptuously taking the position that we are more likely to be right than the discreet slave. We should meekly go along with Jehovah’s theocratic organization and wait for further clarification.

So doing, he then confesses by eating the Memorial bread that he also partakes of the “body of the Lord”, that is to say, he is a member of it.

<p><span class="font3">The road thought right might nonetheless lead to death, and the mere thinking that it is right does not allow one to escape the consequences of a wrong course. “A fool is sure that his own way is right: sensible men will listen to advice.” (Prov. 12: 15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mo)</span><span class="font3"> The inexhaustible source of sound advice is God’s Word, and Jehovah’s true servants on earth heed it and declare it, and sensible ones hear it and conform to it, but fools conceitedly press on in their own stubborn way. “Man thinks out many a plan, but ’tis the Eternal’s purpose that prevails.” (Prov. 19:21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mo) </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s purpose is to give life to those who obey him. not to those who obey themselves; and it is his purpose in this matter of salvation that will prevail.

<p><span class="font3">This indicates that prophecies are sealed until the physical facts appear that begin to fulfill them. So the rule seems to be reasonable and certain that prophecies cannot be understood until they are iu course of fulfillment or until they have been fulfilled. Jehovah as the great Interpreter makes known the meaning of his revelations in his due time, and speculation by men cannot bring to light the true meaning of prophecy before time. Jehovah has provided a channel, the “faithful and discreet slave” class, who are given spiritual “food at the proper time”, and this spiritual food includes the understandings of the prophecies in the course of their fulfillments. As fast as the “superior authorities” Jehovah and Christ Jesus reveal the interpretations through their provided channel that fast do God’s people publish them the world over to strengthen the faith of all lovers of righteousness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are two organizations in the world today. One is God’s and the other belongs to the Devil, the ‘‘god of this system of things”. Jehovah God is very much interested in keeping his organization clean and separate from this evil, wicked world in which we are now living. He has a reason for this. His servants belong to him, they stand for his name, they stand for his Word, and they stand for clean worship. The whole purpose of bringing his servants, his people, into an organization is to keep them clean from the Devil’s organization. As long as we walk in the way of the Devil’s crowd we cannot remain clean. So God has built his own organization. This organization that Jehovah God is now building up for the vindication of his name and word is built up on love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 1, 3</span></p>

Thus in spite of Satan’s iron-like governments and their strong powers of persecution Jehovah’s people in all ages have stood apart and survived. Even today all those who form the nucleus of the New World society, both the anointed remnant and those of the other sheep, have in fact come out from Babylonish bondage and have escaped the dutches of Satan.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 13: 5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul here discusses the primary motive for a Christian’s being in subjection to theocratic superior authorities. He shows that the compelling motive is not only that of avoiding the wrath of punishment at the hands of God’s government but the more powerful force in us, that of our conscientious love for righteousness, our deep love for Jehovah our Great Benefactor. Conscience is that faculty of the mind by which the human creature realizes and distinctly perceives or appreciates that a course of action is right or wrong. The Christian’s conscience having long been trained from the Word of God knows fully what God’s will is and what is the right thing to do to please his heavenly Master. Thus out of our warm love for God which our consciences are constantly bathed with, the Christian unhesitatingly keeps himself in total subjection to Jehovah and his theocratic governing authorities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> Ila</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Just like the little Davids and Sarahs in the days of ancient Israel who attended the synagogue meetings, so too the modern little Davids and Sarahs should be eager to attend every meeting. They should learn to sit quietly and listen to all that goes on. The other members of the congregation can contribute their part by befriending and speaking to all the youths in their midst. This has a beneficial effect on the children and makes them feel that they are part of a large family of God. When the boys get old enough they should be encouraged to enroll in the theocratic ministry school. There is no better training today in the Christian ministry than that offered by the Society at its congregational meetings of Bible study and its course in the theocratic ministry school. Let every son and daughter of Jehovah’s witnesses delight to take full part in such congregational meetings.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The cup of blessing which we bless, ts it not a sharing in the cup of the Christ?—1 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">10:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a self-scrutinized Christian drinks out of the Memorial wine-cup he confesses that Jesus’ blood was the means to put God’s new covenant in force, and by means of which covenant the divine forgiveness of sins is gained and a people is taken out of all nations to be a people for God’s name. Another thing: the poured-out blood of Christ signifies death, not merely for a new covenant to be made over a dead victim, but primarily for vindicating Jehovah’s sovereignty, in which death Christ’s body-members share. They are planted with him in the likeness of his death that they may be raised to heavenly spirit life in the likeness of his resurrection. So to the wine-drinker the cup pictures the sufferings which the heavenly Father has poured like a potion for all the Christ company, the Head and the body. By drinking of the Memorial cup one confesses that he is determined to suffer with Jesus till death. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font3"> 35-37</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Paul is pointing out that persons of these types of sinners have come out of the world into God’s congregation, but all of these types of sin may </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> remain in the congregation of God after those who once committed such sins have once been washed clean. When a person comes to God’s organization and dedicates himself to Him, he </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> cleaned up. From then on he ought to make straight paths for his feet and follow the Word of God. He should not be practicing these things, and Jehovah forgives him for all those things that have been in his life in times past. Their stain is washed away, and he must not go back to them. If one does go back to them, then he is committing a sin that is worthy of dis-fellowshiping. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3/1</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Peter uses the _ transfiguration vision to bring home to the minds of his brothers that he had not been ‘artfully contriving false stories’, for he himself had been an eyewitness to the magnificence of that vision. It was very evident that what the apostles saw conveyed to their minds factual proof of his power and presence. Peter clearly shows that the vision was to him the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise that some of his disciples would not taste death until they had first seen the Son of man in his kingly power. By this vision they had witnessed the presence and power of Jesus Christ in Kingdom glory, and coupled with this were the words borne to Jesus, ‘This is my Son, my beloved, on whom I have set my approval.’ The apostles saw the brilliance, the magnificence, and actually heard Jehovah’s voice from heaven acknowledging Jesus as the beloved Son of God and commanding them to “listen to him”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1 7,</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark294"></a><span class="font3">It is a great privilege to share in the witness work, still more to have a part in the ministerial work of helping to train others. Take full advantage, therefore, of all the different meetings, the various publications of the Society, and the helping hand of the appointed servants to assist you in a practical way in actual field service. In that way, not only will you become firmly established as a regular and zealous publisher, but, like the organization itself, you will make continual progress toward the fullness of growth that belongs to maturity. That means not only putting in more hours, but putting more into those hours in the way of better quality of service. It means giving a more effective witness, according to the varying needs of each individual. This requires maturity of discernment, but it is more pleasing in Jehovah’s sight, is of greater aid to the listener, and helps the minister become steadfast and unmovable. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font3"> 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">16:7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus obeyed from the heart. But examples are provided in Scripture of those who did not obey from the heart, and one of the most outstanding is King Saul. His experience demonstrates clearly that there may be outward obedience that is not a true indication of the heart’s sincerity and compliance with God's will. Jehovah judges the real motive that inspires one to action. Saul did not carry out in completeness the command God had given him and excused himself that he had saved the king, Agag, probably to display him and then kill him, and then partly blamed the people. This was a paltry excuse, for it was self-evident Saul had not carried out the commands received, and to say the reason for not doing it was to offer sacrifice to Jehovah was not pleasing. Saul’s heart was not right and he was not obedient even though there was plenty of outward show. We cannot deceive Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are many today who have dedicated themselves to God, but for just a short period. Yes, they were healed, but where is their giving “glory to God”? They associate themselves for a few weeks, a few months or maybe a few years with Jehovah’s witnesses, but they do not show lasting gratitude to Jehovah for being cleansed. They are not worshiping Jehovah. They do not sing praises. They do not go out to the houses of the people, from door to door, and preach to the people the good news they have learned. They do not conduct Bible studies. They do not even study God’s Word thoroughly. They do not want to worship Jehovah in holy array. They merely associate for a while and then drift away. Like the nine cleansed lepers that came near the Lord Jesus and partook of his blessing for a while, they never give glory to Jehovah for his blessing.

<p><span class="font3">Vastly different is the name of Jehovah from the names of pagan gods, for they rest exclusively on reputed past records; whereas the name Jehovah testifies to past deeds, present works and future purposes. Our God Jehovah is just what he is and determines in himself, the manifestation of his works not being determined by anything outside of himself. He has absolute freedom and absolute independence and absolute immutability. His words and deeds are essentially in agreement with himself. This implies invariable faithfulness. It cannot be said of Jehovah he began to be. for he never began. He always is an undeniable is. When creation commenced he was already there. Jehovah reveals himself by his deeds and commands, his name is a revelation, a memorial, a pledge. Forms and appearances of created things may change, but the counsels and purposes of Jehovah are permanent, never change, cannot be frustrated. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 4,</span><span class="font3"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">How could the putting of the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the paradise and forbidding man to eat of it be an expression of divine love? The Creator knows what is best for man. He knows His purpose in making man and placing him here on earth. Happiness and contentment on Adam and Eve’s part, together with their family, depended on their continued appreciation of God’s blessings. If God once got out of their lives they could not be content, nor enjoy life, because they would have lost the Father’s love, and that is an essential thing to living. What God was concerned about was man’s continuing to live in His favor, in His blessing and in His true worship. So it depended on God's love, righteousness, wisdom and power and upon God’s law’s being put into effect, and not man’s law. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 28</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During the nineteenth century the higher-critic scoffers were loud in their denunciation of the Bible’s position that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, one of their arguments against it being that writing was unknown at the time of Moses. When they had to give ground on this point they did so grudgingly, and arbitrarily said that even if writing was known it was not widely used and Moses did not know the art. But further discoveries made the rout of the higher critics complete. Now it is acknowledged that writing was widespread in Abraham’s time, that it was used by not only adults but children. Clay tablets with writing on them go back to the fourth millennium before Christ, reaching into the life span of Adam. In fact, archaeology indicates that Adam wrote, and along with others such as Noah, Shem, Isaac and Jacob provided written documents from which Moses compiled the book of Genesis, down to chapter 37 verse 2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What a fine definition of what mature understanding means! Therefore, instead of being satisfied with understanding merely the ‘elementary doctrines’, let us by all means “press on to maturity”. After having first “tasted that the Lord is kind”, we must not stand still, but must “grow to salvation”. The emphasis is on the need for continual, steady progress. It does not mean something frightfully involved, something possible only to a select few who have been years in the truth and enjoyed a good education. Here the natural illustration does not apply. For while the time taken for growth from babyhood to maturity stays within certain time limits, spiritual growth is not so governed. The chief determining factor is depth of heart devotion and appreciation.

Our cup runs over, our spiritual table is loaded with solid food in the very presence of our enemies. Poor materially most of us may be, but we are making many rich spiritually.

Today he has massed together hundreds of thousands of his witnesses for making proclamation of his name to the ends of the earth. They listen to his voice through his Word. But in a short while the voice of Jehovah will speak in an altogether different manner. He will speak from the heavens in thunderous tones. The terrible phenomena of the storm in the heavens are an expression of God’s majesty, his eternalness, his sovereignty and his unshakableness. When Jehovah speaks with his voice of authority from heaven, then all the nations of earth will tremble and shake and pass out of existence. Jehovah’s expressions are powerful. Now the time has come for those of sheeplike disposition to heed the voice of God as spoken in his Word before his voice will speak from the heavens at Armageddon.

Such responsive hearts are delightful. Earthly parents find a great deal of pleasure in prompt and cheerful obedience, for it is rightly accepted as the measure of the child’s love. Enforced obedience is not an expression of love. Strict disciplinary penalties for misconduct compel soldiers in armies to be obedient to their superiors, whether they like it or not. Servants have to be obedient to their masters, or some form of punishment results. Jehovah has endowed his human creatures with freedom to obey or disobey that thereby he may prove them, and rewards will depend upon joyful obedience.

<p><span class="font3">It is likely that for the majority of persons who have lived the time for judgment will be in the millennial reign of Christ. However, long before this many persons vrill have had their time of judgment, as the Scriptures show that God has brought certain judgment periods upon men at certain times, during which God held them accountable for their course of action. That they might be accountable at such times, testimony was given that they might know the issue and make their decision, by which they would determine their destiny. One of such judgment periods was the flood of Noah’s day. Another was the fiery end of Sodom and Gomorrah.

True, he showed that on the point at issue the Jews had the advantage, for “we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews”, but “you worship what you do not know”. But though the Jews enjoyed a better understanding than the Samaritans as to God’s requirements respecting worship, Jesus then went on to give a much deeper and altogether different aspect concerning worship. What a contrast it presents with any previous conception ' In their form of worship the Jews were principally concerned with the outward things of time and place and manner of observance; but now Jesus was saying that genuine worship went deeper than the things that are seen, and it must be “with spirit and truth” ; which means not only clean, but mature, worship.

Neither can others make you grow to maturity. You cannot even make yourself grow. It is God who ‘keeps making it grow’, and, looking at ourselves, we are forced to admit, ‘just how, we do not know.’ It is certainly not due to any credit we can claim.

A true </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">principle</span><span class="font3"> is a fundamental truth. Since truth conforms to fact or is that which is in accordance with the actual state of things, principles essentially are statements of basic facts. The Bible contains thousands of these principles expressly stated, while others are deduced or found in the book of nature. Among those found in the Bible are: ‘God formed the earth to be inhabited.’ ‘Man is mortal.’ ‘The soul that sins dies.’ ‘God is rich in mercy.’ ‘Life of the flesh is in the blood.’ ‘Jesus was made perfect flesh.’ ‘Jesus’ lifeblood purchased man’s everlasting release from death.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 8a</span></p>

(Jas. 2:1-4) Jesus was the example for the congregation and he showed his lowliness of mind by washing the feet of the disciples on the night of the last passover and at the introduction of the memorial of his death. Here he was showing how they must humble themselves and be slaves to their brothers. These apostles were not to lord it over the flock, but they were to be shepherds and care for the visible organization. These special representatives were to help all the individuals in the congregation to see their responsibility to be ministers. Accomplishing this means the making of a strong organization of brothers, and then great work can be done in the interest of God’s kingdom.

When God organized the theocratic nation of Israel this parental responsibility was incorporated as part of the law of the land. It enjoined upon the parents to train their children in early childhood as to their duty toward God the great Life-giver. This was important for the nation, for it guaranteed that the nation’s future citizens would be lovers of God and the nation would thus continue to walk in his wholesome way.

They have no place in the congregation of God. Christ Jesus even disfellowships on what we probably might think little grounds. Just because a person is lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, Christ Jesus spews him out. Well, that is dis-fellowshiping. Christ Jesus is not going to have any lukewarm persons permanently in his organization. You are either for him or against him. You will either come into the congregation of God and be his minister or eventually go out into the Devil’s organization. You cannot pussyfoot. You cannot be lukewarm. You cannot be passive. You have to be positively for God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3">2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Certain Bible prophecies were transmitted by angelic interview. In such cases there was face-to-face communication between a prophet and a spirit messenger sent by God to convey the revelation. Angels visited Abraham concerning the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Gen. 18:1621) An angel spoke to Moses out of the “fiery flame of a thornbush” and gave him the prophecy concerning the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and their possessing the Promised Land. (Ex. 3:1-8; Acts 7 : 30-34, A'W) The angel Gabriel appeared to Zechariah, the priest, and foretold that he was to be the father of John the Baptist. (Luke 1:11-13) This same angel also appeared to Mary foretelling that she would give birth to a son who was destined to sit forever on David’s throne. So angels effectively transmitted prophetic messages. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It was once stated that Jesus in baptism “consecrated his being to God a living sacrifice”, but now we appreciate more clearly that Jesus, at his baptism, did not consecrate himself to the priesthood and install himself in the sacrificial office. It was God who glorified him by making him a royal High Priest. God did this by the sworn oath which he had prophetically given at Psalm 110:4 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(AS,</span><span class="font3"> mar.): “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.” Since Jesus was miraculously born one of God’s chosen people and was then presented to God in babyhood by Mary as her first-born son, we can avoid confusion by calling Jesus’ coming to do God’s will his dedication of himself to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What will we do when meeting with the many trials today? Must we try to run away from these problems and persecutions, or go to our brothers and keep on telling them what a hard lot we have? Surely not. Everyone must have that deep conscious satisfaction that the will of Jehovah is being done, and that there is complete submission to God’s will in the heart. There may be times when because of your trials tears will be in your eyes, but deep down in your heart you are grateful and even in the suffering you would not ask for it to be different. Be willing and joyful in your complete obedience to Jehovah’s purposes. When the Lord Jesus was suffering so cruelly before Herod and the Romans, he knew he was drinking the cup his Father purposed for him to drink, and so there was no murmuring, no complaining, but obedience even to death, and obedience led to life. He is our model. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The inhabitants of all nations should know the divine name in their own languages. Religionists of modern days may do what they will with God's name, Jehovah, but the Great Ruler will see to it that his people proclaim his name and make it known. Nothing will stop Almighty God from making his name known throughout all the earth, for he himself says: “I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.” Jehovah knows that the clergy of Christendom are serving this old system of things, which he himself is going to destroy at the battle of Armageddon. They are certainly not serving him. That is why Jehovah's Word says to those that love him: “Get out of her, my people.” The time has come for all persons to make a decision as to whose side they are going to be on, Jehovah’s or that of those who are against Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">XW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we witness Jehovah directing events, causing the transfiguration vision to first appear to the sight of the disciples, for no one else did it, then at the second presence causing the chain of marvelous events to come to pass, this time through the direct agency of his beloved Son, then the prophetic word is “made more firm”. It is as though God had put his signature to it Yes, what he has promised to do is now coming to pass. His word is our only light. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105, AS) However, it is not the mere possession of the Bible that counts nor even the very valuable reading of it that shows the way to go, but rather the studying of it regularly with purpose in mind. It is a “prophetic word” and therefore we should see how it is being fulfilled. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 23a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered, and after he had been made perfect he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.—Heb. 5:8,9,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The perfect example of obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ is set for the guidance of all his followers who would obtain favor and life from Jehovah, lie said, “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” “I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.” (John 4:34; 5:30, AW) Jesus was always obedient even before he suffered, hut the proof that it was so must be shown in deed. He became a model of obedience to be rendered by all who follow. Suffer he did, though he was the beloved of God. Who, then, shall be free from suffering for righteousness’ sake, and who will complain while suffering? Our heavenly Father is pleased with joyful, willing and ready compliance with his will. No one is excepted. Hence it is of utmost importance that we be obedient or we shall never gain life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The close of World War I found the remnant in a condition which Revelation 11: 8, 9 likens to dead bodies of God’s witnesses lying exposed in the unclean city three and a half days. What poverty ! But God is so merciful, so full of loving-kindness, toward those whose hearts are sincere toward him and striving to cling to him with an unbreakable affection ! Though angry and displeased with them so as to let them be thrown down, Jehovah was not willing to destroy them, which would have suited their enemies very much. For his own name’s sake and in the abundance of his mercy he had other purposes for the remnant of his anointed consecrated ones. So he opened their blind eyes to see that he had promised them deliverance in his Word and that they were to enter upon a great work to be blessed with astonishing prosperity. Every willing heart poured out gratitude for the fresh hope! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 6,7</span></p>

Keep praying for Jehovah’s spirit, always seeking to honor his Word, and stick close to his organization, Zion. In each case when God issued the mandate, “Be fruitful, and multiply,” the gracious words were added: “And God blessed them.” May that be the rich and happy portion of each one sharing in the glorious increase to Jehovah’s praise. “Press on to maturity,” and Jehovah will “bless thee out of Zion”.—Ps. 128 : 5, AS.

<p><span class="font3">There is in these days no shortage of the solid food provided at Jehovah’s table, taken from his Word and suitably prepared for assimilation by the theocratic organization, with the aid of the spirit. If you are sincere and meek and teachable, need you take long in grasping the elementary doctrines? Why not go quickly on to solid food? The thing is, never stop making progress, through either getting discouraged or becoming conceited. From your first contact with God’s organization you have been taught in a practical way through the various study meetings and ministry course how to make progress in understanding. Well, just continue on in the same orderly fashion, following the “same routine”, keeping your eye on those whose course is in accord with the apostolic example. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 20</span></p>

Question yourself: Would I hurt myself in such a way? If not, then you must obey God first. No one can love God and at the same time hurt his neighbor. Your loyalty to Jehovah and his law will give you a clear conscience and bring you reward. Jehovah’s laws are universally supreme. Demands will be made upon the brothers because of emergency situations and dire circumstances, but always bear in mind that no situation could possibly cancel your primary responsibility to the allpowerful and all-wise Creator. Loyalty is on test. Obey God first and trust in him completely and the result will be right. Meditate upon God’s Word and will, and then act accordingly.

Especially when we remember that God, who endowed man with mind, knows how the mind operates. He instantly detects the bent of man’s mind and knows what it will lead to. That is why he gives warning to us against the consequences that are sure to follow. The same applies to the spirit creation, including the cherub who was later known as Satan the Devil. Jehovah knows exactly how evil operates from its earliest inception.

Our course of action or our speech will offend against what the holy spirit is and will diminish or reduce God’s spirit in us. We might not have blasphemed the holy spirit but we might have grieved it terribly. But we might go so far that we are no longer just grieving it but actually sinning against the holy spirit. If we keep on taking the wrong course and grieving the holy spirit we finally come to the point of being disfellowshiped by the congregation.

<p><span class="font3">After Pentecost when Jesus did build up his spiritual congregation on himself as the anointed King, then distinct congregations of Christians were established. Then if this young man wanted to be a real follower of Christ he could not keep himself apart from the company of Christians, but he must associate with some company of Christians and function with them in order to receive the outpouring of the holy spirit and the spiritual gifts through or in the presence of Jesus’ apostles. The time was past for such individual preaching and ousting of demons, and if the young man had tried that he would have been wrongly trying to build up an organization of followers for himself. So the case of this young man cannot be used to justify the existence of numerous sects and cults operating in Jesus’ name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 13,15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The setting of this text clearly shows that the son being discussed is grown, and not a small child. The preceding verses say that if a man is doing what is lawful and right he will live. If he begets a son that is violent, sexually depraved, oppressive of the poor and needy, a robber and an idolater, that wicked son will die for his iniquity. If the son shuns all these sins and does right, that son will live, whether his father be good or wicked. Now, what infant or small child could commit the evil things mentioned or do the good things cited, or be able to weigh his course of action and decide to change it? This text links father and son in the way it docs because in olden days sons, even though fully grown and married, often remained in their father’s household and under his headship.

All faithful men on earth who find themselves handicapped by enslavement to sin, death and corruption are promised to receive, in God’s due time, in fullness a “glorious freedom” like his. God created none of his servants to bondage. While he grants them the gift of free will, their freedom is relative ; it does not exist apart from Jehovah. Hence spirit creatures and men have what is described as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">relative freedom. </span><span class="font3">Their field of acting at will is hedged in or limited by boundaries. Their freedom lies in living and acting in harmony with the laws and conditions which Jehovah has made to apply to them.

<p><span class="font3">Obedience is expressed through appreciation and doing what the One who is blessing you wants. It would be for man’s own good to do what God wanted him to do. If man was appreciative, gracious and loving toward his Father, he would do exactly what his Creator wanted done. What did man have? Nothing except what God had given him, and everything he had was for his own good. Man should therefore have love and appreciation for his Maker. He must observe the principles God set forth for man and abide by those principles. Man must remember it is Jehovah God who is the Lawgiver, giving the directions for the course of action man is to take. Man should respect these laws and commandments of God. So God put a simple test upon man. It was one of obedience as regards his eating. By just staying away from that forbidden tree man certainly could have shown he appreciated and loved God.

<p><span class="font3">If the world God loves so much was something far future from the day when Jesus spoke, why did he speak of God's loving it in the past tense? Because God not only determined and set his mind on that new world order as soon as the need arose, away back at the time of the rebellion in Eden, but also set his heart upon it with unbreakable attachment and devotion. From the very commencement he loved it so much that he arranged and foretold long in advance the chief means by which it would become effective, the promised seed of his woman. His love was so groat and unselfish that he gladly arranged and foretold concerning the bruising of the heel of that seed bv the serpent. Not that God rejoices in the suffering of the seed for suffering's sake; but, as beautifully explained, to “make his soul an offering for sin”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the self-given name of the Creator, denoting personality. There is only one Jehovah. Never do we read of ‘the Jehovah of Israel’ or the ‘living Jehovah’, for Jehovah lives. The name allows of no limitations. The most distinctive attributes of the name are self-existence, unchangeableness, and eternity. He revealed himself to Moses. The name “I AM” is from the same Hebrew root word as Jehovah. Other renderings of the full phrase are “I am because I am”; “I am who am” ; “I will be that I will be.” Every living creature, visible or invisible, is or exists by reason of some provision made by Jehovah, but ‘He is because he is’. In this sense no one else </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is.</span><span class="font3"> These definitions clearly show the idea of independent existence, uncontrolled will and action.

You mark how good he has been to his people at this end of the world, how he has shown his loving-kindness in doing mighty acts of liberation and of reorganization for them. They are no longer in solitary confinement, prevented by enemy power from expanding with more publishers of God’s kingdom and praisers of his name. Their growth in numbers excites amazement. How, then, can we, who longed to see and share the prosperity of his chosen nation, resist the call to praise Jehovah and to give thanks publicly for his goodness?

<p><span class="font3">This rendering of the Hebrew tetragrammaton does not give any distinction or sovereignty or supremacy to the Highest Person in all the universe. “Lord” to the ordinary person of today has many meanings. Why try to make the Sovereign Ruler a common individual or less than that by not letting the people of the world know his real name or say that he has no real name? Why hide it? Why let people think that God Almighty is just another master, ruler or nobleman, by letting the tetragrammaton read as a title, “the Lord,” instead of giving him an actual name? Why this degrading of God’s name by the removal of it? However, such translation cannot destroy the name of the only true God of the universe, Jehovah, because Jehovah’s witnesses are still alive, and they will be busier and more energetic than ever announcing and making known Jehovah’s name to all kindreds and tongues in all nations of the earth.

They were once chosen to be God’s name-people, but now when Jehovah had revealed the sacred secret, his Son Christ Jesus as the Messiah, they would not accept him. So the way was opened for Gentiles to become Christians, Jehovah’s witnesses. In writing to the Romans about their being shown so much mercy and so much kindness not deserved (for they had done nothing to honor Jehovah), Paul exclaimed: “Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!” (Rom. 11:33, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> It is incomprehensible, but still Jehovah’s undeserved kindness is now extended to the Gentiles.

<p><span class="font3">Man’s rebellion in Eden terminated for a time the apparent exercise of divine sovereignty over the entire earth and all its inhabitants. Then appeared an assumed sovereignty to be discharged by a spirit creature, formerly a trusted officer in God’s universal organization, pictured by a hill or a mountain. Upon this hill or mountain of God are found the high-ranking spirit creatures known as cherubim. These surround the throne of Jehovah and are supposed to be upholders of his universal sovereignty. At Eden one of these cherubs was given the legal right to exercise governmental protectorship over the first human pair and the race which would spring from them. He was set by Jehovah in his delegated guardianship over mankind. The Bible gives a description of this first theocratic ruler over mankind, but who later rebelled, under the typical figure of the “King of Tyre”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Just as Jehovah is the great Teacher of his household, so the father as head of the house should take the lead in home theocratic education.

Daily the theocratic parents should give oral instruction to their children. How better can this be done than at mealtimes? Especially at the morning and evening meals. At the morning meal the oral instruction should center around the daily text and comment provided by the Society in its annual yearbooks. There is always ample material in the comments which the father and the mother can enlarge upon from their own theocratic experiences. These can be related with great practical profit to the children. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 1: 9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is of little use, our claiming to have hatred of all lawlessness, unless at the same time we give practical evidence of an equally intense love of righteousness, God’s righteous cause and sacred service. Do we? And it is likewise of little use, our claiming to have love for righteousness, if at the same time we condone or indulge in something contrary to God’s high standard. (Matt. 5:21-28) We are encouraged to press on toward this same maturity in our attitude by considering closely and looking intently at the Leader and Perfecter of our faith, who endured so much in manifesting his burning love for righteousness and intense hatred of lawlessness. And with what benefit to ourselves? “That you may not get tired and give out in your souls.” That is one of the most valued blessings maturity brings, steadfastness and dependability. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Mark clearly that Paul does not say that a way will be provided for you to get out of your trials, but rather to endure. Do not, therefore, run away from these experiences. Rather have patience to endure. Those belonging to this evil system of things cannot understand this attitude. They will never comprehend what you are really doing, but you know. You appreciate how it proved you and that were it not for your love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus and his people you would not have these persecutions, and it is this realization that brings you sweet comfort, happy rest and quiet assurance. The Lord Jesus said that ‘great will be the reward*.

<p><span class="font3">Can a disfellowshiped person be reinstated, get back into the organization? Yes, he can if he repents. But he has to go farther than that. He must be converted. He must change his whole course of action. It is not just a matter of saying: “I’m sorry I did it; I was wrong.” No, there has to be a cutting of the heart. There has to be a hurting of the mind. He has to show repentance. He has to be sad about it and change his course. Getting reinstated in the congregation of God is a very serious matter, for him and for the congregation. The appointed servants may put him on probation if they want to. He will have to prove to the servants that he is going to behave himself in the future and act properly as a servant of Jehovah. We should be careful as to how quickly we take such a person back into the congregation, because of wbat the “people on the outside” will say.—1 Tim. 3: 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 140:12, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our Christian freedom is restricted by the duties we must perform in accordance with the rights God has granted other creatures. For example : General “rights of the poor” were created under the Law covenant to grant the non-Israelitish strangers and the other poor in the land the advantage of helping themselves to the gleanings in the harvest fields. Thus, ample provision was made by law to feed the poor. This law, being merely a shadow of greater things in our time, pictures, it seems, the right of the poor spiritually or those not true Christians to hear the message of truth as preached by the Christian witnesses of Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, have the important duty to spiritually feed these “poor” ones of Jehovah. God has granted them the right to hear of God’s mercy and to accept the truth for life in the new world. Who are we to deny them that right to gain salvation? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 18,20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">So much of Paul’s writing to tbc Hebrews reflects the transfiguration scene. Even the tone of thought rises to great height, for it sets forth the glories of the new covenant in true expression, and shows the eveningtime of the old covenant. But how grand is the sunrise of the new, and the heavenly prospects thus illuminated! The transfiguration shows the glory of Moses and Elijah and then its fading away in honor, but the voice of authority comes from heaven recognizing the Son and commanding that he is the one to whom they must listen. Yes, though Jehovah did in times past speak through the prophets he will now speak through his Son. The voice of Jesus Christ is as the voice of Jehovah God to his people. Blessed are your eyes if they see and your ears if they hear, for these truths will bring much joy and comfort.

<p><span class="font3">To gain an understanding and appreciation of God’s wisdom, God must first give a revelation and then we must be in touch and in harmony with the channel of his spirit. We of ourselves cannot search into the deep things of God; it is only God’s spirit that can do that. Here we note three proofs of the above statements : (1) the deep truth as to the real identity of the Son of man when on earth was not understood through any wisdom inhering in “flesh and blood”, but only by special revelation by God to Peter. (Matt. 16:17, VW) (2) In Ephesians 3 : 5-9 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font3"> Paul explains how the sacred secret, “which has from past eternity been concealed in God,” has now ‘been revealed by spirit’.

Jehovah has promised it will not always be like this, for the tables will be turned. Then our many foes will be the targets for Jehovah’s displeasure. Today he lets them go a long way in hurting us, but when he rises up to fight, their hateful persecution will come to a dead stop, and their dead bodies will litter the ground. We have only to wait until Jehovah really fights for us, and then there will be complete and absolute safety in every way. Jehovah will defend his people from all physical harm, to demonstrate that his word is true. There will be no question then as to who our God is, for they will know it by what they see and experience. He is Jehovah, and will do what he pleases.

<p><span class="font3">The higher critic says that polytheism was first, then the Hebrews by a purifying process developed monotheism. Archaeology disputes this. The Sumerians are about the most ancient people known to archaeology, and at the end of their culture they had a pantheon of 5,000 gods. But as their past is penetrated the number diminishes. Earlier they had only 750 gods. Farther, penetration takes us back to the time when there was but one deity, the Sky-God, from whom the Sumerian pantheon of 5,000 gods descended. As monotheism was corrupted into polytheism, the true, original accounts were also corrupted to fit in with the variety of false gods. The Bible contains the true, original accounts, and shows monotheism as being first. Polytheism and corrupted accounts followed. Archaeology supports this position, the higher critics to the contrary notwithstanding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

This hatred on the part of the nations is not going to discourage them. They are looking forward to the great battle, this time of trouble, for it means peace to them afterward. They do not look forward to it with an overanxious spirit. They are patient. They are willing to wait until the storm breaks, for they know that between now and the time of the final battle a great work must be accomplished.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—John 10:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The patriarchal shadow regarding the legal obligations of shepherds began to have its reality in the right Shepherd, Christ Jesus, who was entrusted with his Father’s “sheep”. Jehovah’s faithful Christian servants are like sheep once having gone astray but who have now returned to God the shepherd and overseer of their souls. (Ps. 23:1; 1 Pet. 2 : 25) Christ Jesus was sent as the right shepherd to care for these sheep. What a record of loving care and devotion for the sheep Jesus Christ made during his three-and-a-half-year ministry! He diligently fed them on rich spiritual food. Where one became lost he left the ninety-nine and retrieved the stray one. He helped the spiritually poor and sick ones to recover. He also protected the sheep from the wild attacks of the demons and Satan himself. His own death was not for losing any sheep but to save lost sheep. W 7/15 8,9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The apostle Peter had the Jewish view of Gentiles’ being sodomic and doglike, and that is why it was so hard for him to grasp God’s purpose for him to take the gospel to the Gentiles. Yet when he did understand he obeyed, and God poured out his spirit upon Gentile believers, receiving them into the restored congregation along with believing Jews and Samaritans. Thus was started off the fulfillment of Ezekiel 16 : 53-55. Ezekiel did not mean literal Sodom, no more than did Isaiah when he called Israel Sodom, or did John when he wrote that Jesus died in Sodom. (Isa. 1:10; Rev. 11:8) Ezekiel used it symbolically for uncircumcised Gentiles, and when discussing the restoration of the theocratic organization, not the resurrection. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 14</span></p>

We are not asking you to make a special friend of that one, but we do say you should not adopt an attitude of perpetual disfellowship personally, unless the company as a whole does so.

When he created the righteous world he performed it through spirit agencies under the direction of Christ Jesus in his prehuman state. Carrying out his will were angels numbering “ten thousand times ten thousand”. (Dan. 7:10) Yet with all these marvelous creatures there was perfect harmony at the beginning. God does not have to force obedience, but his commands are immediately obeyed. This is borne out by the record from the beginning: “God said, Light be. And light was.” (Gen. 1:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ro)</span><span class="font3"> God’s commands on the first morning of creation were completely obeyed, and so the record of obedience to his expressed purpose continued, one creative day after another.

God had made full arrangement for handling the affairs of the earth and for having man do the things the way God knew it would be best for man to do them. All this for the blessing of the creation. Man should now show appreciation for God’s sovereignty, for his rulership over the universe. If no appreciation was shown, naturally the blessings would be lost. The giving of man the command regarding what he could eat and not eat showed that God would thereby govern man, not by force or coercion, not by fear of hell-fire torment, but by appealing to man’s appreciation, man’s own gratitude, man’s love for his Creator. God rules in love. All he told man was: Do not eat of that one particular tree.

It all rests with our living up to its faithful principles and conducting ourselves worthy of being retained in Jehovah’s organization. To that end we must shun the sins that easily entangle the careless and self-reliant ones. We must not let spiritual prosperity go to our heads and make us conceited and feel sure of ourselves. Do not forget your responsibilities and grow foolish by neglecting them, showing unfaithfulness in what is least. There is danger of those self-conscious of their prosperity disobeying.

<p><span class="font3">Aaron and his sons were not authorized to take over the priesthood on their own accord. No, it was God who first called them and then consecrated them to their office by means of his servant Moses. One of the rams sacrificed in the ceremony of consecration was called the “ram of consecration”, in that it was a ram used for consecrating Aaron and his sons. The basket that held the bread was called the “basket of consecration”. So, after robing Aaron in his glorious priestly garments and then anointing him as high priest and then after clothing Aaron’s sons with priestly garments, Moses consecrated them in a ceremony lasting seven days.

<p><span class="font3">One who knowingly goes beyond the set boundaries of relative freedom commits sin. By refusing to be bound by the right and reasonable limitations set by God, the deceived one thinks to make himself an independent one like God. It all begins in the heart of the self-willed one. First, he dwells on a self-willed desire to go beyond God’s set limitations. He thus is drawn out and enticed by his own selfishness. Next, the desire becomes fertile when action is taken and an overt act is committed by actually going beyond what was forbidden. This wrong action then is sin. Sin or rebellion in turn brings the punishment for disobedience, which is death. So instead of attaining greater freedom by making a break for independence, the foolish one finds himself in strong bondage to his uncontrollable self-willed desires.

That explains the reason for their happiness, a happiness unequaled anywhere in this old world, a happiness that no turns for either still worse or even the worst in this old world can dampen or wreck. Their happiness is not based on any material prosperity nor any armed peace of this world. It is not dependent on having an abundance of the things of this world, such uncertain vanishing things. It is a spiritual prosperity, a real, practical well-being that has transformed their lives and made them the happiest mortals on earth. It will never collapse.

Christ Jesus was not ruling at his first advent. But now his authority and strength have already been demonstrated by hurling Satan and his demons out of heaven and breaking his power; also by freeing his people from Babylon’s imprisonment so that hundreds of thousands are now rejoicing in their liberty. By his direction and power these delivered ones have been preserved, regardless of all the concentrated hatred brought against them. The proclamation of the Kingdom’s establishment is growing louder and being heard farther afield each year, and before the work is done it will be known to be the most important and foremost proclamation in the world.

For they are certainly not “minding the things of the flesh”.

In Scriptural language, it is vitally important to have “the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">accurate knowledge</span><span class="font3"> of him, the eyes of your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heart</span><span class="font3"> having been enlightened”. And we must have our “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong”. In other words, maturity means having a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">true and strong balance</span><span class="font3"> of understanding and appreciation. To illustrate: A child does not possess a strong balance. Even a sudden gust of wind is enough to make him wabble. But that man who has weathered many a storm stands like a rock with his feet planted firmly apart, maintaining a true and strong balance, able to keep perfect balance walking steadily along a straight line. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I say to you people, It will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day than for you.—Matt. 11:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus used a speech construction similar to the above when he said: “It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” (Luke 18: 25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> No sane person would believe a camel could squeeze through a needle’s eye. Yet if this obviously impossible thing were said to be easier than something else, would that not powerfully emphasize the utter impossibility of the other thing? So Jesus forcefully made the point that rich ones loath to part with their wealth would not enter into the Kingdom. Similarly, Sodom did not endure its judgment day, and the Jews knew its fate was sealed. Their opinion of it was the lowest possible. So when Jesus told them that it would be more endurable for utterly depraved Sodom than for them they got the powerful point. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 1:19,20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are impure, immoral, are not spiritually fit for God’s organization. If such lukewarm compromisers or apostates do not voluntarily get out of God’s organization, then under his direction the organization itself will put them out. There is, however, a proper procedure to follow in this regard. It must be an official act. Someone in authority must make the decision and then the person is removed. Paul used this authority in the above case. In our present day we have congregations or companies of Jehovah’s witnesses and we have servants in our companies. These servants must discharge the responsibility that goes with the servant’s position to keep the congregation clean and must take the action. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 4,</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the dag that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.—Gen. 2:16,11, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just what does obedience mean and what is involved in our obedience? Obedience actually means a compliance with commands, a readiness to perform that which is required or directed by authority, a dutifulness. Obedience is a divine requirement and includes a joyful, willing submission to do the will of God. At the beginning of man’s existence God commanded obedience from him. During Adam’s short period of obedience he had a clear and clean conscience; he was neither afraid nor ashamed. Obedience meant peace, protection, happiness, harmony with God, and life. When he was driven out of Eden for disobedience then obedience was seen in the cherubim who guarded the way to the tree of life, so man could not reach it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 2, 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">God answers prayer. In answering prayer he favors, not Christendom, but only his true name-people. Their flourishing condition at this crucial time is an answer to their prayer. He has heard their prayer because it was offered with a right motive and was in harmony with his will expressed in the prophecies of his Word. Thirty-one years ago, at an international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1922, the presence of Jehovah’s Day was announced and the above prophetic prayer was shown to be appropriate. Today, after three decades, we can measure the amount of prosperity He has sent in this his day. Back there we were getting started on the road to postwar prosperity. Today the prosperity bestowed upon us is unparalleled in Christian history. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">While the majority of the peoples of the nations of earth turn a deaf ear to this call, there are many of the other sheep who are listening to the group of praisers in the earth who love to call their God by his name Jehovah, and these sheep are coming to them and joining them in this song of praise. Those whose hearts are right will find Jehovah and know him because of Jesus the Shepherd, and they will be guided to Jehovah’s organization. (Ps. 22:26,27) They will worship before Jehovah, because they know that glory is due to his name. (Rev. 7:9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Jesus their Shepherd acknowledged that there is one living and true God; not many gods, not many lords. And this unique God, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, has been distinguished from all the false gods by having a name which is worthy of praise on the part of all creatures in heaven and on earth.

<p><span class="font3">The trusting, confident ones have their imagination clear and minds settled. They try to be godlike, unchangeable, uncompromising, resolute and reliable, having fixity of purpose and determination to see it through. They rest in Jehovah the strong tower, though troubles increase and all forms of hostility are stirred up to break down the faith of God’s people or attack His city. The loyal and obedient children of Zion will keep the truth, maintain fidelity and remain in the organization. Shortly the greatest time of trouble is to come on this present system of things, but we know Jehovah is with us. Therefore we need not fear. He is our refuge. Just as nothing in the universe can disturb the peace, serenity and tranquillity of Jehovah, for he is the Rock of Ages, so we will trust in him and be safe, not only now, but forevermore.

<p><span class="font3">The service privileges granted to the faithful anointed ones as a class and the punishment meted out to the unfaithful ones as a class are shown at Matthew 24 : 45-51. Matthew 25 : 14-30 shows Christ’s dealing with faithful and unfaithful slaves as individuals. As individuals each one must strive to measure up to the Master’s requirements. United as a faithful company of slaves they comprise a visible theocratic organization and in Jesus’ illustration are pictured as a “faithful and discreet slave”, and this composite slave class must see to it that it provides properly for all its individual members, the domestics. God does not have several discreet slave classes, several theocratic organizations among which the work is divided. “Does the Christ exist divided?” No! It is “one body”. —1 Cor. 1: 13 ; 12 :12,13, Ml’. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">These “gifts in men” were apostles, prophets and evangelists, men who went about serving the congregations. They were given the gifts of the spirit, which were in effect in Paul’s day. (1 Corinthians 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> These men helped the young congregation to get strong and bind themselves in unity so as to be used in God’s praise and worship. Paul, who was one of those “gifts in men”, wanted the visible organization of Jehovah to be at unity, at a oneness of its members. (Eph. 4:1-3) The “gifts in men” had been given for that very purpose. Having been called to Jehovah’s organization and given freeness of speech, then every individual in the visible organization should walk ivorthily of that calling. Faithfulness in service as ministers is required of all, shepherds and flock alike. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font3"> 22, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This seems to indicate that right from the rebellion Jehovah took independent action as to any interests he had in the earth regardless of Satan, and that he exercised overriding superior authority whenever it pleased him. To any of mankind who rendered true worship to him God now arranged to give special angelic protection. God gave his recognition to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and had a guardian angel to guide them in Palestine. As the hosts of Israel moved out of Egypt in 1513 B.C. the angel of Jehovah moved from in front of them to their rear, to act as a rearguard to keep the Egyptians from overtaking them. After the days of Israel’s typical theocracy, when God’s people were captive in Babylon, Michael, the guardian angel prince of Israel, was on the job safeguarding Jehovah’s interests in the earth. This guardian angel of Israel was doubtless Jesus Christ in his prehuman existence. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3">15,16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The terms “vertical rapture” and “horizontal rapture” describe the time feature of the actual inspired picture or revelation. By “rapture” is meant the experience when by vision, dream or trance the holy active force of God ‘bears along’ the prophet’s mind to sec things of God. If while in this rapture the inspired servant is given exalted visual powers to see what actually exists in earth or heaven at that point of time, such is referred to as “vertical rapture”. An excellent example of this is the case of the apostle Paul where he was carried away in mind to see the highest heavens where God dwells. He vividly saw the. paradisaic spiritual prosperity that existed in God’s organization in Paul’s day </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">then and there.</span><span class="font3"> It was not a prophecy but an actual insight into the operations of God’s invisible organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15 22,</span><span class="font3"> 23</span></p>

Our prayers for the last thirty years for him to save us aud send us prosperity have been answered beyond our expectations this side of Armageddon.

There is no longer any uncertainty as to why we have been left on earth since the end of the “appointed times of the nations” m 1914, no doubt as to what our mission is. We have God’s message for today. Once marked by the enemy for death by their persecutions, we know that God revived us from our deathly state and that our foes are the ones who will die at Armageddon but we are now marked by God’s power for life in the new world, even by surviving Armageddon’s destructive warfare. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 12, 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2:2-4, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early Christians prayed concerning rulers, if not always on their behalf, that the work of preaching might prosper. Moreover, prayers that concerned rulers might also be viewed as on their behalf, in the sense that if they conformed to the petitions they would be in a better position with God. If the prayers for just administration of public affairs on the part of officials are answered and lead to a calm existence, without violent persecutions and mobbings, without bans and imprisonments, then they work good for all kinds of men, and not just for Jehovah’s witnesses and the rulers. So it is in the interests of saving all kinds of men and bringing them to a knowledge of the truth that we pray concerning rulers and others in high station. Widespread preaching aids all kinds of men. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 21a</span></p>

The help is there. Use it. Make it work for you in all the meetings you attend. So you believe you could not be a minister, a proclaimer of the good news for Jehovah God? If so, then you lack faith and you will not be a minister. You will not even try. But if you have faith and believe in Jehovah's power and you put forth every effort to study, attend the meetings and take in knowledge from God's Word so as to worship him with all his people, then you will worship Jehovah in his great organization, in holy array.

We must bear witness one to the other. That spirit that we get from the understanding of God’s Word must remain active, it must be preserved, it must be saved. And if this early congregation in Corinth had had this man who committed fornication remain in their midst, or if Paul had not taken action, then that little leaven would have fermented and corrupted the whole congregation, the whole lump. That is why Paul had to take action and clean it out, so that the spirit of God, this pure, holy spirit or active force of God, and the spirit of the congregation based on God’s Word, would remain and be saved, all to the honor of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">freedom</span><span class="font3"> in its broad sense as used in the Bible and in the field of government means merely “acting at will”. Freedom has been defined as “the state of being free; liberty ; self-determination”. Freedom, therefore, is the acting and the performance of acts freely according to one’s will, with or without restraints, for the general welfare. Accordingly, the subject of freedom involves the faculty of “free will” which God as the Creator Superior has given to angels and men so that they can conduct themselves voluntarily in a way pleasing to their Maker. It is in this area of action where man is allowed to exercise his free will that the use of freedom comes in. It is this field of “free will” action wherein governments, both theocratic and man-made, grant controlled liberties and freedoms.—1 Cor. 7 : 37, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3">Let us guard well, at all costs and at all times, our complete and unselfish heart-devotion to Jehovah, which is the very essence of our dedication vows. Like Jesus, we have responded to the invitation : “My son, give me thy heart.” Does this minimize the importance of Jehovah’s work and our part therein? Not at all. It aids us to take a mature view of it, to zealously engage in it with the right motive, because we love him with everything we have and because wc love our neighbor and want him to share in the same blessings we enjoy. Engaging in Jehovah’s service is the essential and constant proof of our dedication maintained. A mature understanding by the aid of God’s spirit leads to a mature worship “with spirit and truth”, and which finds its full expression in mature, sacred service. Inseparably linking the two, Jesus said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font3">13a</span></p>

When we face conditions that threaten our prosperity as God’s people, we simply have to rely upon Jehovah’s strength, while we encourage ourselves to do so by remembering his marvelous deeds recorded in his Word, also his deeds toward us in fulfillment of his prophecies. We must display faith in his prophecies for our future. We need the guidance and encouragement of his prophecies, which he makes plain to us in this time of crisis. It is wisdom on our part to hearken to God’s prophets speaking to us through his Word. It is necessary therefore for us to study the prophecies privately and go where we can hear them discussed, at meetings in our Kingdom Halls or in our various assemblies. If we take heed and seek always the advancement of God's Word and Kingdom interests we shall prosper, for his Word will never return to him void.—Isa. 55:11; 9: 7. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 21,22</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Today Jehovah’s witnesses are the only group holding true to God’s law, his rule of action. They are loyal to the highest authorities in the universe, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and faithfully adhere to the theocratic government, giving unswerving allegiance to it and to its King. They are also loyal to the “faithful and discreet slave”, to the truth and to their brothers in the faith. Loyalty is known only when it is demonstrated, and it is actually revealed when there is trouble, adversity and temptation. Once it is manifested, however, confidence in the loyal one results. Those who want to be loyal must study Jehovah’s Word and learn his ways, understand his principles upon which he acts, and his motives, and at the same time learn bow to depart from the ways of the wicked.

When the battle of Armageddon strikes, the nations of the earth will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah. Now they can hear it through his faithful witnesses, but then it will be too late. There will not be a last-minute confession on their part that they were wrong and then all running to Jehovah’s side.

Well, then, we need to watch all the time against forgetting his mighty acts and loving-kindness toward his nation and at last becoming complainers, selfishly ambitious, immorally unclean, desirous of the things of this world, fearful of world powers, idolizing our own wills and opinions, rebellious, neglectful of our responsibilities inside or under the theocratic organization. Having been delivered from this Babylonish world, we can never return to its sins and at the same time share the further prosperity of God’s instructed people.

As Father he reveals himself as the Source of life, and the kind Provider for all who will live forever. Many wonderful significations are embraced with the name Jehovah : self-existing, mighty, merciful, kind beyond discovering, long-suffering, strong, bountiful, true, preserver and pardoner, righteous, vindicator, and others. (Ex. 34:5-7, AS) This is Jehovah, the One to whom we can go in every time of need, for all circumstances and conditions, and have complete confidence and security, the Jehovah we must know, fear and worship. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 8, 9</span></p>

They were to make up his visible organization, having freencss of speech and a determination to do God’s will. If this organization was to be successful then they must work together. They must see alike and have the same positive views in mind. All must realize that the purpose for gathering these servants of the Most High is to preach this good news of the Kingdom, magnify Jehovah’s name and announce Christ Jesus. Jehovah was dealing with all the body members through his Word and his visible organization, and, what is more, ne is doing the same in this day for our oneness as a body. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 26,25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To the many who have been basking in the proper climate of theocratic freedom for several years the counsel is given, Be a genuine example to the new ones now embracing freedom. By your example in walking circumspectly as to the rights of others and in keeping bounded by the proper theocratic restrictions to our Christian freedom, you will aid the incoming new ones to advance to maturity. They will develop respect for God’s requirements and become more efficient members of the New World society. By conforming ourselves to the present Christian organizational procedures we will be that much better trained to become new world administrators after Armageddon.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 12:14, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A place of worship and sacrifice first must be chosen by Jehovah, and according to law only the place dedicated is permitted to be used. The sanctuary is to be one only, that God’s people may be kept in theocratic unity. In Israel’s day there grew up a multiplicity of places promoting the growth of idol worship. The tabernacle was the center of Israel and the right worship meant the unity of Israel. In these last days some ignore the chosen place of meeting, where God speaks to his people, around the “faithful and discreet slave”, the place chosen and proved so for nearly seventy years. Those who choose their own places of worship and service and teach others likewise run the risk of being completely cut off from the congregation, even as it was with the typical people. (Lev. 17:4) They are disloyal to Jehovah and his chosen organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This expression takes in so much. It is hard to comprehend the magnificent spectacle that takes place in the heavens and upon the earth now when this Psalm comes into complete fulfillment. When Jehovah God had called out the children of Israel as a special people, he had his priests array themselves in holy garments. Aaron’s garments were most beautiful and distinguished him from the other priests. In days gone by when Jehovah's people were marching through the wilderness, he had them array themselves in proper positions. All this was done according to his direction. It was organization. Each tribe was happy to take its right position. It was not that one tribe was trying to be in first position. It was that God had placed them by his own direction. Jehovah was their God and he guided them. He led them through the wilderness and eventually into the Promised Land. They should have worshiped him in holy array. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It was not enough for Jesus to lay down his sacrifice on earth. He also had to ascend and present his sacrifice to God in heaven. He did not take his human body with him, for “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom”. (1 Cor. 15:50, .V1F) He took with him the merit or value of his human life, symbolized by blood. He presented that to God as a sin-removing ransom sacrifice. (Ileb. 13:11,12; Lev. 17: 11-14; 16: 14-16) By presenting his sacrifice in heaven he laid the foundation for the coming new world. For the sacrifice of the mass to be presented to God, the Catholic priest offering the mass would himself have to imitate Jesus and ascend to heaven in order to get it into God’s presence. Since the sinful clergyman priest cannot do this, his sacrifice of the mass must fail to bring about cancellation of sins for Catholics. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3">27, 29</span></p>

The company servant, the assistant company servant, the Bible study servant, and maybe some other mature brothers in the company should be called together to have a hearing, and those who are charged and the witnesses must be brought in and the matter discussed. They cannot come to a conclusion that this person should be put out of the congregation on mere rumor or gossip. There must be two or three eyewitnesses that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">know </span><span class="font3">such and such a thing occurred or was said.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, . . . seven days shalt thou consecrate them.—Bx. 29: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our English word “consecrate” really translates a group of Hebrew words which literally mean “fill the hand”, that is to say, put full power in the hand of those who are to serve in office. In picture of this the ram of consecration was killed and cut up and parts of it together with certain baked goods from the basket of consecration were put by Moses upon the hands of Aaron and his sons and were waved before Jehovah. After that the things waved were burned “on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration [an installation-offering, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AT] </span><span class="font3">for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah”.

But wickedness against God they tolerate. To them personal convenience and liberty are more precious than godliness. They lack the burning love for righteousness and the devouring hate for wickedness that would consume the corruption now rampant in all human governments. Nations operate according to the principle of community responsibility. Rulers may start wars, but the people fight them. Tin nations in their wars sow death on the basis of community responsibility. Will it not be just for them to reap it on the same basis at Armageddon? Can they rightly complain if they reap as they sow, are judged as they judge, are shown the same mercy they showed?

<p><span class="font3">The first great patriarch or family head of the immediate post-flood society was Noah. From the Bible’s account of his activities and from later evidence of his leadership, we observe that Noah was a great organizer of society. For about 40 or 50 years before the flood, Noah organized his family for the building of the ark. This was a prodigious project necessitating the gathering and assembling together of much timber and other materials. All this required negotiations with neighboring peoples, payment in money for goods and services and making of contracts which brought into play rules of conduct and business. Likewise the marshaling together of the host of animals which later entered the ark required planning and orderly handling. Noah, the 599-year-old shrewd organizer, after caring for all preliminaries, went into the ark in 2370 B.C. with an organized society of which he was the head. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font3"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The work before the war of Armageddon is not yet done. Our own salvation is not yet complete. There are numberless other sheep far from Jehovah’s Right Shepherd who need help toward salvation. Our prayers need to rise to God, widening out beyond our own individual salvation and taking in that of these other sheep, many of whom the Right Shepherd must yet gather. Among all nations they are held prisoner to Babylon through ignorance and fear, but deep down in their hearts they long to share in the prosperity of Jehovah’s chosen ones and to rejoice in the gladness of his nation. Until we have worked for their deliverance according to God's will the prayer is not fully answered for God to save us and gather us (not simply me) from among the nations, to thank his holy name and to triumph through praising him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1 </span><span class="font3">23,24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We not only need an intellectual appreciation of the truth but it must really sink into our hearts. The Lord Jesus Christ is “the bright and morning star” and he it is who heralds the new day. (Mal. 4:2, AS) In 1918 some of Jehovah’s anointed realized the King was present and a few years later knew he had come to his temple for judgment. And in 1925 the fact and truth came home that the Kingdom, ‘the man child,’ had been born. How the hearts of the people of God rejoiced! They knew the King and the Kingdom were here, and they have not ceased to sing and shout aloud the good news of the Kingdom. They saw these things clearly and believed them. The morning star had risen in their hearts, and it can rise in the hearts of others if they will wholly concentrate their minds upon the things of the Kingdom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.—Uos. 4' 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If sincerity were the determining factor, why should God bother with providing the Bible? He could look upon the heart and judge on the grounds of sincerity or insincerity, and save or destroy on that basis. (1 Sam. 16:7) Accurate knowledge is necessary, and lack of it has brought to ruin professed servants of Jehovah. Hence God provided the Bible to guide our steps. “Thy word is a lamp nnto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) It is not an unnecessary provision that can be set aside in favor of personal ideas or sectarian creeds. All the religious organizations of Christendom are not merely different roads leading to the same place of salvation. It is the road to destruction that is broad enough to accommodate the hundreds of different sects and cults, whereas the road to life is so narrow and cramped that it allows for no deflection from the Bible’s guiding precepts.—Matt. 7: 13,14, NIC.

<p><span class="font3">In building up the Christian congregation various groups of servants and their specialized services were required, among which were the Christian prophets. These seemed to have been outstanding spokesmen in the early church and are said to be second to the apostles. Indeed the “household of God” is said to be built on the apostles and these prophets. (1 Cor. 12 : 28) It appears these Christian prophets were traveling speakers for the governing body of the congregation in Jerusalem. Not only did they give talks on the fulfillments of the prophecies recorded in the Hchrew Scriptures, but they were also used to utter new revelations of spiritual knowledge which gradually became incorporated in the general beliefs and practices of the early congregation. Many of these revelations are preserved for us in the Christian Greek Scriptures. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15 </span><span class="font3">8</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">But when there is a turning to Jehovah, the veil is taken</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">away.—2 Cor. 3:16,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first necessary step toward dedicating ourselves is that there must be a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“turning to Jehovah”.</span><span class="font3"> That applies in the case of one who has formerly been a member of a religious system of Christendom as well as in the case of one who has made no profession of belonging to God’s covenant people. Respecting the Jews the apostle explained that they had made no progress because “a veil lies upon their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hearts”.</span><span class="font3"> Ah, that was the root of their trouble. It was not that they lacked the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mental ability,</span><span class="font3"> but they had not the proper </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heart desire,</span><span class="font3"> which would be manifested by a spirit of faith and humility. Klsewhere, the same apostle puts his finger on the root cause of the wrong heart attitude when warning his Hebrew brothers about a “wicked heart lacking faith by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">drawing away</span><span class="font3"> from the living God”.

<p><span class="font3">For increase in growth both individually and as an organization, the factor of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">unity and co-operation</span><span class="font3"> is most essential. Take the picture of God’s city, Zion or Jerusalem. Psalm 122 says that it is “a city that is compact together”. Because Jehovah’s house, the temple, is therein, it is the center of united worship. It is also the governing center for the whole nation, with its throne of judgment and of the reigning King. It is not a silent city; it resounds with praise and thanksgiving. Jehovah’s people flock to it for that very purpose. This is the strong bond that unites all true Israelites, both the “brethren” (the spiritual house) and their “companions”, their “friends”, constraining all to continually seek and pray for its peace and prosperity, knowing “they shall prosper who love thee”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

What should we do in such circumstances? Encourage ourselves in Jehovah’s name by calling to mind what it means and what is involved in it. It is very necessary to encourage and strengthen ourselves by calling to mind the course we have taken, how it was tested to the best of our ability to make sure it was in harmony with God’s will, and, being assured, we stand firm. Then trust, be confident, do not doubt, realize fully the name Jehovah can be relied upon as a strong tower, and in it we are safe. Remember how the name Jehovah stands for the Eternal One. He who does whatever he pleases, the allpowerful, all-wise, ever-loving Supreme Sovereign, this God is our God, our protector at all times.

In response to his rescue of them from a death by spiritual famine they respond like those famine-stricken Egyptians: “You have kept us alive; let us win the favor of ray lord, and we will be slaves of Pharao.” So these other sheep have become State slaves, Kingdom slaves. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the greatest organizer and he taught his Son Christ Jesus how to organize. When on earth Christ selected disciples and taught them how to gather more workers. At that time it meant a “little flock” ; now it means the gathering of a “great crowd” of other sheep. To assemble the “little flock” Jesus, by meting out the gifts of the spirit to his followers, arranged for organizing the congregation and developed that into a strong working unit, with competent servants. Today this visible organization is also being used to aid the “great crowd” of other sheep. These are not the “little flock”, but they must be brought to maturity in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God. They will gain life under the heavenly kingdom in the new world of righteousness.

Not only will there be almost an endless building program for the civilization of the survivors, but think of the multitudes who will come back in the resurrection who will have to be provided with homes, food and clothing. It seems reasonable that all of these necessities would have to be produced ahead of time to give the resurrected ones a decent reception in a land of plenty. So every young man and young woman shonld prepare now for a full share in building the enduring Paradise civilization that will stand forever as a tribute to Jehovah’s goodness.

Even Christendom wants to have many gods and lords, and she wants the sons of these many gods to be satisfied with her recent product, the new Revised Standard Version Bible.

<p><span class="font3">Subjection to the “superior authorities” is a matter of humbleness. We recognize our greatly inferior position before the living God. We realize that we are totally dependent upon him for life and all its present and future boundless blessings. With the increasing knowledge of his Word our proper appreciation of this subjection is increased. It is reflected not only in our preaching activities, but in our association as wide-awake members of the New World society and in our domestic spheres of life also. Subjecting ourselves to the true superior authorities produces a loving relationship which is one of divine favor. So let us be in total subjection to the new world government. Let us go all out to make that new world course a success. Let us daily live and conform ourselves as in the new world and enjoy now to the full the fruits and the peace of new world adoption.

<p><span class="font3">To be marked in the way that God approves means life. It opens up the way for us to survive Armageddon and enter into his new world. To he thus marked we must become the slaves, the devoted servants, of the God of the new world. We must have the identification mark which unmistakably shows everybody we meet that we belong to the Most High God, Jehovah. Our choice must be between the mighty god of this old world and the Almighty God of the everlasting new world. Whose service is bound to pay the best wages, to afford worth-while reward? Why, of course, that of the true God, Jehovah. Deciding to be marked for life in that new world, it is now urgent upon us to devote ourselves to Jehovah God and belong to him. How? By dedicating ourselves to him through his Son and High Priest, Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 4, a</span></p>

The area of freedom permitting free-will actions, both physical and mental, will never, in the ages to come, be fully occupied by the accomplishments of the individuals of that status. At the end of the thousand-year rule by Christ, when God’s earthly subjects come into full possession of their ‘glorious freedom as children of God’, then they will commence exploits which will absorb every fully developed ingenuity, art and talent of the perfect man.

<p><span class="font3">Sometimes a person’s usefulness is hindered by his attitude toward God’s work entrusted to him. He forgets that to carry on the world-wide preaching work much equipment is necessary, and so he allows his assignment at one of the Society’s institutions to become commonplace, like any other job a person might obtain in the world. By losing sight of the grand privilege he has of demonstrating love for Jehovah by willing, joyful service, he may be inclined to murmur and complain, or begin to think no one else works as hard or has as little time to himself. Why should he be feeling sorry for himself? Did he not dedicate all he had to Jehovah? Is he not glad that his life is filled with privileges of service to Jehovah? After sober consideration he will be grateful that he has much to do. Is it not better that way than having too little to do? Of course it is! Let more come, for all we want to do is to serve Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By this illustration Jesus pointed out that he was bringing in an entirely new system of things, and that it was not to be attached to the groups that followed John the Baptist or the Pharisees. Jesus was not bringing in this new system of things to patch up or bolster up or prolong old worn-out systems of worship that were ready for the discard. The previous religious systems could not contain the new system of things, were not adequate for this new system, could not exist alongside the new system, but would be brought to their end by the new system of things. Even the law of Moses was to be nailed to the torture stake as being fulfilled and canceled. The new Christian organization must have an entirely new system of things, permanently separate from the old religious systems that had either failed or passed the period of their usefulness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 17</span></p>

(Jude 13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Jude 7 shows that those ancient cities had their judgment day back there at the time of their destruction, since they are spoken of as having already undergone an execution of judgment, “the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.” By no wresting of scripture can this be made to mean a future resurrection for slain of Jehovah. No remnant was saved from those cities, Lot and his daughters being sojourners, not natives. If those slain by Jehovah at Sodom have no resurrection, then those slain by him at Armageddon will have none, for the former pictures the latter.

Shimei lost his life because he was not obedient to a very gracious arrangement on the part of King Solomon. (1 Ki. 2 : 36-46) So the servants must make the decision on welcoming that brother back eventually. The servants that disfellowshiped him must make the announcement to the congregation, saying that, since this one has repented and they are now thoroughly satisfied as to his reformed course of action, “we receive him back.” Then the congregation should abide by the decision of the appointed servants because they have confidence in them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 23, 24a</span></p>

Christ Jesus, the proved and tested new world’s King, was enthroned and empowered with sovereignty from on high. At last the kingdom of heaven was established. Now for the first time in nearly six thousand years there is in existence, as respects the entire earth, a new theocratic government with ruling right from God the true Sovereign. The “iron and bronze band” of abeyance was removed from the “tree stump” and once again divine sovereignty empowered a theocratic government to take over the control of the entire earth.

It is the willfully ignorant that shut their eyes to its vindication by means of scientific findings and archaeological diggings, and above all to its vindication made manifest by the increasing number of fulfilled prophecies illuminating our times. So study God’s Word, act in accord with it, build on rock foundation, and your faith will stand the assaults of men now and the storm of Armageddon later.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—John 17:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “union” is closely tied in with another word, “organization.” You cannot have the one without the other. An organization is made up of parts, or members, all interdependent, in union with one another and at unity with the whole; a consolidated body. While the word “organization” is not found in any Bible translation, it is a Scriptural teaching. Take three of the prominent illustrations used of God’s people which have particular application right now: (1) the human body “harmoniously joined together and being made to co-operate through every joint”, and (2) the temple built up of “living stones”, and (3) Jerusalem, or Zion, “a city that is compact together,” where all “dwell together </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in unity”.</span><span class="font3"> Surely organization is the common theme throughout these illustrations. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There is certainly no question in the mind of Jehovah’s witnesses that Jehovah sat as King at the Flood. He had everything under absolute control. When he opened the heavens and the waters poured down on the earth, when the flood came in from all sides, Jehovah was in absolute control, destroying the enemy, bringing to nought all the false gods and their sons, the worshipers of the gods ; and there, riding upon the waters, was Noah, his family and all that God desired to have preserved through the flood. He was absolute Ruler; he was King. So will it be in the battle of Armageddon. He will have full control, directing his Son as to what to do in destroying the Devil and his organization and preserving his own people. Certainly Jehovah’s witnesses can have full confidence in the Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah. And while this fearful condition exists in the earth, even while terror is thrown into the hearts of the enemy, his servants will have refuge.

<p><span class="font3">Everyone who comes to Jehovah’s organization, having studied God’s Word, must see it only one way. God never purposed that there would be hundreds of different denominations, each having a different faith, a different doctrine, etc. There could be only “one faith, one baptism; one God and Father”. Jehovah is desirous that everyone who seeks salvation come to an accurate knowledge of these truths. (Rom. 10:11-13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">He wants them to become full-grown, mature men. The only way a person can become full-grown is to gain knowledge, and this comes through education. The false religions are not disseminating this accurate knowledge from God’s Word. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses want all kinds of men to be well acquainted with their Bibles and have this one faith. If they have this faith they will manifest themselves as Christ’s other sheep. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The constant direction over the young impressionable mind is seen to be necessary in view of the truth above stated. Unless properly trained by the parent, the mind of a child is bound to go in the way of worldly foolishness or deadly folly. “Leave not your child unpunished; if you whip him, you save him from death. You must whip him with the rod, and so preserve his life.” (Prov. 23:13,14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mo)</span><span class="font3"> The use of the rod here is not necessarily that of a literal stick but that of asserting the rod of parental authority. Mere words without the support of parental authority accomplish little. “Mere words will never train a slave; he understands, but he will not obey. A spoiled boy sinks to be a slave, and comes to grief at last.” (Prov. 29 : 19, 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mo)</span><span class="font3"> Training sons and daughters today is no light matter.

<p><span class="font3">The resurrection is limited to those “in the memorial tombs”. Only those whose existence Jehovah retains in his memory will be resurrected, which remembrance is symbolized by the expression “memorial tombs”. That is why the bodies of criminals considered unworthy of a resurrection were tossed into Gehenna, where they were consumed, unlamented, unburied, without any tomb to memorialize their former existence. So those not “in the memorial tombs”, or not thus symbolized as being in God’s memory, will not be remembered at resurrection time. What this means to us today is that those now living in this time of judgment and who fail for one reason or another to take a stand for Jehovah, and are therefore slain by him at the battle of Armageddon, will not be retained in his memory for a resurrection. —Jer. 25: 33. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Although miraculous gifts are not in existence among Christians today, Jehovah, the Giver of every good gift, has not overlooked Christians after the days of the apostles. The truth itself is a precious gift that no one has the right to take away from you. Faith in God and Christ is likewise a gift of which none can deprive one. Then there are gifts of singleness and marriage, the gift of God’s undeserved kindness and the indescribable free gift of God’s goodness. But the greatest gift in store for all faithful Christians is that of everlasting life. “The gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 6: 23, A'W) When one receives that gift he has gained the prize of the right to life. He who has that right to life holds it against all others except Jehovah God, his Life-giver, who holds the higher sovereign rights. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The reason why God causes seed to be sown, a vine or trees to be planted is to obtain fruitage to his praise. “Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.&quot; Yes, the heavenly Father, as owner and cultivator, looks for and expects fruit, and then more fruit. That is to say, a continual increase as a result of mature growth. This is not an unreasonable expectation, for he makes every provision through his Word, and through his organization, and by the aid of his spirit, for such to be accomplished. Do not get in a panic because you have only just come to a knowledge of these things. God is not impatient.

Are they not the very precious privileges of Kingdom service that are entrusted to your care in this grand and glorious ministry? Actually is it not true that really in your heart you value these services given to you through the administration of the “faithful and discreet slave”, and that you truly want to render joyful and willing obedience? When you consider your privileges in the proper light, then how can you do anything else than thank Jehovah for all he gives you to do, and render willing, joyful obedience with gratitude?

They know that the inspired infallible Scriptures of prophecy will be fulfilled toward them correctly. They diligently study the visions and dreams of God’s faithful men of old. They can quote and copy the inspired Scriptures and can apply them according to the facts. They can observe how God interprets them by Christ Jesus through the events and facts that he causes to appear. They are then faithful in publishing and preaching the revealed prophecies to the ends of the earth. The twentiethcentury preaching prophets of Jehovah are the ones who are running to and fro over the Bible to gain knowledge of the divine pronouncements which is on the increase.—Dan. 12: 4. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 20a</span></p>

If we do not have God's thoughts, if we do not meditate upon these things that the inspired disciples brought to the attention of the early church and that have been recorded for our learning now, we are not going to have God’s thoughts. That is why we come together as a congregation to study the Word of God. If anyone comes into the congregation to try to upset adherence to that true Word of God and causes stumbling or a division in the congregation, it is necessary to avoid that one. The best way to avoid him is to disfellowship that person, get him out of the congregation, so that the whole congregation may remain clean.

God’s sovereignty in fact operating through this anointed cherub was fittingly described by the lofty tree. When this exalted theocratic ruler of men and animals rebelled by putting at issue the sovereign supremacy of Jehovah God, he was forthwith dismissed from God’s mountainlike organization. This was the cutting down of the lofty tree. To give hope to righteous mankind how glad we are to notice that God in the vision left a stump of this tree. Clearly this pictures the suspension of the office of righteous heavenly rulership through which God will exercise his sovereignty again over the earth.

For 856 years after the flood of Noah’s day the form of human society that Jehovah had dealings with was that of a patriarchal society. A patriarch was a family head. Therefore a patriarchal society was the organization of individuals related by blood, by marriage or by adoption who lived and worked together in a community under the leadership of a male family head.

They received special teaching from Jehovah during their 40-day fasting period. They were raised up for the deliverance of Jehovah’s people from the world of idolatry and false worship. They opposed the representatives of Satan and exalted and worshiped the one true Almighty Jehovah, thus bringing the issue of supremacy to a victorious climax. They were both ‘lambs’ used for the arranging of covenants made to produce a special people, a kingdom of priests. Both built tabernacles where the glory of Jehovah dwelt with them in their priestly services.

Every man, woman and child on earth is and has to be the lowly servant of one of two opposing masters. If you refuse to be Jehovah’s slave, do not sneer at His slaves. You are then the lowdown slave of his opposer, Satan the Devil. You cannot serve both masters. If you hate, and despise the one, then it is inescapable that you must love and stick to the other.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.—John 15:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kind</span><span class="font3"> of fruit does Jehovah expect and require? Many religious sects, both Christian and non-Christian, teach that good living and development of character, evidenced by patience, kindness, etc., are the fruitage of godly devotion. Do not be deceived. Let us see how Jesus himself answered the question. After speaking of the vine, he explained to his disciples (and to us) bow he bad brought them into a very close relationship as friends and had appointed them to “keep bearing fruit”. Finally he defines exactly what he means by bearing fruit: “You, in turn [after receiving the spirit], are to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bear witness.”</span><span class="font3"> He later confirmed this when he said : “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.” Today that means the witness respecting the enthroned King and his kingdom. —Matt. 24: 14. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The vision has its own appointed hour, it ripens,</span><span class="font3"> it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will flower; if it he long, then wait, for it is sure, and it will not</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be late.—Ilab. 2:3, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Aaron built the golden calf, yielding to the demands of the people, Moses loyally stood for Jehovah against this false worship. He took up his position at the gate of the camp and said, “Whoso is on Jehovah’s side, let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.” (Ex. 32 : 26, AS) A decision had to be made, for Jehovah had been insulted and his instituted arrangements ignored. In like manner some now grow weary of waiting, and think that something has gone wrong with the “faithful and discreet slave”, because events do not come to pass as they believe they should. Weariness in waiting betrays many to temptation. If we wait we shall not lose our labor, but those who start things going on their own certainly do, and furthermore they ignore and insult Jehovah and his recognized servant. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ex. 32:29, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since it is God that empowers or consecrates a person for his special service, how can we understand the above text? Note that this was said to the Levites </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font3"> all Israel had been brought into the law covenant at Mount Sinai and after Jehovah had designated Aaron and his sons to be consecrated to the priesthood. The rest of the tribe of Levi were therefore to be the temple servants of those Aaronic priests. So when Moses called out, ‘Who is on Jehovah's side?’ and the sons of Levi took their stand alongside Moses, then Moses told them to give an expression of their being consecrated to Jehovah by slaughtering the apostate Israelites. Months later, during the first week of the following year, the Aaronic priesthood was consecrated and installed.

<p><span class="font3">Higher critics point to the account of the three Hebrews thrown into the fiery furnace, and say such things were not done. However, excavators at Babylon found what they thought at first to be a brick kiln, until they read the inscription on its base : “This is the place of burning where men who blasphemed the gods of Chaldea died by fire.” Scoffers also ridiculed the story of Daniel in the den of lions, saying that there is no evidence that such type of punishment was practiced and hence the book of Daniel is in error. Mere failure to confirm something does not automatically condemn it as false, though the critics think so. However, in this case some confirmation was forthcoming, for excavators revealed a deep pit having this inscription: “The place of execution where men who angered the king died torn by wild beasts.” These may not be the ones the Bible mentions, but they show such things existed.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font3"> something is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">commanded </span><span class="font3">by God it must be important: a righteous requirement, a charge laid upon us, which we cannot afford to treat lightly. It is much stronger than an appeal or exhortation. There is no option about a command from God. It must be obeyed. Another point about faith being commanded is this: God never issues a command that is impossible for the creature to obey. There are ample grounds for confidence in the possibility of exercising faith. There is no excuse. It depends on the heart attitude, the ’right kind of soil’. The individual is responsible to ‘turn his faith’ to God’s Son. And not only is faith necessary to gaining son-ship as members of the “little flock” but the same exercise of faith is required of the other sheep, who can share in praying “Our Father”, with the hope of gaining life on earth.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">32:1,3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To “ascribe unto Jehovah” means that we must give, wc must attribute, the right things to Jehovah God. Is it not Jehovah who gave us life? Was he not the Creator of man and all the things in the earth? What else could we give to Jehovah except our praise? We should be grateful. We should show our gratefulness. So worship him, and not false gods. It is by what we do and say that we can show Jehovah that we recognize his great power and supremacy, his strength and his glory. Today Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the name of Jehovah, and they ascribe greatness to their God. They appreciate the bounties that fall from God’s throne and the blessings that come down from heaven. They are grateful for an understanding of Jehovah’s teachings and for his instructions as to how we are to live today in a new world society.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses can safely comply with educational laws requiring the attendance of children at some approved school up to certain ages. However, these schools are resorted to by Jehovah’s witnesses only for basic secular studies in reading, writing, mathematics and some of the arts. Where a choice is offered, other studies, as music, typewriting, shorthand and foreign languages, will be found to be very useful. In the high schools it would be well for the teen-age girls to take additional courses in home economics or domestic sciences, while teen-age boys might find it well to specialize in some field of technical work. Learning a trade or becoming proficient in some constructive line of business will always be a definite asset for them. Remember the apostle Paul as a youth learned to be a tentmaker. (Acts 18:3) When his funds were low he could always resort to tentmaking to obtain needed funds. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3">5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 4:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, the vital thing was the speaking of the truth. The only place the apostles and the evangelists and missionaries of their day got the truth was from God’s Word. It is the same now. Jehovah’s witnesses today regularly receive visits from mature brothers, special representatives of the Society, and all of these are required to speak and live the truth as set forth in God’s Word. Not only these mature brothers, but the whole congregation of God, must look at things from God’s Word, seeing harmoniously and having God’s mind on matters along with his spirit. By closely associating one with another and by showing love for Jehovah and our brothers, we will “grow up in all things”. If we did not have love in God’s visible organization there certainly would be a standing still and a retarding of growth. When there is peace, joy and love, things grow. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In using this text to support the existence of separate church groups or faiths, professed Christians of today ignore the circumstances of those times. Not all believers in Jesus followed him along with the twelve apostles. Some who wanted to follow Jesus were told to go back home and bear witness to him there. (Mark 5 : 18-20) When Jesus sent out his twelve apostles to preach, his instructions did not include any directions to establish congregations of Christians. (Matt. 10:1-42) They were merely to give a witness from house to house and locate believers there. So the young man who was preaching and casting out demons on the basis of Jesus’ name did not have to be in the immediate, company of Jesus and the twelve apostles, and his being separated from them did not imply that he was of a separate congregation, for the Christian congregation had not been set up at that time.

<p><span class="font3">No communion at all with these persons that are dis-fellowsniped or put out of the congregation. Why? Because this congregation of God must remain clean, undefiled, preserved for pure worship of the Most High. Consequently when that action of disfellowshiping is taken it really removes a person. He is out. If this one goes from door to door we cannot stop him. He has just as much right to go from house to house as anyone else, but this congregation will not give him any territory. It will not accept his reports. He will not be one of those listed as a publisher in this company. He might put his report in the report box, but we tear it up and throw it away. He is not one of us.

<p><span class="font3">Moses the mediator inaugurated the law covenant at Mount Sinai between Jehovah and the Israelites over the blood of animal sacrifices. Concerning this we read: “Consequently neither was the former covenant inaugurated without blood.” (Heb. 9: 18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> According to this covenant certain consecrations took place, God himself consecrating or installing his priesthood. There was no individual covenant with God by which a person consecrated himself, but the covenant was made with the entire nation of Israel through an individual mediator, Moses. It was God’s covenant, proposed and offered by him, and he speaks of it as “the covenant which I made with their forefathers in . . . Egypt”. So he speaks of the entire nation as being his wife and of himself as their husband by virtue of this law covenant.—Jer. 31: 32. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Salt is a preservative from decay, and therefore speaks of purity and permanence. Its unalterable nature shows steadfastness and immutability. If the spiritual salt is not there then there is corruption and decay. If in our sacrifice to Jehovah God we do not have fidelity, trustworthiness and loyalty then we are good for nothing. Without doubt the heat of persecution will not harm any who are loyal, and the testings and trials resulting from the presence of the great Judge will be for the purifying and cleansing of God's people. It is very necessary that we have confidence in our brothers that they will care for the service and be dependable in it. We must be at peace, but this is impossible unless we have loyalty, dependability and integrity ourselves. We must have ‘salt in ourselves’. It keeps us in the service, vigorous, quick, acceptable, thorough and with brotherly love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 19, 20a</span></p>

If we trust, then the eventual results will always be right. Though the apostle Paul was ‘pressed in every way, perplexed, persecuted, thrown down’, he was nevertheless secure. He had an upright, faithful conduct toward Jehovah and the Lord Jesus and all men, and also he had a living faith in Jehovah’s promises. He was meeting God's approval and felt completely safe. He knew what the name of Jehovah stood for, and could exercise confidence in all his experiences.

See, Christ Jesus, the glorious Signal, stands upon the lofty height of Mount Zion, the established kingdom of God!

<p><span class="font3">Communistic opposition or anybody else’s does not dishearten Jehovah’s witnesses. They continue to preach despite all the persecution. They are just like Jehoshaphat and his subjects in his day who sang to Jehovah and gave praise in holy array. (2 Chron. 20: 20, 21, AS) God's people did not slack the hand then, nor will they now, in singing his praises. Now is the time for preaching the good news to the poor, for bringing forth the prisoners and for comforting the peoples by telling them of the God of the new world. Jehovah is his name. God’s servants are offering themselves in his service willingly. With real joy they go forward in their work today in unity with one another and as one man to sing the praises of the Most High. What joy is theirs because they listen to the voice of Jehovah!

<p><span class="font3">To Israelites, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">training</span><span class="font3"> meant to discipline the child according to strict theocratic authority. It meant to subject the child to fixed paths of righteousness. The intellectual instruction must be nut into practice and an indelible impression made upon the tender mind as to its value. It would be like planting and raising a young tree or a vine. First the tree or vine must be set in good soil that is well watered. The child must have a good heart condition likened to “good soil” and then be subjected to a constant supply of the water of Bible knowledge. But that is not all: the tree or vine must then be directed as to its path of growth. Likewise in the case of a child the father and mother must carefully direct its course of growth in a set channel. “My son, do your father’s bidding, and reject not your mother’s directions.” —Prov. 6: 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mo.

<p><span class="font3">Immediately after he symbolized his dedication to God by being baptized in Jordan’s stream, Jesus received the evidence that God had accepted his dedication and was now consecrating him to his spiritual service as High Priest. In what way? Just as Moses on the first day of the consecration ceremony anointed his brother Aaron with the holy anointing oil to be high priest, so God anointed Jesus with the holy spirit and let his voice be heard from heaven saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I nave approved.” (Matt. 3:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> By dedicating himself it was not something that Mary had done for him in his infancy before he could appreciate it. No, but now at thirty years of age it was something that Jesus willingly did for himself.

Then, calling back repeatedly and doing a little watering, maybe cultivating the soil, scaring off the robber birds, helping to pull up the weeds without damaging the precious plant, and finally the delight and thrill of a newly found friend and companion really appreciating the truth and the New World society.

<p><span class="font3">“God is light.” In these three short words there is a wealth of meaning.

In this connection the word “light” is evidently used as a symbol, primarily meaning divine truth and the enlightenment therefrom, but also including the closely related things of God’s favor and blessing, especially the crowning blessing of everlasting life. “For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.” So we petition God: “Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me.” Yes, indeed, the light streaming forth from Jehovah’s face means an endless flow of blessings. These blessings can be enjoyed only by exercising an enlightened faith, rejoicing in the first shaft of light, the basic truth of God’s existence, and then finding “that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him”.

All the persecutions and difficulties they endured; their being jeered by mobs of incensed people and even imprisoned never halted them. Freedom of speech they had gained through Christ Jesus, by Jehovah's undeserved kindness, and it was theirs to keep. No, they were not going to be prisoners again, for Christ Jesus had released them. They traveled to the lands near Palestine, practicing their God-given freeness of speech. Today Christ’s disciples also are free men and they go forth making proper use of their freedom by preaching the truth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 16-18</span></p>

The weight of Scriptural evidence would therefore seem to overwhelmingly favor the conclusion that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> Christ’s sheen must be likeminded, spiritually minded. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When . . . Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.—Ezek. 16: 55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The context here shows that Ezekiel is discussing restoration after captivity, not the resurrection. In the miniature fulfillment the restoration of Judah and Jerusalem came after the 70 years of desolation. The greater restoration started in Jesus’ day and continues now. When Jesus came, preached, died and was resurrected, appeared in heaven with his sacrificial merit, provided the basis for redemption, poured out the holy spirit upon a faithful Jewish remnant, illuminated their minds to freedom-giving truths and released them from bondage to antitypical Babylon, then they were restored to the theocratic organization of Jehovah God. When persecution scattered the Jewish Christians some went to Samaria. Many of the Samaritans believed and were brought into God’s congregation. There, as represented in that Samaritan remnant, Ezekiel 16: 55 was fulfilled. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 10,11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Moses and Elijah of the transfiguration vision were discussing not merely Jesus’ death, but his departure, his moving out to something else, a future, yes, eternity before him. He had said he would be raised the third day, and on one occasion had declared: “What, therefore, if you behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?” His death was a victorious one and it meant salvation to those in the world hearing his voice. The departure of Christ Jesus also meant setting free multitudes of prisoners. (Eph. 4 : 8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> It further meant his leaving this earth by death and then being raised from the dead by his Father and exalted to the glorious position in heavenly majesty in accordance with the prophecy recorded at Psalm 16: 10,11. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 5, 6a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children, guard yourselves from idols.—1 John 5:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The belief that doing good according to one's own viewpoint is sufficient is nothing less than rank idolatry! This is forcefully shown by the case where King Saul chose to follow his own will rather than Jehovah’s will, and to him Samuel said: “Selfwill is Jas] iniquity and idolatry.” (ISam. 15 : 23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Da)</span><span class="font3"> The same position is taken at Colossians 3: 5 and Ephesians 5:5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font3"> where it is shown that to greedily satisfy personal desires is idolatry. To stubbornly hold to one's own will above the will of God, to make it the guide instead of God’s, is to idolize one’s own will in a most ridiculous and suicidal way. Just to do good to our fellow man in accord with what we think is right is not the way to choose life in Jehovah’s new world, but is a falling into the subtle snare of idolatry in disguise, which snare is set by Satan and triggered by human vanity and conceit. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

So, they may have assurance to put confidence in him. The name of Jehovah is an invisible fortress, and by relying completely on what it means we are thereby putting ourselves in the strong tower. But our trust must be entire. His mercy and faithfulness will be our portion if we claim it. This world hates Jehovah and his people. The enemies of Jehovah's people have tried more than once to cut God’s people off by their inhuman persecution, prisons, bans, tortures and deaths. Each time they failed to cut off the holy nation, which was strictly holding to the truth. This nation had come to know the name of Jehovah and what it meant, and was trusting in it.

<p><span class="font3">Here with singular beauty is expressed the heart condition of Christ Jesus and the great truth that all outward observances are valueless without obedience and the servant’s full concurrence in the will of God. Christ Jesus surrendered himself completely to the doing of God’s will. From henceforth all his mind, heart, soul and strength would be devoted to the accomplishment of Jehovah’s will. From this time forward he would claim no rights, for he was wholly dedicated to God's holy service. Everything he had, all human hopes and ambitions, were all placed on God’s altar to be used in the precious ministry, and he gave them with gratitude of heart. Even as he always performed Jehovah’s commands, we must do the same. If we disregard them we shall meet with God's displeasure. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 7, 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">For a Christian to enter the interfaith fold would mean he must tolerate the tenet of a three-in-one God, tolerate claims that God fiendishly tortures souls in fiery lakes, tolerate bingo gambling, tolerate the view that Jesus was not Messiah but an impostor, tolerate clerical hypocrisy and political meddling, tolerate religious warmongering—and so on and on would flow an endless stream of blasphemies that the Christian would have to tolerate in silence. Fearing to offend men he w’ould offend God by tolerating in the name of tolerance every satanic snare that came his way. He would be unfit for Jehovah’s service as well as unfit for any further mercy from Jehovah. (Heb. 10: 26 ; 2 Pet. 2 : 20-22) So by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness let us appreciate and stick with the visible theocratic organization he has set up in our day. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Maybe sometimes we in the congregation grieve the holy spirit. As long as we are only grieving it there is an opportunity, if we repent and change our course of action, to get back into God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But if we reach a limit and get to the point where we willfully and greedily sin against the holy spirit or active force of God, and work against its manifestation, then God is finished with us. Then we are turned over to Satan and his organization for the destruction of our flesh. It is a terrible thing to be thrown out of the congregation of God, but if we are it will be because of our own fault, because of our own wrongdoing, because of not making our minds over, because of not living according to the pattern God has set.

He can exalt his own name and very shortly will do so, but during the present time he takes pleasure in those demonstrating their love for him in this manner. Loving his name means to treasure, guard, defend, fight for it. Such are honored by Jehovah. How keenly we feel the hurt to his holy name!

The cause of freedom will win the eternity of peace. As freedom is the proper element in which God’s faithful creatures can live, those who live to serve God forever must do so out of their own willing choice, and joyfully so. To enable one to make an intelligent choice he should know what scope of freedom there is open to him in God’s service. True, the Christian should not take advantage of his freedom from being under the law covenant to walk carelessly or loosely as to the flesh. But there is further freedom to which the Christian has been called. This freedom has restrictions due to one’s love for God and one’s Christian neighbor. Hence a Christian’s freedom is a wisely restricted freedom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chron. 13:5, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who offer themselves voluntarily to Jehovah’s service must expect to fall a sacrifice to the fire of persecution. As every sacrifice is first prepared with salt before being consumed with fire, so we must be pure in heart, loyal to the extent of making sure it is a sacrifice to Jehovah. Yes, even cutting ourselves off from everything that would be an obstacle to performing our part of the agreement. ‘He will be faithful who has promised.’ (Heb. 10:23) For us to partake of the “covenant of salt” must mean there is no deceit or hypocrisy in our agreement with Jehovah, that we would never do anything to dishonor or betray him. To partake of salt would certainly speak of loyalty. How reprehensible and terrible, therefore, was the act of Judas who sat and ate at the table of Jesus, the “Son of David”! Eating at the same table and yet at that time meditating betrayal! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Let each one heed the warning “not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think; but to think so as to have a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sound mind”.</span><span class="font3"> Why? “In order that you may not be puffed up.” But even apart from ourselves we must be on guard concerning others, such as the “original serpent” who seduced Eve. So let us not make the mistake of thinking that once we have obtained a clear knowledge of the truth nothing can shift us or deceive us. The light of truth is continually increasing, as promised, and that in itself is a test of our real heart attitude, our humility and willingness to learn; a test over which many have stumbled. Remember, it is not so much the knowledge of the truth in our heads that will save us as it is the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“love of the truth”</span><span class="font3"> in our hearts.—2 Thess. 2 : 10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

After his anointing he went forward doing that great work of releasing the captives, or sending the crushed ones away with a release. He pointed to Jehovah’s acceptable year of freedom now from this old world. The time had now come for people to be free from the bondage of this dying old world, and Christ Jesus was showing them the way to that freedom. The congregation of God knew this!

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 22:15, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To properly discipline a child the “rod of correction” must be used. If parents unwisely fail to correct the foolishly inclining heart or mind of children while young and manageable, then in the certain outworkings of God’s purposes a correction will catch up with those children. The “rod of correction” that is used to turn the children from the way of death in disobedience to God does not need to be a literal stick. The rod symbolizes parental authority and power, and applying the “rod of correction” means for parents to exercise that power and authority entrusted to them in whatever way may seem Scrip-turally wise to correct the child. The parent’s grip on the rod of power, authority and responsibility should never be relaxed. Respect for it should be impressed upon the young mind and heart.

If this unwarranted persecution comes to you, it is necessary to have a clear, balanced mind directed by Jehovah’s spirit; otherwise some impetuous or foolish action might be deeply regretted because it was not according to the expressed will of Jehovah for his children. A spiritually immature person might conclude that persecution need not be borne from one’s marriage mate, and that would be justification for getting out of the situation. Such persons would profit if they reconsidered the matter, and tried to get the Christian viewpoint. (Matt. 19:9; 1 Cor. 7:10-13) It is not a question of who it is that treats you this way, whether in the home or out in the world, but rather why they do it and how you treat them and the persecution.

What, then, do we have to fear from having such an unselfish, self-sacrificing, godly Master as he is?

Never do we want to deny his ownership of us. We are determined therefore to resist false prophets. Never will we raise up a slave’s revolt against our rightful Owner! Never will we desert his service and become runaways. We are in love with our Master.

That is why it is so important for us to continually go to Bible studies and meet with our brothers. We must have faith as Abraham had faith.

<p><span class="font3">This covenant is not a personal covenant each believer makes, but is Jehovah’s new covenant with spiritual Israel. It is not over the sacrifice of each saint or person of loving-kindness that this covenant is solemnized, but it is over the one sacrifice of the Mediator Jesus Christ. Those who have set themselves apart to God he begets with his holy spirit and so makes them his spiritual sons and a people for his name. These Jehovah brings into the new covenant through the Mediator Jesus. He forgives them their sins through Jesus’ sacrifice, and he consecrates or installs them into his service as priests, underpriests whose High Priest is Christ Jesus. He anoints them with his spirit to be such consecrated priests. From then on they are obligated to offer the sacrifice of praise and obedient service to God all their days in the flesh on earth, “seven days.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 27,28</span></p>

Jehovah God does not misbehave. Christ Jesus does not misbehave. We have perfect examples to follow. We have good words of counsel that we can heed. So then, if this body, or any part of it, becomes disorderly, the body would get sick. It would not continue being built up in love. A correction would have to be made.

<p><span class="font3">Today people vote into office politicians known to be corrupt, and thus empower them to capitalize on evil-doing. That the people must bear responsibility before God is shown in the above counsel by Paul to Timothy regarding appointments in the Christian congregation. In addition to being warned against hasty appointments, Timothy was told what qualities to require of appointees. Why all this precaution? So that he might avoid being “a sharer in the sins of others”. If he made improper appointments he would become responsible for the sins of such appointees, since he put them in position to commit their sins that hurt the congregation in God’s sight. So the people who either vote wicked rulers into office or allow them to remain in power must accept responsibility for such rulers’ official acts and sins against God and man. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

His desire to be responsible to no one but himself and his effort to exist apart from Jehovah’s universal organization were not the course of selfliberation. Overcome by his own passion to have earth-wide domination for himself and to be worshiped like Jehovah resulted in his becoming the victim and slave of his own selfishness and made him the child of death, utter destruction. He made himself Satan, meaning opposer, and Devil, meaning slanderer of God. From the time of his selfconceived corruption, this wicked adversary has posed as a liberating angel of light, encouraging angels and men to free themselves from divine restraints. He has encouraged others to become satanic and corrupt like himself in opposing God’s set limitations. All who have fallen into his snare have become corrupt victims of deadly bondage to sin and death. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

How do you figure out in that respeet? Are you constantly receiving, but never passing on? Always needing to be helped out into the witness work, and never progressing far enough to help show someone else how to do it? Have you dropped into a static routine of regularly attending the meetings, but never opening your mouth, though well able to do so?

With the three Hebrews the issue was turn or burn, but true devotion and loyalty to Jehovah calms the spirit in critical times, and with exemplary calmness they gave their answer. In calmer days they had sworn to be faithful and loyal to God, and now the test was on. They met it withstanding even the threat of the king and the penalty of the fiery furnace. So today, do not let precious time slip away and then hope for the best under the test.

<p><span class="font3">God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but it will be a blessing for mankind for God to destroy the wicked. It is so foolish for any creatures to turn away from God’s commandments and direction. Why will you die just to carry out yeur own will and way of life? Those who refuse to obey God’s commandments he will bring to extinction, wiping them out. That is what will happen to the wicked. It is essential to all men loving righteousness that the wicked be thus destroyed. It expresses God’s love of righteousness and his kindness to man to destroy those wicked ones from the universe. God will bring forth a perfect earth, peopled with a perfect human family. Why, then, should he let the wicked remain on this earth and corrupt it? It is God who purposes to produce a perfect society of men and women, all in expression of his love, bringing them happiness, peace, plenty and contentment with their perfect life. It is his purpose to fill this earth with happy, righteous creatures, not wicked ones. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 46, 47</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This is a poetic expression and describes the lightning darting from the clouds. Surely, too, there will be great earthquakes during the battle of Armageddon, even as there are today, only much worse. Now is the time to make the announcement of these things. Now is the time to give warning of the impending destruction that is coming upon the world of mankind. Now is the time to tell the people of the coming storm, not when it arrives or after it is over. Psalm 29 shows that the storm does not center itself only around the mountains to the north of Palestine, but it sweeps the whole land from one end to the other, even down to Kadesh in the southern extremity in the wilderness. It shows that Jehovah will sweep through the whole earth and not one nation will be safe. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Where, under the influence of God’s active force, the inspired servant sees a revelation pertaining to something to occur in the future, such is termed a “horizontal rapture” ; horizontal in the sense that what was seen is to happen down the stream of time. Such a rapture would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">revelation that can be considered a prophecy to have its fulfillment in the future. Obviously most of the revelations that are prophecies are examples of “horizontal raptures”. A specific example is the book of Revelation, which records John’s great vision of the day of Jehovah wherein we now find ourselves since 1914. John back there in the year 96 indicated that he, by horizontal movement, was carried down the stream of time in this vision “to be in the Lord’s day”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 22, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All communion celebrations to which consubstantiation and transubstantiation are imputed are said to impart great grace. But if they are the correct discernment of Christ’s body, why are they not accompanied by such divine grace? Why is the spiritual condition of the people of Christendom so weak, so sickly, or even dead? The actual condition of Christendom’s religious sects denies that they truly discern Christ’s body, for the great spiritual grace expected to result from it is woefully lacking. If those hundreds of millions of communicants in Christendom had discerned Christ’s body and had harmonized their lives with it, two world wars within one generation would never have crippled Christendom, aside from all the other blood-spilling conflicts fought during the centuries in the very heart of Christendom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font3"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Men of good will do not receive proper instruction from this old world’s Babylonish religions. Millions of people go to churches every Sunday and listen to their pastors, but after a short sermon and religious ceremonies the people leave with no good news to preach to the world. Maybe they heard a little about some popular book or something on politics. Maybe the pastor did discuss some abstract thought from the Bible. But where is the accurate knowledge of the Son of God? Where is there interest in God’s kingdom? Where is the one visible organization built on love? If such churches were being taught Bible truths, then all their congregations would be trained to be ministers. Yes, since teachers were given “with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work”, it follows that in order to engage in the pure, undefiled worship one must be a preacher, a minister, a servant of the Most High, Jehovah.—Eph. 4 : 11, 12, .Vli'.

<p><span class="font3">2</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: 10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it says that God’s spirit alone can search into the “deep things of God”, it does not mean that we are left inactive. Far from it! In actual fact, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font3"> must do the searching, but must be careful never to attempt it by our own spirit of human wisdom. To gain “wisdom from above”, we must keep close to the spirit, the Word and the organization. In that way there, can be a meeting of the minds, our mind with that of the Creator; and he has graciously come down to our level, so to speak, so that our spirit can submit to and co-operate with his. As the scripture describes it : “The spirit itself [God’s spirit] bears witness with our spirit.&quot; Also, when we are conscious as to how inadequate is the working of our own mind, or spirit, when seeking to properly express ourselves in prayer, then God’s “spirit . . . joins in with help for our weakness”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">At home the faithful Jewish father took the lead in educating his children. The father spent some part of each day in giving specific instruction. The chief device used was that of oral instruction together with repetition and drill. Important Bible passages of the Law, the Psalms and the Proverbs were memorized by both the boys and the girls. From an early age it seems the youngsters were taught to read and write. Correct manners and behavior before older ones were also inculcated. At all times the father maintained order in the household and used the rod of authority to discipline his children and to keep respect. The children were taught the art of singing and some few learned to play musical instruments. The songs learned by heart were those of the psalms which had been beautifully set to music. In this way the many Bible truths contained in the psalms were made their own.—Psalm 118 ; Matt. 21: 15, A'ff’. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If Jesus favored silent toleration of error, why did he unleash such denunciations at the scribes and Pharisees, calling them hypocrites, blind guides, fools, outwardly beautiful but inwardly filthy, serpents and viperous offspring doomed to destruction? (Matt. 23: 1-33) If he considered brotherhood “a divine command” and “a religious duty”, why did he tell religious leaders : “You are from your father the Devil”? (John 8:44, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> To acknowledge them as his brothers would be to acknowledge their father as his father. He would never link up with a brotherhood scheme that would make the Devil his father instead of Jehovah ! Even professed Christians that do not allow themselves to he disciplined by God into conformity with his Word “are really illegitimate children, and not sons”.

<p><span class="font3">When we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah God, then we do set ourselves apart to a holy life, separate, different from the course of this world. Consequently, such a dedicated person obligates himself to practice the clean and undefiled religion, to keep himself “without spot from the world”. (Jas. 1:27, YW) Searching through the Christian Greek Scriptures we do not find either the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dedication</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">consecration</span><span class="font3"> used to designate this step of giving oneself exclusively to God through Jesus Christ. When reading of the early adopters of Christianity we merely find it said that they believed or exercised faith. The formula that those used who urged the people to adopt Christianity was, “Repent and be converted,” or, “Repent and turn around,” or, “Repent and be baptized.” Such taking up of belief or faith according to God’s newly revealed purpose and will was what made them Christiana. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 1, 2, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Right after speaking of the “appointed times of the nations”, at Luke 21: 24 (2VTF), Jesus makes a key revelation at the 27th verse by saying: “And </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font3"> they will see the Sou of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.” The coming of the Son of man in the clouds with power was the great sign of the sovereign-empowered Messiah or Christ spoken of by Daniel and which the priests and Pharisees were looking for. But as to his first presence Jesus said the only sign they would get would be that of Jonah. However, when Jesus was being tried before the Jewish Sanhedrin on the false charge of blasphemy he openly admitted that he would make a second presence after a period of waiting at God’s right hand. When that waiting period ended in 1914 his enemies were put under his feet. From then on the sign has been seen of the sovereign-empowered Christ coming on the clouds of heaven. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 5b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Just as now many see our huge assemblies and marvel at the wonderful unity made possible by God’s spirit, so in the future they will see more than ever the unflinching integrity displayed by us with the help of Jehovah’s spirit. The preaching work yet to be done, the increases yet to come, the persecutions yet to be endured will effect a further, sharper division before Armageddon. Only by God’s spirit will we be able to thus work, increase and endure. Those who fight Jehovah’s visible organization, upon which his spirit is manifest, sin against the holy spirit, unfoigivably so. Those not participating in this opposition but condoning it, or indifferent to it, fit those the parable pictures as goats.

<p><span class="font3">Man is not the only creature that has bounds set to his relative freedom. Since it is written that man is ‘made a little lower than the angels’, it appears that the area of relative freedom enjoyed by the angels would be somewhat greater than that of faithful man.

(2 Pet. 1:4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">Reasonably these glorious immortal sons of God enjoy a vast field of relative freedom conformative to their new creation. Of the resurrected Christ Jesus, the King, it is written, “He is the reflection of his [God’s] glory and the exact representation of his very being.” Truly this exalted one has a relative freedom of great freewill action that must approximate that of God himself.

Let them see and hear us as his witnesses and observe our spiritual prosperity and feel an overwhelming desire to share it. The prosperity with which he has blessed us is abundant enough for the great crowd of other sheep to share in it, no matter how many their number. We can afford to be liberal, openhanded. By sharing our welfare unselfishly with others we shall see the prosperity of God’s visible organization boom yet more and more, despite the worsening situation in the world.

He has opened his heart, he has let you look at it and he wants help. Therefore mercy, love and kindness should be shown to him. If the action does not affect a company or other individual in it, there is no reason to make any notification or public announcement of it. What we must have in mind is this: we can show mercy to those who are of a contrite heart, and we can help them if we want to.

<p><span class="font3">To say Paul was saved because of his ignorance is wrong. Because he acted in ignorance repentance was possible for him ; he had not unforgivably sinned against knowledge or the manifestation of the holy spirit. The world is full of Bibles, and a glance at its pages is sufficient to convict the world’s conduct. But the masses of people remain ignorant “according to their wish”. In some past times ignorance was overlooked by God, but it is not so during a judgment period, whether it be the one in Noah’s day, or Lot’s day, or Jesus’ day, or our day, or during the millennium. That is why Paul said: “True, God has overlooked the times of such ignorance, yet now he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent.” Why? “Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth.” That day for most men will be the millennial reign ; but others will have had or are having their judgment period earlier.

Jesus warned his followers that they would be haled before governors and kings for the purpose of a witness. (Matt. 10:38, IV li') The Christian would certainly pray to God before such appearances, and the prayer would concern the official before whom the Christian was to appear, he being mentioned. The Christian might pray that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian's cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning the minister. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both heart and mind were involved. The heart is the seat of affection and of devotion, the motivating power. For a creature to maintain perfection means loving and unselfish devotion to Jehovah, such as •was exemplified by Jesus. But the “covering cherub” deliberately turned his devotion inward to himself and his heart became “puffed up with pride”. The mind is the seat of wisdom, the reasoning powers. Most interesting is it to note that his wisdom became </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">corrupted.</span><span class="font3"> He could no longer reason straight and reach true and accurate conclusions. He himself, though, could not appreciate that. One of the most important things to realize is this, that sin is so deceptive in its influence. It blinds and darkens the mind.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under the Biblical principle of “family responsibility” where the father or the mother or both become iniquitous, adverse judgment comes upon the entire household of minor children ; as Achan, for example, who committed a fatal trespass against Jehovah. At 1 Corinthians 7: 14 Paul speaks of this principle in the reverse, which might be called “family merit”. If the father or the mother of a family is a Christian he or she brings merit to the entire family of children.. Therefore minor children of Christian parents are indirectly sanctified or counted worthy of protection in God’s sight until they reach the age of individual responsibility. Hence in this day of final judgment since 1918 parents are responsible for the final destiny of their minor children. When Armageddon strikes all minor children who are not under such “family merit” arrangement will meet annihilation with no hope of a resurrection. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 22</span></p>

Did you ever read of Christ Jesus complaining to his closest companions about the trials his Father had permitted to come upon him? Or did he display displeasure and annoyance against the will of God? No, never did he do so I And why not? Because he “kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously”. It must therefore be recognized by all Jehovah’s people that our service calls for patient endurance, and patience means cheerful constancy. At times the trials you have will seem too hard to bear; but be confident, for it will not be so if you will obediently go on and keep committing yourself to the One who judges righteously. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

We can get to know the great Most High, Jehovah, only by reading and understanding his holy Word, and then we shall see how he declares his universalness and gloriousness in holiness. Nothing created is holy in itself, for natural purity or impurity does not coincide with holiness or unholiness. Holiness of the creature pertains to doing God’s will, being the state in which the creature is bound to Jehovah by divine arrangement. Those, therefore, who come to know Jehovah and to be associated with the Holy One must immediately cleanse themselves, for all covenant regulations rest on the principle, “You must he holy, because I am holy.”—Lev. 11:44; 1 Pet. 1: 16, HI'. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The things that are coming announce to us, that we may know their issue. Tell us the things that arc coming hereafter, that ice may know that you are gods.—Isa. fl: 22, 23, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only Jehovah God can cause history to be written in advance. In other words, he can prophesy, can foretell the future. That is the acid test for disclosing godly qualities and powers. Jehovah God declares that this power of prophecy springs from him alone, and that because of his knowledge of the future his people need not dread any unforeseen events. If any wish to vie with him as gods, they are invited to support their claims of godship by demonstrating their power to prophesy. So it is not the ability to write what is scientifically sound that counts, nor is it the power to pen what is historically true that is essential, but it is the producing of that which is prophetically accurate that is vital in establishing it as inspired by God. He is the sole source of prophetic power. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 2b</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.—Ps. 29:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was not only during the Flood that Jehovah was King. He has sat as King and Ruler forever, even from the time that Adam disobeyed God in the garden of Eden. He just allowed Satan and his organization to remain after Satan re-established it some time following the flood, so that God might show forth his power. He showed his power greatly at the time of the flood. He is going to show forth his power again in the battle of Armageddon. So Jehovah will sit as King then and forever, even throughout all eternity. Jehovah’s witnesses will not be in terror at the things that are going to happen, nor are they fearful of the things that are happening now in the persecution that is brought against them in many lands, because they know that “Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge”. (Ps. 46: 11, AS) They are fully confident that the end of this trouble will bring peace, prosperity and blessings in a new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Paul was impressing upon the minds of the Ephesians that there is just one body and that governing this one body is one spirit, God’s spirit. They were all called in the one hope, the hope of being joint heirs with the Lord Jesus in the heavenly kingdom and of living eternally. All had the same faith based on God’s infallible Word, the same baptism and the same Father in heaven. Therefore there should be no difference in viewpoint as far as the members of the body were concerned, but they should all be striving to accomplish the great work of carrying on the clean worship of the Most High God, sharing in the vindication of His name and Word and aiding all people of good will to get the knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. It was done in Paul’s day; it is being done in our day. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/1 27</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 18:15-17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here Jesus says, if you have anything at fault between another brother and yourself, try to straighten it up between yourselves. If you cannot, call one or two others in and have them listen and give advice. If they cannot straighten it out then it just means a personal avoidance between you two persons, you treating him like a non-Jew outside the congregation. You do what you have to do with him only on a business basis. It has nothing to do with the congregation, because the offensive act or sin or misunderstanding is not any grounds for disfellow-shiping him from all the company. Things that have nothing to do with preaching the gospel or keeping the congregation clean should not be brought into the general congregation for decision. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 7,</span><span class="font3"> 8b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">For three and a half years Jesus served on earth in the role of High Priest to which God had consecrated him. Then he laid down his human sacrifice in death. But that was not the full end to which Jesus’ dedication to God led. That he might continue to serve as High Priest in heaven God resurrected him from death to heavenly life as an immortal spirit creature. As such this glorified High Priest entered into the holy place, heaven itself, into God’s presence, presented the redeeming value of his human sacrifice and proceeded to mediate the new covenant for his faithful followers on earth. To them it is written: “Since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with sincere hearts in the full assurance of faith.” So it is now through this High Priest that we can imitate him and dedicate ourselves to God sincerely and with faith. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 31</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If we have gained our understanding of the Bible by feeding at the table set by the slave class, if we have been thereby freed from false doctrines and built up in the clean and undefiled worship of God, we should not be doubtful about his slave’s provisions. After being nourished to our present spiritual strength and maturity, do we suddenly become smarter than our former provider and forsake the enlightening guidance of the organization that mothered us? (Prov. 6: 20) And if the heavenly Father would not give a stone or a serpent or scorpion to a child who asked for bread or fish or an egg from him, are we to take the spiiitual food he provides through his slave into our hands as if we were going to be bruised by a stone, or bitten by a serpent or stung by a scorpion?—Matt. 7:7-11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3">Haters of God and of his people are to be hated in the truest sense, which is to regard them with extreme and active aversion, to consider them as loathsome, odious, filthy. Surely any haters of God are not fit to live on his beautiful earth. The earth will be rid of the wicked and we shall not need to lift a finger to cause physical harm to come to them, for God will attend to that, but we must have a proper perspective of these enemies. His name signifies recompense to the enemies. You get away from or remove from your presence anything loathsome or repugnant that you detest and abhor. You do not want to have anything at all to do with it. This must be exactly our attitude toward the haters of Jehovah. Their motives, opposition to Jehovah and his people, their perfidy and wicked idolatrous purposes we perfectly abhor. With them we have neither part, interest, nor affection. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 11,12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">15: 3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The witnesses stand loyal to Jehovah’s name though today it is reproached and blasphemed. They remain true and believe in him and disregard the dishonor and shame those of this world heap upon them. We are a name-people and must live up to his name, must therefore know what the name means, what it stands for, why we are his people, and know how to praise and magnify it. Yes, we must grow to love it so much that we are hurt when men speak evilly of it, that we would defend it even as we would defend ourselves. Jehovah has honored us with the revelation of his name and planted it in our midst, therefore we have to learn how to obey all commands in that name from the great King of Zion, the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the chosen One, the ‘top stone of the corner’, God’s great Prophet, and he must be listened to and strictly obeyed. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark300"></a><span class="font3">Though many of man’s laws may be based on falsely conceived principles, laws theocratic as legislated by the great Sovereign Superior, Jehovah God, are soundly based on principles of truth. These laws limit the relative freedom of the Christian. Being rules of action dictated by the superior for the conduct of the inferior, the inferior is obliged to obey in these matters. According to these laws the Christian is forbidden to murder, to eat blood, must abstain from fornication, must keep himself from worshiping idols, must not forsake the gathering together in assemblies, and so on. (Gen. 9:4; Acts 15:20, 29; Heb. 10:25, AW) Then let us not forget the two great laws or commandments Jesus gave us. (Matt. 22:37-39) These and the many other rules laid down for us in the Christian Greek Scriptures from the true superior authorities, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, are part of the boundaries of our relative freedom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 13, 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Woe to you, 0 land, when your king is a boy!—Eccl. 10:16, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Children who are allowed to have their own selfish way, and who are provided with everything they ask for, finally get spoiled and become unmanageable. This situation is extremely dangerous, as the heart of the child has been trained to lean on its own immature, unexperienced understanding. As a novice he falls easy victim to every glittering snare of the great adversary Satan. (1 Tim. 3:6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">Wise King Solomon warned against such rulership of mature people by a child, a mere boy. And Paul shows that though a child is an heir to become a ruler, yet while he is in his minority he is under men in charge and not allowed to rule. (Gal. 4:1,2, AW) This was the position of Jesus, Though he was destined to be king of the new world, yet during his minority as a manchild he subjected himself to his lowly earthly parents. Juvenile domination in Christian households is highly improper and should be terminated promptly by means of the “rod of correction”.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By faith he [the patriarch Abraham] resided temporarily in the land of the promise . . .

<p><span class="font3">The patriarchal society was no crude social order. Bather it was a system highly organized, adapted to the nomadic life of those early family units. They dwelt in tents and wandered over the land in the care of their large flocks and herds. The faithful theocratic patriarchs were content to live in the land of promise as temporary residents awaiting the time for the promised Messiah, Christ Jesus, to come as King to establish the everlasting kingdom of righteousness over the earth. There is much of particular interest for us today as to God’s dealings with his servants under the patriarchal system of organization. As God’s legal ways do not change, his legal actions back there are bound to indicate similar ways for the new world system of things. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Bible shows a communal or community responsibility, where a community upholds or goes along with rulers that persecute Jehovah’s people or are otherwise wicked. Did not the Egyptians suffer plagues because of Pharaoh’s hardness? Did not the Amale-kites suffer for generations afterward because of Amalek’s opposition to Israel in the wilderness? King Saul brought trouble on Israel years after his death. David’s sins brought punishment upon the people. Some Bible students relate some of this suffering to ruler responsibility rather than community responsibility, but it does show how the sins of one can affect many. It was unquestionably community responsibility when Achan trespassed and brought a military defeat on Israel. Because King Jchoram of Judah deflected from God the whole nation went wrong and was punished. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Eternal your God you shall follow, him you shall revere, his commands you shall keep, his voice you shall obey, him shall you worship, and to him shall you be loyal.—Deut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">13: 4, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Hebrew word above rendered “loyal” is from the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dabdq,</span><span class="font3"> which means “to cling or adhere, to cleave, to stick”. Loyal is a French word from the Latin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legalis,</span><span class="font3"> meaning “lawful”, the old French being </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">loial,</span><span class="font3"> hence our English word “loyal”, from the root “law”. The accepted usage of the word is faithful in love or duty, being true to one’s word, or of one who in times of revolt remains faithful to his allegiance. It means that which is done in strict conformity with the law of God. A loyal person is one who is dependable, not negligent, faithful in the performance of duty, and in heart harmony with God’s arrangements. This is exemplified in Christ Jesus. He held strictly and firmly to God’s law at all times, just as though he were the law, never deviating. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“Let us by love grow up in all things,” in unselfish devotion and unbreakable attachment to the organization, because it is Jehovah’s. It is not a human organization. It is spiritual, ‘one body and one spirit,’ and you should view the whole arrangement and those in it accordingly. Do not view your brothers “according to the flesh”. It only leads to trouble. You will be partial, favoring and limiting your fellowship to those who appeal to you, and ignoring and being ready to criticize the others. For the sake of unity of the body, subordinate the personal viewpoint to that of the organization in the spirit of keen appreciation of the great privilege of partnership therein.

So they keep going out in the field service, they go from door to door, they distribute books, they have Bible studies, still they are disfellowshiped. Sometimes even after they are disfellowshiped they put in many more hours than they did when they were with the congregation. What is the congregation going to do now with such an individual? We must keep in mind that this person has been disfellowshiped and is not a member of our company. We want to avoid him, we want nothing to do with him. He is a representative of the Devil’s organization trying to corrupt, disturb.

<p><span class="font3">The whole apostolic organization was an organization of ministers. It was not a laity class, with one or two clergymen over each congregation. All this training and instruction then being given was to make each one a fully competent ordained minister. There were not to be any spiritual babes in the organization for long. New ones would be coming in all the time, that is true, but they would not remain babes in the Word, “tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men. By study all were to become mature, full-grown men. There was not to be a division of ideas, with part of a congregation believing one thing and the other part another. There must be oneness in God’s visible organization.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Pet. 1:20,21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We must show understanding, appreciating our relationship to the visible theocratic organization, remembering the fate of those like Korah, Achan and others, who forgot the theocratic order. Jehovah God deals with his people as a servant class. He does not feed each one individually nor does he appoint an individual over them. No individual student of God’s Word reveals God’s will or interprets His Word. God interprets and teaches, through Christ the Chief Servant, who in turn uses the discreet “slave” class as the visible channel, the visible theocratic organization. David approached God through the priestly organization represented by Ab i at ha r, who had the ephod; and a servant today must likewise look to God’s visible organization for spiritual food, that is timely and for directions in Kingdom service.—1 Sam. 30:7,8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 11, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There is a matter to amusingly note from Satan’s brazen conversation with Jehovah as to Job. Satan was not the allpowerful sovereign that he originally thought he was going to be. The fact that God calls him to question indicates that Jehovah had the upper hand. The further fact that Satan complains of the “hedge” put around Job indicates that he was nettled at Jehovah’s displays of superior power, not only in defense of his true worshipers on earth, but also on special occasions, such as, for example, at the Flood, where with no difficulty God washed away Satan’s demonized earthly civilization: at Babel, where God confused the speech of Satan’s first earthly kingdom; and in Egypt, where Jehovah brought the first world power to its knees to deliver the Israelites with a high hand. And in Job's case God placed a limitation as to how far Satan could go in his testing of Job’s integrity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The dedication of self to God through Jesus is included in believing or exercising faith, for “faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself”. Dedication to God through Christ is one’s putting life into his faith. The record shows that those who “became believers” performed works. They submitted to water baptism so as to give symbolic testimony to their faith, and thus they imitated Jesus. They turned away from the world and turned to Jesus as the Messiah. They joined themselves to Jehovah’s visible organization and kept together as a united congregation. They confessed and reported their past practices openly and showed they had repented or changed their minds about such things and that they had converted or turned around and were now going in God’s way in the footsteps of Jesus. This was how they showed that they were “rightly disposed for everlasting life”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Christian tncn and women dedicated to Jehovah depend absolutely upon God for life and its major needs. Consequently it is right and necessary that they render their greater duties to God at all points of dependency. Where the legal obligations of Caesar and those of God seem to conflict, then Christians follow the legal precedent set by Peter and the apostles. If Caesar thereupon applies sanctions of punishment against Christians for following this apostolic precedent in refusing to comply with Caesar’s conflicting requirements, then they will suffer the consequences at Caesar’s hands. They do this rather than be found breaking God’s law or be found negligent in paying back God’s things to God. If Caesar’s law commands a Christian to do a thing which God’s law forbids, God’s servants strictly adhere to the principle stated at Acts 5: 29. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">65: 22, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Jesus’ baptism forward he recalled all his prehuman experience and spirit life. This meant that Jesus’ brain as a perfect man was sufficient in size for his mind to retain all the mental attainments and memories that he, as a mighty spirit creature, had gathered over a period of untold billions of years. This accounts for J esus’ allusions to many of his conversations with Jehovah in heaven which he remembered accurately. Never in the billions of years ahead, it is reasonable to conclude, will perfect man on earth ever attain to Jesus’ superbrilliant mental achievements. So if he never found his course of life on earth frustrated or cramped, then for a certainty perfect man in the new world to come has an unending thrilling life of freedom and intense activity on earth set before him. Not only that but it will be a life of freedom with security everlasting. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span><span class="font3"> 28a</span></p>

Why not adopt the more healthy attitude? Yes, keep making progress in the truth in the way you have already been taught and helped by Jehovah's organization and its servants even though but a step at a time. Sticking to “this same routine” does not mean getting “in a rut” of despair, but it means “walking orderly” by constantly training our powers of perception through reading and study, both privately and with others, by ‘pondering over these things and being absorbed in them and staying by them,’ asking continually for Jehovah’s help and spirit; and also by engaging in the sacred service. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font3"> 9; la</span></p>

We may not take for granted that keeping busy in the witness work and in close touch with Jehovah’s people and his organization will ensure his spirit's operating on our behalf. Take nothing for granted. Concerning every fundamental doctrine and every step and relationship affecting our gaining and keeping Jehovah’s favor and gaining endless life in his kingdom, “let us press on to maturity” of understanding by the illumination of his spirit, so that we may have the same confidence Paul expressed above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire.—2 Pet. 3: 7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Armageddon Jehovah will baptize this world with destructive fire. This baptism of fire was foreshadowed by an ancient one, when upon “Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all”. John the Baptist spoke of the nearness of a baptism of fire which came A. L&gt;. 70, when Rome’s imperial legions destroyed Jerusalem and killed 1,103,030 Jews and took 97,000 into captivity. (Matt. 3:10-12) A final baptism of fire will come upon those siding with Satan at the end of the thousand-year reign. (Rev. 20:9) Like other fiery baptisms, it comes at the end of a judgment period, a thousandyear one. There is certainly no resurrection from that baptism of fire, for it is tied in with second death, the lake of fire and sulphur. So fire is unquestionably the symbol for destruction that is final, whether used in connection with Armageddon or with the end of the millennial reign. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 22, 23a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The rod of correction gives wisdom; but a child who is left to himself b&gt; ings disgi ace on his mother.—Prov. 29:15, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some modern educators teach that children should be allowed to develop according to their own inclinations and inhibitions. This course is wrong and contrary to Scripture. The child duiing its impressionable years requires strong parental guidance and direction. To expose the fallacy of modern educators Paul said that when he was a babe his reasoning was unsound and incomplete. He wrote: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe.” (1 Cor. 13:11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Thus for this reason children are not to be left to their foolish reasonings and mischief-making. Here is where the “rod of correction” is necessary to give that proper bent to the child. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We should always remember that Jehovah’s Word has authority behind it. Jehovah’s Word is right, it is powerful. Believe it. No one should show disrespect for what God has set forth in his Word. It is his voice. He is the most majestic one in all the universe. He is the most authoritative one. No greater knowledge or wisdom is to be found in anyone. He is the Almighty, the Most High; he should have our respect. Now. is the time for the Seople to listen to the voice of ehovah. Now is the time for them to study and find out. Those who have come to know the Word of God certainly should be obedient to it. God docs not ask us to just pick out that part of the Bible w’e want to live by and forget the rest of it. Jehovah is not asking us which part of the Bible we want to believe and which part we do not want to believe. He is giving us his commandments.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.—Rom. 10:10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Peter tells us why God causes a temple or a city to be built. After mentioning both the temple built up of living stones, and also making a quotation concerning the holy city, Zion, he identifies the true believers who have ‘the precious estimation’ as to why they have been brought into God’s city and God’s temple, namely, to be “ ‘a people for special possession, that you should </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">declare abroad</span><span class="font3"> the excellencies* of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light”. (1 Pet. 2 : 2, 7, 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Do not miss out on God’s purpose respecting you. Though you may be the youngest in the family of those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah to do his will, we want to see you as a ‘newborn infant’ “grow to salvation”, to reach maturity, completeness of grow’th and development. The main requirement for such growth is two-sided. It applies to the heart and the mouth. IP </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/1 </span><span class="font3">3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Jehovah’s organization itself, loyalty or disloyally can be demonstrated in so many ways. One may conclude his assigned place is subordinate to another’s assignment, and, by reason of the fact that he has more education and human ability, he feels superior to the one whom Jehovah has placed in the superior position. In entertaining such thoughts, he is dropping the shield of faith and permitting poisonous arrows to enter his mind, and very quickly he may become disloyal. However, a loyal brother would remember who he is, how the truth has enlightened his mind and that all he knows about Jehovah, the King, and the Kingdom has come to him through the “faithful and discreet slave”. He knows that even as Jehovah gave the knowledge of the truth, so he can take it away. So in pondering those things he does not exalt himself against his brother, but will count it a privilege to serve with him. He is thereby manifesting loyalty to the rule of operation.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Do not be afraid of the things you are destined to suffer. . . . Prove yourself faithful even with the danger of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 2:10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of Jehovah’s people have suffered bitterly, and some have been put to death, but the purpose of Jehovah has not been hindered and the destiny of the faithful is sure —just as sure as Abraham’s, David’s, Daniel’s, and many others’. They all died in faith, knowing Jehovah’s name. We all must understand as they did that our interests must be completely submerged in Jehovah’s purposes. As long as these prosper we are happy, whether we live or die, for our everlasting life is assured to us if faithful. No promise has been made that we shall never on any account be persecuted or hurt mentally or physically. Indeed, all the faithful before this time have suffered. (2 Tim. 3:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> But we have been definitely promised protection if we trust in Jehovah with all our heart. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3">7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 20: 25, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus here pronounced a sound legal doctrine which granted that the “Caesar” governments may set upon their Christian inferiors or subjects certain duties of paying tribute which are proper to be paid back to them for services rendered. But in the temporary systems of things in which &quot;Caesar” operates, he may exact return payment only for those limited services for which Christians are dependent upon the state. This was underscored by Jesus’ reference to Caesar’s coin which was called a “tribute coin”. Therefore in this binding legal doctrine Jesus drew a clear line at which one’s duties to the state end. Beyond that line commence the Christian’s duties toward his God. Note that Jesus did not shut out of the picture these greater duties to be paid by Jehovah’s witnesses to their sovereign God, for he completed the legal pronouncement by saying, “Pay back . . . God’s things to God.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Here we have a plain statement from God’s Word that we should get rid of the person that causes offense and divisions. He has no place in the congregation of God. Meetings that are open to the public he can attend so long as he behaves himself and minds his business; we have nothing to say to him. Those who are acquainted with the situation should never say “Hello” or “Good-by” to him. He is not welcome in our midst, we avoid him. If this one should be sitting in a public </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer </span><span class="font3">study and raise his hand, the chairman should never recognize him.

<p><span class="font3">There were ten lepers and Jesus cleansed them all. But was it not strange that only one of them came back to Jesus to glorify God with a loud voice? Today, with all the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses, there are not very many who turn completely aside from this old world and start worshiping Jehovah with his great organization. The responsibility to do so is theirs, because they have knowledge and understanding. Gratitude is a wonderful thing to have, and those who study God’s Word and worship Jehovah in holy array along with his entire organization happily express to their God in heaven the gratitude they have for having received the truth and for being able to see that God’s kingdom has now been born, that the Kingdom is established and is here, and that shortly Christ Jesus in Kingdom power will crush Satan and all his organization.

<p><span class="font3">Limitations have been placed upon Christians to have no sex relations with persons other than one’s husband or wife. (Matt. 19:3-9) Indulging in fornication and adultery is going beyond the set bounds. For those who are married nature calls for the rendering of certain dues that should not be withheld. “Let the husband render to his wife her due; but let the wife also do likewise to her husband.” (1 Cor. 7 : 24, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> The man must live with his wife according to knowledge of God’s fundamental laws of nature. The husband takes into consideration the biological constitution of his wife, which greatly affects her mental processes, disposition and temperament.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 20:6, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is still training his faithful ones for their present and future service, and no one is capable of exercising authority until he has learned to obey and be loyal to authority. Some of God’s servants have not been men of great “natural ability”, but they have had real ability in his sight, and have been thoroughly dependable and loyal to Jehovah and his will. The ones today with whom God entrusts his Kingdom interests are those who have demonstrated their loyalty under test, having that same strict conformity to God's law as was demonstrated by Christ. It must be the result of personal convictions. True, the loyalty of one may impress and influence others, but it is exhibited, not for that purpose, but because of one’s allegiance. Where a group are all of the same opinion and determination from personal conviction, and all voluntarily united, then such is a loyal company.

The fulfillment of some of them is still future. Can we not confidently rely upon their coming to pass in his due time, in view of the record he has built up, the reputation for truthfulness he has earned despite the opposing views of scientists and atheists and higher critics?

<p><span class="font3">The Lord Jesus said, “Continue to love your enemies.” Men may condemn us and still may be forgiven. We do not love them for their hurtful works to us, but there must not be hatred toward them on this account. Rather, the commandment is to pray for such persons. But the situation is entirely different when opposers get to a state of antagonism against God and the spirit, so that even regardless of the facts in evidence of Jehovah’s workmanship and power, they distort them and accuse God of wickedness. Such extreme debasement is only identifying them with Satan the great opposer whose end is destruction. Satan is our enemy and he is also God’s enemy. The Lord Jesus was not calling upon us to love those who hated God. God put enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.

When he breaks them and uproots them they will skip along the snow-covered sides of Mount Lebanon like young calves jumping about. Not just one, but all the cedars of Lebanon will be brought low due to a mighty act of Jehovah God. Not only will the trees be moved, but the earth will literally shake.

So they do more than merely do kind things toward the King’s brothers. While God does not consecrate these other sheep to be priests with his royal High Priest, still he does something for them as regards his organization and service. He has his Right Shepherd fulfill his words of long ago to them: “I have other sheep, which are not of this [priestly] fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>

We may pray concerning court cases, bans, persecutions behind “iron curtains”, and other instances where the work is involved, and this prayer will also concern the officials involved in the cases, and if they react justly it will be to their advantage.

As a matter of fact, a multitude of righteous principles came to man’s attention for the first time when as a revelation the Law covenant was given to the Israelites. For this reason when God brought the legal binding force of the Law covenant to an end he did not destroy the eternal principles of truth which came to man’s notice by means of it.

Not only have they broken friendship and shown disloyalty but encouraged others to do the same. Let us grasp the situation right. There is no question that Jehovah’s witnesses are the salt of the earth, just as Noah was when a world was passing away then. Just as salt saves from corruption, so Noah and his family were a remnant saved. They commenced the world’s population, resulting in the millions who have lived since. No one of Adam’s stock would be living today had it not been for Jehovah’s faithful one then. It is the same now. “In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” —Matt. 24:22, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3">The only ones to come under the protection of Jehovah at the storm of Armageddon will be those who have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah. It will be such a fearful time that even the animals in the fields carrying calves will bring them forth in premature birth. This storm will be so fierce that even the trees will be stripped of their branches and leaves, even their bark. And while all this storm is going on, this voice of Jehovah speaking to the nations in the battle of Armageddon, he says, “in his temple everything saith, Glory.” Yes, all who understand God and who have come to know him through his Son will say, “Glory,” for the glory belongs to Jehovah. They will worship him in holy array. All creatures in heaven and in earth who have come to worship him will be glad in this day and will rejoice, for it means the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.—Prov. 18:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Security, defense and peace are possible through an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s name. This is one of the great truths of the Scriptures, and is so important that our lives depend upon it. For thousands of years Jehovah’s people have had confidence in his name, and it is necessary now for today’s generation to realize it. In olden times a strong tower was built for defense and security. Today we do not require a strong tower of brick, stone or concrete, for our enemies do not fight us with bow and arrow, nor with shells or other explosives. Our defense is not in material things and our enemies are not primarily flesh and blood. Our fighting is vastly different, but we do need security. (2 Cor. 10: 3, 4 ; I! ph. 6 : 10-12, A W) While the faithful men of old had stone towers of great security, yet their real trust was in the name of God, and just as they put their confidence in it, so we do today. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 1, 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for he commanded, and they were created.—Ps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">148:5, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah created us, giving us life. He is the self-existing One. It does no good to try to imagine when he started, for he did not start: he is without beginning and likewise without end. Before he began creation he was alone. But he had great, joy and happiness in bringing forth creations of all kinds, so that today we see about us the marvels of his creation. All things that he makes bring praise and honor to him when obedient to his rules, and that is the way it should be. He has produced a race of intelligent earthly creatures, human creatures. It is natural for them to want to live, because God gave them life and the desire to keep it. Just living is not complete in itself, but living in happiness, living with the opportunity to praise one’s Creator, does bring complete joy to the human creature.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Both young men and virgins; old men and children: let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is exalted; his glory is above the earth and the heavens.—Ps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">148:12,13, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As children get older it is well not to leave them idle. Gradually encourage them to give their own testimonies at the doors or on the streets or to have their own home Bible studies. Suggest that they become vacation pioneers during their summer holidays. Perhaps the desire to become a foreign missionary can be instilled in their hearts in the course of the years. This would mean that after their two years of full-time pioneer service they would qualify to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead to prepare for the foreign missionary service. The highest career you can plan for your children is that of the full-time service as a minister. Work and plan to help them toward that most joyful and successful of careers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">That which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to you, that you, too, may be having partnership with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 John 1: 3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Granted we cannot come into physical contact with the Lord Jesus, or recline on him, as John did. But that was a mere outward passing expression of the real inward harmony subsisting between the two. In any event, any twinge of envy or regret we may feel on this score is done away with when noting that the first reason given for writing John’s first letter concerning “this partnership of ours” is “that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">our joy</span><span class="font3"> [John’s and yours] may be in full measure”. We can have partnership in the same joy as John did. Jesus undoubtedly “preferred” John, as we read several times; but this did not mean an exclusive friendship with John in the somewhat usual selfish meaning of that word. There is no need for us to hold back. Indeed, there is every encouragement from the foregoing to believe that we, too, can likewise be “in union” with our beloved Master, the closeness and depth of which union depend upon each one of us individually. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word.—John 17:20, HW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The multitudinous assaults against our faith that come in these modern times may test it, but if it is founded on knowledge and not credulity it will endure. We must have faith and our expectations concerning it must be held with assurance, confidence, without waverings or doubts. Unshakable faith comes from knowledge. (Rom. 10: 13, 14, 17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> You have to hear the the report of these things from God’s Word before you can build up real faith, a faith that is alive and shows its aliveness by works. That faith is not just blind credulity, but is based upon knowledge, is shown by Jesus’ prayer on the night of his betrayal. It is through the words preached that new disciples to come would put faith in Jesus. Fulfilled prophecies now learned about confirm our faith and buttress the basis for belief. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 19b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.—Ps. 106: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, “we,” I as well as the rest. It is something for a nation to confess its national sins against God. At the close of World War I Christendom, dripping with blood, seething with internal strife, guilty of persecuting Jehovah’s people, Eroudly refused to confess er sins. Hence, as Proverbs 28: 13 says : “He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.” (AS) The loyal-hearted remnant of Jehovah's anointed witnesses did make an organizational confession of their sins and failings toward God. They repented of them in a godly way which led to turning from them and correcting themselves in their teachings and practices. Their organization confessed such sins against the Most High God and the individual members owned up to having a part in those sins. So God reinstated them in his favor and service and prospered them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.-—Deut. 11:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The faithless Israelites on one occasion were told by God not to go out and fight the enemy, but they thought they knew better. No, they were going to go up into the mountains and fight those who were opposed to them. And what happened? They were defeated, whipped, scattered. Jehovah had told them not to go up into the mountains and fight those people. But they were presumptuous and they went up into the hill country against the commandment of God. They rebelled against Jehovah’s voice and hence were smitten. We cannot be servants of the Most High God and carry on worship just for a little while and then go our own way and still expect to get eternal life. What God says is what counts. It is not for us to run ahead of Jehovah and decide things for ourselves. It is better for us to take counsel of God and listen to his voice. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 12a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 am also suffering these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the one whom I have believed.—2 Tim. 1:12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When others try to cause harm remember just who you are, a child of God, a faithful follower of Christ and that these things would not come unless you had been doing your best to serve Jehovah. Remember also that your God is the almighty Creator of the universe, the Most High, and his Son is King of the new world ; that Jehovah has made many promises to care for his faithful ones, and when there is need he should be called upon to come to our rescue. He will be as good as his word. You will find it difficult in certain circumstances to be immediately convinced about this, but trust in Him and find it is true. In trusting you must have complete confidence, not merely hoping that God may do something to aid you but being absolutely sure he will. And how can we be so sure? Simply because </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he has promised.</span><span class="font3"> His name means so much. It means everything and is sufficient for all our needs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 1, 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">So then in your private homes you would never open the door and allow such a one to come in. You would never extend your hand in fellowship to such an individual. Remember, that individual at one time left the Devil’s organization. He was washed clean by the blood of Christ, he dedicated himself to God and God consecrated him for service. He was a minister. Now he has gone corrupt because he chooses to do so. He is sinning against the holy spirit. He is fighting against God. We cannot have anything to do with him. God is the one that is judging him, and he is using his servants in the earth to point that one out for the protection of the rest of the congregation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses diligently work to make everyone who shows interest in the truth a competent minister of God’s kingdom. They will spend all the time the people of good will desire so as to help them to learn what God's Word has in store for them. After these interested persons study the Bible and the publications that are used as study aids, it is not long before they start talking to their neighbors. It is not much longer until they come to the Kingdom Halls. A little more time and they are ready to go from door to door preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Next they dedicate themselves to God in imitation of Jesus. (Heb. 10:5-9) They believe that God’s Word contains instructions for them to follow, sets forth his purpose, and clearly indicates to them their responsibility to God now to be ministers of the good news.—Eph. 3 : 8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Even a child is known by what he docs, as he behaves well or ill.—Prov. 20:11, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two sons might receive the identical training and theocratic education. Yet if the heart condition of the one was evil, no matter how excellent and strict the training, the latter end of such a one might not be firmly established in the ways of righteousness. Esau and Jacob both received the same careful and diligent training ; yet Esau turned out bad, while Jacob came to be a Godfearing servant. Parents arg not responsible for the evil hearts found in some of their offspring. Yet as long as the parents have jurisdiction over such ones an effort should be made to keep stirring the “soil” of their hearts with Bible knowledge, as it might be that the weak hearts of these evilly inclined ones might be transformed. Of children that had good hearts and were wise in their theocratic growth the Scriptural proverb is true, “Train up a child in the way he should go ; and even when he is old, he will not depart from it.”—Prov. 22: 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AT.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6:3,4, XW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who speculate, whether thoughtlessly or rebelliously, can do harm. They place themselves within the danger of becoming puffed up with a feeling of importance, or they may stumble weak ones in the faith. They can hinder oneness of mind and prevent everyone’s seeing in harmony. They draw attention to the creature rather than to the Creator and his visible organization. Their unfounded speculations may spread, raise questions and doubts, and jeopardize unity of action. Theocratic persons will shun speculations and speculators. They will drink deeply of the truth waters, not muddying them with inflated personal opinions and speculations. By all drinking the same water of truth all will see in harmony, work shoulder to shoulder, and march iuto the new world side by side, all keeping in step with the “faithful and discreet slave”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who foretold the future long ago?—Isa. 44:1, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More than five centuries in advance Daniel foretold the exact year of Messiah’s appearing. His prophecy also foretold that Jesus would be put to death three and one-half years later. Other Hebrew Scripture prophecies predicted that he would be born in Bethlehem, of a virgin, be hated, rejected, betrayed by a follower for thirty pieces of silver, convicted by false witnesses, impaled with sinners, lots being cast for garments, be resurrected, and many other points. In fact, one Bible scholar computed that “there are three hundred and thirty-two distinct prophecies in the Old Testament which have been literally fulfilled in Christ”. A mathematician figured out that the chance of one man’s fulfilling all those things was one in eighty-four followed by ninety-seven zeros. The possibility of its happening is so overwhelmingly remote that we must acknowledge Jehovah as the author of these prophecies. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 15b</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Declare his glory among the nations, his marvellous works among all the peoples. . . . Worship Jehovah in holy array,—1 Chron. 16:24,29, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just as Jehovah has an invisible organization of principalities and powers, of cherubim, seraphim and angels, all in their proper station, so upon the earth Jehovah has built up a great organization. God’s servants in the earth speak one language, the language that Jehovah God teaches in his Word. At the same time they are able to speak these truths from God’s Word in many tongues throughout the earth, being sent forth by their Leader, Christ Jesus, to preach the good news of God’s kingdom. There must be unity among God’s people; no matter where we find them in the earth, they must see in harmony, now that Jehovah has brought forth his organization Zion. Even as the children of Israel were organized in their day for marching from one place to another, and had their respective positions in the camp in the wilderness, so it is today. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Some prophecies have one fulfillment, others two, and some even three fulfillments. All this attests to God’s wisdom that he could conceal so many sacred secrets in the limited number of revelations. Prophecies having three fulfillments are said to have, first, a typical fulfillment; second, a miniature (the reality on a small scale) or partial fulfillment ; and third, a complete (the reality on a full scale) or final fulfillment. An excellent example is the above prophecy. It had its first or typical fulfillment when the Jewish remnant returned from Babylon in 537 B.C. to restore true worship. It had its second or miniature fulfillment when John the Baptist prepared the way for Christ Jesus. And the identical prophecy had its third or complete fulfillment in the deliverance of the Christian remnant from antitypical Babylon in 1919 and their restoration to true worship. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 14,16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Through his visible organization the One Shepherd marks the other sheep in their foreheads as his property. He grants them the privilege of colaboring with the remnant of his spiritual brothers. So they have the opportunity and obligation to carry forward the clean, undefiled worship in the earth. By thus proving themselves faithful witnesses of Jehovah they retain the identification mark on their forehead. By this mark they confess openly their dedication to God and his universal sovereignty. Having the divine assurance of being spared during Armageddon, the mark really becomes one of security for them. Surviving Armageddon with the mark, they will enter the new world fully dedicated to God and ready and willing to do his revealed will on earth from that glorious time forward. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Surely it is highly important to understand as clearly as possible the full significance of worshiping God by means of that which is unseen to the outward eye, namely, with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“spirit</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">truth”!</span><span class="font3"> Important for two reasons : First, because “the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting”. (2 Cor. 4:18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Secondly, because things unseen are not so easily understood and appreciated as things that are seen. And from another angle, we might add a third potent reason why it is important to understand, namely, if we are lacking in wisdom and understanding we are going to be unsteady in our ways, as James argues at James 1:5-8. We are also going to be in grave danger of being deceived on this vital question of genuine, acceptable worship of the true and living God, for “when you did not know God, then it was that you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods”. —Gal. 4: 8, 7VW. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Through the serpent, Satan the Devil presented himself to Eve and she preferred to believe Satan the serpent rather than the Creator. There was no love shown on Eve’s part in partaking of the forbidden fruit. Adam showed his selfishness, also, by eating. There was no love in their hearts, no appreciation, no gratitude for all the wonderful things God had given them. They preferred to be disobedient, to make their own laws, to decide for themselves what was good and what was evil, no longer looking to the great Sovereign of the universe who has all power, wisdom and love for His guidance. No, now they would act smart, make their own laws and live by them, be like God. How foolish, for in order to enjoy life a creature must recognize the Supreme One’s law, arrangement and way of blessing, not what the creature thinks ought to be done! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 31,32</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Among the rights brought into existence by God’s grant of privileges is that inestimable privilege of bearing Jehovah's name. In the hearing of his faithful apostles Jesus prayed to Jehovah God, saying, “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” (John 17: 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> The true Christian ministers, knowing the real significance of the divine name, Jehovah, gladly respond to God’s declaration where he says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.” (Isa. 43:12, AS) This privilege brings with it the right to speak as one of God’s ambassadors and to represent him before the rulers and peoples of this old world society. Because this privilege comes directly from God himself, a Christian witness of Jehovah is restrained from preventing a fellow Christian from exercising his right to speak due to this privilege. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 23a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Is there any honor and dignity in being a slave? Well, that all depends upon whose slave you are and upon what kind of one you are. To be a theocratic slave is an honor and privilege. It is a servitude that leads to eternal life. Jehovah is our Owner and our God. Gladly we all, both the remnant and the other sheep, confess ourselves to be his living property whom he has bought by the blood of his Son Jesus Christ. Like the apostle Paul, we bear the marks of it. Hence we acknowledge God’s right to dictate what must be our religion, our form of worship, and we will worship only him as the true God. As against Him we have no rights. His commandments we are obligated to keep and we will lovingly render our sacred service to him, choosing to obey him as Ruler rather than men. We are his theocratic slaves now and forever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12J1 </span><span class="font3">1,16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Everyone has his position in God’s organization and all work together in joy and gladness. The only thing they are interested in is to worship Jehovah their God. Their worship is pleasing to the Most High. They know Jehovah has a great work to be done before he strikes in the battle of Armageddon. The warning must be given to the people. Jehovah does not destroy the nations without giving them due information as to what is going to happen. Jehovah’s witnesses know what is going to happen, so they are giving forth the message of doom and at the same time a message of comfort. Jehovah’s kingdom must be announced. When he says that the nations of the earth will be crushed and will be as the dust in the balance of the scale, that is exactly what he means. Jehovah has declared in no uncertain terms that all must worship him in holy array, and those who do not come forth to worship him he will then shake and destroy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 20</span></p>

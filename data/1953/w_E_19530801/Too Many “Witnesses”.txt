Too Many “Witnesses”
● Under that title the Pentecostal Evangel of the Assemblies of God Churches said, July 13, 1952: “A missionary in South Africa reports serious problems in combating the work of the ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ ‘They are pressing in everywhere,’ he says, ‘with their gospel of a second chance, and a message which does not demand a separated life. How it appeals to the unregenerate African, and somehow closes his ears and heart to receiving the truth of the gospel.” Apparently it does not matter to the Evangel’s writer that Jehovah’s witnesses have no message of a second chance, reject old-world corruption, and appeal to hundreds of thousands around the world who really examine the Bible. These facts escaped the Evangel’s notice, just as similar ones escaped the Jews who brought Paul before Felix and falsely accused him. Perhaps if the complaining missionary would teach true doctrine, the Africans would listen to him too.—Acts 24:5, 6.

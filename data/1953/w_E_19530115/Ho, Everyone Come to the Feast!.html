<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Yankee Stadium will once again serve as a mammoth table before which Jehovah’s witnesses of many nations will gather for a spiritual feast. You are invited to attend. But will you be there?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At the last international assembly held by Jehovah’s witnesses in the stadium, the ‘windows of heaven opened and literally poured out such a bounteous spiritual blessing that there was not room enough to receive it’. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mal. 3:10</a>) Never was so luxurious a table set before so many. The very first day seemed to hold in a spiritual way more than one could contain. There were new Kingdom songs of live praise to Jehovah God, the timely talk “The Way of Success”, the graduation of the 15th class of Gilead School and expressions from the 120 graduating students, and more! Each day brought a pleasant program with new thrills and surprises. There was a well-planned service meeting that stressed maturity into full-time ministry, demonstrations of refutations made from door to door; also experiences of missionaries in other lands. The foreign speaking brothers heard speakers from their native land and in their own language, and branch servants gave firsthand reports of difficulties encountered and of expansion. Each day was punctuated with a chain of mature brothers that offered timely counsel in Christian conduct and ministry. Truly, those present were saying as David of old was moved to say: “My cup runneth over.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who is there to say what the 1953 assembly at Yankee Stadium will bring? Certainly it will not be less in magnitude and wondrous in spirit. And we can be sure that the spiritual spread will not be lacking.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The question remaining is: Will you be there? Do not let petty excuses keep you away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:15-42:14:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 14:15-34</a>) Be sure to secure this one week (July 19-26, 1953), that you may be present during the feast at the Yankee Stadium.</p>

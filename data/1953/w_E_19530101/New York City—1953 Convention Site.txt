New York City—1953 Convention Site
NEW York city is an ideal place for an international convention. Here is why: More people live here than in thirteen large states in America. The ends of the earth are gathered in its streets, for here are found representative people from nearly every nation on earth. Into her harbor and airports come ships and planes from all parts of the globe. Her transportation system is geared to accommodate millions of people. Her 10,000 taxicabs are the latest and the fastest in the world. Overhead are the elevated trains and below are its subways that serve every part of the city well. Passenger trains enter the city on the average of every fifty seconds. It has most newspapers, and more telephones than London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels combined. And it is the television center of the world.
The city of New York hung out her welcome sign to Jehovah’s witnesses in 1950; the restaurants worked long and hard to feed thousands; the hotel owners housed 25,000 conventioners, the householders made room for 35,000 more accommodations. Businessmen were generous and helpful and officials cooperative.
A letter from Mr. Charles E. Quain of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau well illustrates the mind of New Yorkers toward another assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium. Said he: “I am delighted to hear that the 1953 International Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses will be held in New York city. I feel that this speaks well of the reception given by New York during your last meeting. We New Yorkers are still amazed that such a large group of people could join in assembly with such perfect organization as was shown during your 1950 meeting.”
This and more makes New York an ideal place for an assembly. New Yorkers are looking forward to and planning now for the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at the Yankee Stadium July 19-26, 1953. Are you?

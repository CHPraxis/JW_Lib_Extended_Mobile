<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This book is outstanding because it deals with the basic theme of the Bible, namely, the kingdom of God. Throughout its 384 pages all the important Scripture texts bearing upon this subject are brought into view, as the book traces the Kingdom from God’s first promise concerning it through to its complete establishment. Both Hebrew and Greek scriptures are focused upon the theme. The Head of the Kingdom is identified and his activities are set forth. What is the Kingdom? When will it come? How do men today fit into the picture? <em>“The Kingdom Is at Hand” </em>will help you to understand what the Bible teaches concerning this important subject. Contained in the book are complete subject and scripture indexes. It is bound in attractive maroon, with gold-embossed title, and may be obtained for 50c.</p>

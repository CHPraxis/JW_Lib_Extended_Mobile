<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Britain’s Manchester <em>Guardian </em>carried the following interesting letter in its August 29, 1952, issue: “Sir.—Your issue of August 13 gives news of eight hundred Jehovah’s witnesses in concentration camps in the Soviet zone. This does not surprise me as I recently met a person whose home was in the Soviet side of Berlin. She has a sister there who is married to a Jehovah’s witness. The sister writes that her husband, some little time ago, attended a home Bible meeting. He did not come back. Fourteen days later she was informed by the authorities that he was serving a nine-year sentence in Siberia. He is allowed to write fifteen lines a month! A photograph of one of his two children was returned—he was not allowed to see it. This information should interest your readers, whether they agree with Jehovah’s witnesses or not.—Yours &amp;c., H. Barlow.”</p>

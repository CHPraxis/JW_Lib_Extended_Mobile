<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WITH one clean sweep, a large warehouse, an auto garage and a couple of good-sized tents were converted into a food-supply storage room, a spick-and-span kitchen and a cafeteria large enough to accommodate twenty-six serving lines, each about 40 feet by 60 feet. Such were the wonders performed by Jehovah’s witnesses at their Yankee Stadium assembly in 1950. Over 15,000 persons were fed through the cafeteria line in an hour. In a single meal featuring the various dishes four to five thousand pounds of beef, chicken, or fish were required. Up to 5,000 pounds of potatoes were used for each meal, as well as from six to seven hundred loaves of bread, 600 cans of vegetables and 400 gallons of salad. The first half of the eight-day assembly took a supply of 50,000 pounds of beef, 10,000 pounds of fish, 80 tons of canned vegetables, and crates of cabbages, lettuce and onions by the thousands.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The kitchen organization to supply the necessities of the cafeteria consisted of fifty cooks and helpers, including at least a dozen experienced professional cooks. To prepare the supplies for cooking, a large number of women were employed to clean and peel the many vegetables. Professional butchers and meatcutters chopped and prepared the great volumes of meat required. Over 35,000 people poured through the cafeteria lines Sunday noon! The cafeteria meals were in good taste and of generous portions. Its convenience proved a great time-saver. The cafeteria’s contribution toward a successful convention can be appreciated only by seeing it firsthand.</p>

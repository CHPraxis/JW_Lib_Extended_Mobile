<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">All persons who have faith in the kingdom of God and the blessings it will bring are commanded not to forsake the gathering of themselves together, but to continue encouraging one another to steadfastness in the public declaration of their hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23-25</a>) July will witness a great demonstration of devotion of Jehovah’s servants in the world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium, New York, July 19 to 26. Unquestionably, it will be one of the largest Christian assemblies of modern times. Every person interested in the progress of the New World society will have his attention fixed upon this assembly. Nevertheless, all publishers of good news will contribute toward the advance of true worship during July by everywhere presenting an offer of three bound books, on a contribution of $1.50, with three booklets free. Any books of your choice may be presented.</p>

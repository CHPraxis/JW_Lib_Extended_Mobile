Spiritual Blessings at International Assemblies
ASSEMBLIES of Jehovah’s people have always been occasions for spiritual feasting. The nation of Israel was commanded to assemble at Jerusalem several times a year for this very purpose. There they would hear Jehovah’s law read to them; also Jehovah’s righteous acts were rehearsed, how he delivered his people, protected and blessed them. The people were enriched by discourses, demonstrations and the singing of psalms.
Today, we still feast spiritually at assemblies. As in the past the righteous acts of Jehovah are rehearsed. People of good will learn that he is a tender God, long-suffering and affectionate. New light and thoughts are presented, and a more appreciative and broader understanding of Jehovah’s organization in action is received. At Yankee Stadium in 1950 we received a better understanding of the princes that are to rule in justice, our Kingdom songs received a new-world touch, our understanding of the Word of God was enriched with new aids to Bible study. Here, too, the foolishness of the evolution doctrine was unmasked as an “absurd, false, fantastic, unscientific, senseless, silly theory of evolution!” Political communism was exposed as unchristian and a persecutor of Jehovah’s witnesses. And, too, legal battles and victories on many fronts and in many lands were rehearsed. Admonition, encouragement and strength were received by our association and friendship.
With the 1953 assembly so near, what can we expect during our week of spiritual feasting? One thing we cannot expect, and that is disappointment! Rather, we can expect a feast of fat things, a thrilling review of Jehovah’s acts and promises, encouraging discourses from tried and faithful servants, experiences from many lands, on-the-scenes reports of court cases, victories, and joyous singing. The association, admonition, edification and inspiration of the occasion will strengthen us for future service. THIS WE CAN EXPECT!

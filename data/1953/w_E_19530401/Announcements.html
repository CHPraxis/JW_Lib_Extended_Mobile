<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>MATURITY BY THE SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) That is why mature Christians press on beyond elementary doctrine. They follow the leadings of Jehovah’s spirit, “for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 2:10</a>, <em>NW</em>) They press on to mature works, too, based on their mature understanding and appreciation of the marvelous secrets contained in the Holy Scriptures. During the month of April you can help others press on to maturity by telling them the truth about God’s Word and its importance to all men in these difficult times. Present them with the opportunity to subscribe for <em>The Watchtower, </em>sent twice a month for a year, for only $1. Three booklets are given as a premium. Some may wish both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>48 issues during the coming year, for only $2. There can be no maturity without spiritual food that builds strength. <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>are invaluable aids to this end.</p>

<p><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">Quebec Judge Rebukes Catholic Kidnapers</span></p>
<p><span class="font39">T</span><span class="font30">IE world has heard of the disgraceful persecution of Christian ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Roman Catholic-controlled province of Quebec. One of the most outrageous incidents recounted in these pages was the kidnaping at Joliettp, Quebec, of two young women ministers who were driven to Montreal and abandoned by their abductors after an unsuccessful attempt to put the young ladies ih prison. Legal proceedings were started against the kidnapers, which resulted in their being roundly denounced by a French Catholic judge for their cowardly and outrageous attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At the time of the incident (see </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font30">April 8, 1950) the Watch Tower Society made a careful investigation of the matter and was able to identify some of the kidnapers. Request was made to the attorney general of Quebec, Duplessis, to have the criminals prosecuted, but he never even acknowledged the registered letter that was sent. Accordingly, civil actions for damages were started on behalf of the two ministers, Olive Lundell and Winnifred Parsons, as a means of bringing the criminals to book. If the attorney general refuses to enforce the law, which he is duty bound to do, Jehovah’s witnesses, as lawabiding citizens, do their best to help maintain order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The cases against the kidnapers came up recently before Mr. Justice Andre Demers of the Superior Court, who, with great fairness and demonstrating a just sense of outrage^ condemned the kidnapers to pay damages, and delivered a severe reprimand for their disgraceful, criminal acts. The damages assessed were $600, which is a. small amount judged by most standards; but in fairness to the judge it must be pointed out that damages in Quebec law are very small and the amount awarded is in keeping with the usual allowance in damage actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In rendering judgment Mr. Justice Demers reviewed the facts of the kidnaping, pointing out that the two lady ministers were pushed into a taxi against their will and taken from Joliette to Montreal where an effort was made to lodge them in prison. The taxi driver tried to pretend that he was only a poor man trying to earn a living and who had been hired to drive some people to Montreal. The judge quickly swept away this transparent falsehood, pointing out that “no one can, by pretending he is a taxi-driver, take part in a criminal offence and then defend himself on the ground: T was only earning my living/ When a crime is committed and one helps those who are in course of committing it, one is an accomplice and equally guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">“The court has been greatly &lt;&nbsp;scandalized by the illegal and criminal conduct of this group of individuals who deprived two defenceless young women of that which they hold most dear: the right of each individual to personal liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">&quot;It is regrettable that in this affair the organizer or organizers were not brought before the courts to receive their just punishment. The three defendants in the present case are only pale nonentities. It is perhaps important to remark that there cannot be found in the jurisprudence of this province any case the same as this. This land </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font30"> America has always </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">been a </span><span class="font30">land of liberty. Our ancestors did not fear to brave a perilous sea, rigorous winters and dangerous enemies to establish themselves here. It would be regrettable if after three hundred years of freedom it would be in danger of being destroyed by the very sons of those pioneers who cleared and settled our great country and who even spilled their blood to improve it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">“We are bound to remark to the defendants and to all who participated in this criminal offence and who were not parties to this case that they made themselves liable to criminal prosecutions of great seriousness. It would be good for them to read section 297 of the Criminal Code which provides imprisonment up to twenty-five years for kidnaping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">“The plaintiff has a right to damages for insults and outrages which she has suffered, for the deprivation of her liberty and the assault of which she was the victim?' In addition to damages the court also issued an injunction “enjoining the defendants from interfering with the free exercise of the lawful activities of the plaintiff in the City of Joliette; the whole with costs’*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While the damages were not much, by the time the criminals pay the court costs, the damages and theib own lawyers, the whole affair will have proved quite educational to them. Little did they think as they arrogantly carried out the scheme of the priest who organized this outrage that they would be brought to book for their cowardly actions. The decision has also served to vindicate the lawful Christian work of Jehovah’s witnesses and to demonstrate that honest Catholics, with a sense of justice such as Mr. Justice Demers’, are disgusted with the actions of their compatriots who would stoop so low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Through proceedings of this kind other </span><span class="font30">people have recognized what a beneficial effect the fight of Jehovah’s witnesses is having on maintaining law and order as well as keeping open the door of liberty of speech, press and worship. The Edmonton </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font30"> remarked under the heading “Intolerance Condemned’’: “This judgment should do much to renew the safeguards of religious freedom and prevent renewal of persecution against the witnesses or anyone else. Realization that the law protects the rights of even the smallest and most unpopular sects and that interference with them may bring damages and perhaps even a prison term should exercise a restraining influence on the intolerant and the violent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the righteous decisions of liberty-loving men who recognize the justice of their demands for freedom to preach the truth. Primarily, however, they are grateful to Jehovah, their God, who has given them his Word and who has promised them protection and who, in fact, is protecting his faithful name-people against the most powerful and unprincipled attacks. “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.”—Isaiah 51:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font39">H</span><span class="font30">YPNOTISM is becoming ever more prevalent, especially in the United States. It is being used more and more for entertainment purposes by professional stage artists and neighborhood amateurs; it is being used more and more by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts in treating patients who have mental, emotional or conduct problems; more and more obstetricians and dentists are using it as an anesthetic; and more and more educators are using it to help backward students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What is this hypnotic phenomenon? How can its incredible things be accounted for? Is there any danger or risk involved in being hypnotized? Is it a form of demonism or associated with the magical arts? What are the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While hypnotic phenomena have from earliest times been a tool of the practitioners of false religion, and particularly pagan religion, having come down to us through the ancient Egyptian and Chinese priests, the Persian magi, the Indian yogis and fakirs, and while it is often associated with mental telepathy and with clairvoyance, yet it does seem possible to draw a fine line of distinction between hypnotism and spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A thing can be demonic without being a direct manifestation of evil spirits or demon power. For the most part it would seem that the words of James 3:15 </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(New World Trans.)</span><span class="font30"> could be applied to it: “This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is the earthly, animal, demonic.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While hypnotism In one form or another was practiced by the ancients, it was not until the latter part of</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">the eighteenth century that the Western world became interested in it due to the activities of one Mesmer, a physician who, expelled from Vienna because of his theories, practiced in Paris. He was very successful in treating diseases by making passes over the body, which, he claimed, caused “animal magnetism** to pass from him to the patient. His method came to be known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mesmerism.</span><span class="font30"> In spite of his success, or because of it, the board of the French Academy of Medicine, on which at the time happened to sit the American Benjamin Franklin, investigated him and denounced him as a fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Mesmerism did not die with Mesmer but was developed by others. In the 1840*s Braid, an English physician, discarding the theory of animal magnetism, named the various effects that the mesmerists were able to obtain at that time hypnotism, from the Greek word </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">hyprtos,</span><span class="font30"> meaning &quot;sleep”. The use of hypnotism spread throughout Europe, Nancy, France, becoming the fountainhead of hypnotic therapy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Natural Somnambulism</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">That hypnotic phenomena are not necessarily in themselves a manifestation of spiritism becomes apparent when we note how similar its deepest phase (there being four or five phases or stages) is to natural somnambulism or sleepwalking and sleep talking. Says the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana. </span><span class="font30">&quot;The somnambulist has been known to walk from one part of the house to another, to climb steep roofs or walk along ridges, to solve intricate mathematical problems, to write letters or work upon pictures, to attempt murder or suicide, etc.” Whatever the cause, mental, emotional or physical, it is held to be related to hysteria and epilepsy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Obviously we have another mind besides the waking or conscious mind, for the sleep walker remembers nothing. His ears deaf to ordinary sounds, his eyes blind though wide open, yet there is 'a direction of voluntary movements in most trying </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">circumstances</span><span class="font30"> that is marvelous'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While there is much doubt as to what actually takes place, as well as many conflicting theories, it seems reasonable to conclude that in hypnosis the conscious or objective mind is caused to recede and the subconscious, subjective or the &quot;unconscious” mind (as one authority terms it) is brought to the fore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Inducing Artificial Somnambulism</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Hypnotism has been defined as &quot;a state of exaggerated suggestibility induced by artificial means”. Various methods are used to induce this state. The stage artist employs a number of tricks either to overwhelm his subjects or throw them off guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Those whose purpose in using hypnosis is therapeutic scruple at such methods, well knowing the harm that may be done by them. For them it is not a matter of who has the stronger will but merely that of the subject’s being willing to co-operate with the operator. Their key is complete relaxation, which is brought about by monotonous sleep talk spoken in a low, slow yet firm tone of voice. Gradually the subject finds himself having a “faraway” feeling, a sense of numbness in his limbs, and a peculiar lethargy or spirit of laziness comes over him. Another popular method is that of asking the subject to fall backward- There are many other methods, all of which seem to be alike effective.—</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Hypnotism^</span><span class="font30"> Estabrooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">After about five minutes of sleep talk the subject may find that when dared to open his eyes he is unable to do so. Some more such talk and he may find himself unable to lift his hands or raise his feet; still more such talk and he may be unable to rise from his chair. The inability to go contrary to the will of the operator is thus </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gradually spread and tested from the little </span><span class="font30">muscles to the large ones. Told to rotate his hands, he finds himself doing so and unable to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A subject who has not been able to assert himself, or has had no inclination to do so (had he at any stage been able to resist he would have awakened and ended the hypnotic trance), usually can be brought into the deep trance state, and which state is marked by hallucination and amnesia. In this state he can be made to do almost anything, depending upon the skill of the operator, and of which he almost invariably remembers nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">His </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">five senses</span><span class="font30"> wiJJ note what the operator tells him tq note and will ignore that which he is told to ignore. Open a bottle of ammonia and tell him it has a lovely odor and he will sniff at it with delight; on the other hand, give him a bottle of the rarest perfume and tell him it stinks and he will turn from it in disgust. Tell him that wine is kerosene and ft will make him sick to the stomach to drink it; tell him water is champagne and he will actually become drunk from drinking water. Tell a music lover he is hearing a concert and he will describe the music he hears; make the most terrifying sounds and assure him all is quiet and he will not hear a sound. Tell a subject he feels nothing and he will ignore a strong electrical charge; touch him with a pencil and tell him it is a red-hot poker and he will scream with pain and may even show a red mark or blister. Yes, in trance not only the voluntary nervous system is subject to suggestion but also the involuntary or sympathetic nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While a person m deep trance can be made to hunt pink elephants with a broom or fish for whales, he cannot be made to go against deep-seated convictions; that is, not directly, A teetotaler will refuse to drink whisky. A socialist told to preach on the merits of capitalism will preach on the merits of socialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Another effect obtained by hypnosis is catalepsy, a term used to describe a disease that causes a waxy rigidity of the limbs so that they can be placed in various positions dnd so remain for a time. In catalepsy a subject's body can be made so rigid that his head can be placed on one chair and his feet on another and his abdomen will support the weight of a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">How is this possible? In treating the form of insanity known as dementia praecox, doctors have used a drug, metra-zol, to induce convulsions, which are so violent that in 25 per cent of the cases they break some of the bones in the spinal column. Obviously, if by metrazol the sympathetic nervous system can make the muscles stronger than bones then it should not seem impossible that hypnotism can do the same, since the sympathetic nervous system is so responsive to hypnotic suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Further, in deep trance illusions can be foisted on the subject. Tell him he is a dog and he will walk on all fours and bark; tell him he is a politician and he will orate; tell him he is a five-year-old and he will not only act but also answer questions exactly as a five-year-old would, a fact borne out by intelligence tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">When a person is deeply hypnotized he is in touch or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rapport</span><span class="font30"> only with the operator who brought him into that state. He heeds no other. However, the operator can transfer the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rapport</span><span class="font30"> to another person merely by telling the subject that he will do so. Whether or not the subject actually does not hear others or merely ignores them may be open to question, authorities claiming that it is a matter of choice. However, the press recently told of a young woman about to bear a child, who when put into the trance state heard only what the operator told her, Ignoring entirely the words of the nurses as well as those of her husband. It would hardly seem that under such circumstances a woman would ignore the voice of her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“Suggestibility”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While it is claimed that sex has nothing to do with suggestibility, yet the facts seem to indicate that girls and young women are more likely to respond than boys and young men. Neurotic, imaginative^ hysterical and introverted persons, as well as sleepwalkers and sleep talkers are quite suggestible. Stubborn or bullheaded persons usually are more difficult, and it is practically impossible to hypnotize children under five, imbeciles and insane persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Ninety per cent can be brought into the first stage of trance, at least after a number of tries, but only 20 per cent, regardless of the skill of the operator or the method used, can be brought into deep trance. Why nobody seems to know. The explanation is that this is because of certain personality traits that are unknown and cannot be influenced. This would lend added weight to the position that hypnotism is not necessarily a manifestation of spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Mass hypnotism is also possible. Not just the kind Hitler used, although such use of oratory is closely related to and involves the principles of hypnotism, but also the hypnotizing of groups of persons into various stages of the trance. Thus America’s foremost stage hypnotist, Polgai, at the Texas Woman’s College in 1944, hypnotized 153 persons out of an audience of 160, an amazingly high average. He often hypnotizes 200 persons at a time and claims that in some 20 years he has hypnotized a million persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A skillful hypnotist can hypnotize many subjects while they are sound asleep and even waking persons who are opposed to being hypnotized, although this requires a disguised technique. By ostensibly taking one’s blood pressure the operator could cause the reluctant one to relax and by subtly talking sleep without any reference to hypnotism such a one could be brought Into the trance state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The use of phonograph recordings for Inducing the hypnotic state has become quite popular. For such purpose often a special recording is made for a certain subject, although in one instance the playing of a Swiss yodeling recording, which was represented as a hypnotic record to a group, caused one of the listeners to go into hypnotic trance, He expected to be </span><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">hypnotized, happened to be a good subject, and his imagination did the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Doctors use such drugs as ethyl chloride, nembutal </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font30"> sodium amytal on patients who seem to be especially difficult to hypnotize. It is necessary to use such drugs only once; after that they readily go into trance by the usual methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Hypnotic power, in spite of its popular appeal, is not being used on radio and TV. Why not? Because it might be too successful’ How many accidents would </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font30"> caused by car drivers’ falling asleep? How many fires by those smoking tobacco and falling asleep? And what about those who failed to wake up? Or went into hysterics? Who would be on hand to wake these up or to attend to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In view of the foregoing it must be apparent to all, and it is admitted by authorities on the subject, that in the hands of the unskilled or amateur, the careless or unscrupulous, the power of hypnotism can represent a real menace. For further information we refer the reader to subsequent articles on even more amazing aspects of hypnotism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Here, without need for further comment, J we cite from the column “It Happened Last [ Night&quot; by Earl Wilson In the September 25, ! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1952,</span><span class="font4"> New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Post: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Somebody's got to blow the whistle on the | breakdown of American decency.

<p><span class="font4">Two more months slid by but the subject &lt;&nbsp;was not dead. He said on December 3: “My Broadway column is just having its 10th birthday. It was born at the start of World War </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">II—</span><span class="font4">a right bawdy era. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">But the Forties </span><span class="font4">were Epworth Leagueish beside the Feelthy Fifties. ...

Of course, my own Beautiful Wife tells me I'm daffy about the whole thing. 'There's no more sin than ever—Just more columnists and commentators screaming about it,’ says she. 1 disagree. Anyway, in an earlier decade, these facts would have shocked people more. . . . And the decade is still young.

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This Is the New World Station</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font38" style="font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font33" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enerally </span><span class="font30">thought to be merely an entertainment medium, radio can be much more. It can exert a tremendous influence an the lives of its listeners, either for good or for ill. It can shock into action or lull to sleep, stir hatred or build faith, flash a warning or bring a message of peace* In short, it is a great potential for enlightenment if used in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">With the advent of television, many predicted the decease of radio within a short time. It is now readily acknowledged by those who have studied the matter that radio is here to stay. There are 105 million radio sets in American homes today and the public is buying more new radios than ever before. Figures show that more people listen to the radio now than before TV hit the market*</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Despite its great potential, it must be admitted that radio is not being used to its full effectiveness as a beneficial medium. In countries like Great Britain, where radio stations are government-owned and operated, there is no competition and as a result advances in broadcasting techniques are slow and there is little variety in programs. On the other hand, Ln the United States, where stations are operated primarily by commercial concerns, who sell time to advertisers, there is overcommercialization. One commercial announcement after another drives the listener to mentally tune off the commercial or completely turn off the radio* It can readily be said that commercial jingles greatly jangle the listeners’ nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">More than that, commercial stations are afraid to speak out boldly on any subject for fear of offending a potential advertiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Newspapers may express their frank views on the eolto rial page, but broadcasters, never. When a controversial program is carried over a station, the announcer invariably makes a nan-committal announcement stating; “These views do not necessarily express the opinion of this station?’ After all, their object for being in business Is to gain and retain sponsors. No sponsors, no Income. It is as simple as that. Listen critically to commercial broadcasts and see how much talking is done but how little Is said that is truly beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The primary programs that attract listeners are those that entertain. Top-quality entertainment is not too plentiful. As a result much is broadcast that is meaningless, pointless, not overly entertaining, but very time-taking. Musical programs present an overdone sufficiency of jazzy or hillbilly selections with an emphasis on songs glorifying passionate love. Music is one of radio’s most enjoyable features, but much of it is not very listenable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Many religious programs present the emotional haranguing by some overwrought clergyman whose programs remind one of the crying of a currently popular American singer. Human philosophy and psychology ate preached by the ream of script, but simple Bible instruction is rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Station WBBR Is Different</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There is, however, cne station that does not fit into the above description. That station is WBBR, Brooklyn, New York, Being noncommercial, it does not have to cringt Ln fear of sponsors. Its object is, not to gain popular appeal, but to inform those of good wiU concerning God’s new world. WBBR says something and does not apologize for it. The most-skilled comedian on a commercial station cannot make today's bad news good. However, WBBR brings to its listeners the heart-cheering message of God's new world, his kingdom which is now so near at hand. Such programs in* still hope, faith and love in the hearts of those who sigh and cry because of the turmoil In the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">We are sure you will agree that it is pleasant to have friends drop in to visits especially when they are good friends who show true Christian love and friendship. WBBR is a real friend to its many listeners because it is interested in them and does them the greatest good by bringing to them knowledge that will lead to everlasting life in the new world. (John 17:3, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font30"> Such good news is upbuilding to all members of the family. It is no wonder that WBBR is invited into so many homes as a welcome guest,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Early in 1952 a poll was taken within the listening range of WBBR and it was found that 14 per cent of the 164,562 persons contacted had listened to the Watchtower programs. This means that, of the 15£ million potential listeners in the area it serves, 2,170,000 persons have heard the station. Of this number, many “hear, and say, It is truth”.—Isaiah 43:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Programs on WBBR</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">WBBR programs appeal to many listeners. Fine recorded music, generally in the light concert class, neither jazzy nor “long hair”, brings enjoyment to lovers of good music The Watchtower Concert organ, located in the largest of the three studios, brings delightful music Into the living rooms of many. Also a favorite is the singing of the WBBR Watchtower Male Chorus, a group of 20 voices raised in songs of praise to Jehovah. WBBR’s newsroom gathers reports erf world events from the wires of International News Service and presents them on the program “Watching the World”. General public service presentations, such as '&quot;Through Feminine Eyes”, “Farm and Food News” and ‘&quot;Safety Items”, bring listeners information on homemaking, gardening, safety, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Licensed as an educational station, WBBR fulfills its purpose by presenting many educational programs. These, however, are not a dry, tasteless presentation in formal, stilted manner, but pleasingly informal, interesting, practical, up to date, and wide in scope. Here is a schedule of some of the feature programs:</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Variety in material and style of presentation makes the programs listenable and instructive. A Scripture text for each day is read and discussed on “Thoughts for the Day”. “The Sunday Morning Forum” is a round-table discussion of topics of current interest by persons representing the scientific, Catholic and other viewpoints. Youthful ministers from all parts of the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">States are invited to be guests on the program &quot;A Young Minister Speaks&quot;. Each weekday morning listeners enjoy hearing Bob and Mary, a young married couple, whose conversations &quot;At the Breakfast Table” have made theirs a favorite program with many. Seven o’clock in the evening means it is &quot;Home Bible Study Time”, when listeners are invited to drop in on a family group as they discuss God’s Word. The character portrayals make the study live as questions and arguments are raised and answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">To give ah adequate description of the programs is impossible. To appreciate them, they must be heard. If you ever have the opportunity to hear WBBR, be certain to do so. Then you will know for yourself that there is no station like WBBR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As an illustration of how listeners enjoy hearing the New World station, here is part of a letter received from a New Jersey listener:</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">&quot;We would like to add our voice to the many thousands of those of your listeners and express our congratulations to you for a fine, well-rounded-out program. Its variety and natural informality in the presentation of information makes it easy to say, You have hit a new high in New World broadcasting! Its variety keeps any listener from tiring and its informality allows the mind to relax and open itself to the ideas presented.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A steady flow of mail is received from listeners expressing their appreciation. A very large percentage of these request Bible literature, which is offered free to listeners, and many send in Bible questions that they want answered. Thus WBBR is doing much good and Is aiding many on the road to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The script from one WBBR program, &quot;Things People Are Thinking About,” is mimeographed and distributed to ministers throughout the United States and other countries. At the present time it is being presented on approximately 90 radio stations in various parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Special Test Broadcast</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">On January 25, this year, WBBR broadcast a special test program for the purpose of learning how far it could be heard. Congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in eastern and central parts of the United States and Canada were informed in advance of the broadcast from 4:15 to 6:00 a.m. (E.S.T.), those hours being selected so that other stations would generally be off the air and would not interfere with WBBR’s signal. Those hearing the broadcast were asked to notify WBBR. The results were very gratifying. A total of 817 letters were received. The Watchtower station had been heard in 25 states in the United States and throughout a large area of Canada. Many expressed their delight at being able to hear the Kingdom message over their radios.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">WBBR is a powerful voice for bringing the good news of the Kingdom into the homes of thousands. The New World station is accomplishing its educational purpose, because, as a result of its broadcasts, many have come to a knowledge of God’s Word, have dedicated their lives to do God’s will and now, together with WBBR, are raising their voices in praise to Jehovah.</span></p>

It has the greatest frequency of sailings of any port In the world, Is a terminal for twelve railroads, forty bus lines, a hub </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> the highway spokes of the East, and a major world aviation center. And though it is at the eastern edge of the country, one out of every ten people in the United States Ilves within 50 miles of New York—as many people as live in all of Canada!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">C. First in this land of Fords and Chryslers are the city's tunnels, bridges and highways. The George Washington bridge crosses the Hudson from New Jersey with a 3J500-foot span, the world’s second-longest. The Lincoln tunnel en* lets the midtown area near Times Square. To the south the Holland tunnel, a 9^277-foot tube opened in 1927, is now used by 15 million cars a year. Pointing toward the city from greater distances are Connecticut's Merritt parkway, the New Jersey turnpike and the more-distant Pennsylvania turnpike. These whiz their riders great distances without even so much as signal lights or cross traffic, with so few obstacles to rapid travel that their speed laws must be rigidly enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">C The finest of airports are located around the edges of the city. Newark on the southwest and LaGuardia on the east have recently been supplemented by the monstrous five-mlle-iong, iwoand-a-half-mile-wide New York International airport where, 15 miles from mld-Manhattan, most overseas flights land. At peak capacity it will handle 1,000 flights daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">€, Bus travel received an added impetus In 1950 when the new $24-million Port Authority bus terminal, the world’s largest, was opened a block from Times Square in mld-Manhattan. It is 800 feet long, 200 feet wide, and consists of four levels plus a basement, a mezzanine and a three-acre roof parking lot. Buses enter directly from the Lincoln tunnel, totally ignorIng </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">city</span><span class="font4"> traffic. 77ie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">terminal can </span><span class="font4">accommodate 2^500 such buses and well over 100,000 travelers dally, C Trains come Into either Grand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Central station, Pennsylvania station or one of several other stations of railroads that end on the New Jersey side of the Hudson and ferry their passengers across the river. Grand Central handles about 550 trains a day, all of which must enter the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">station through a long four-track-wide </span><span class="font4">tunnel. No other great railroad station in the world has so few approaching main tracks, and during rush hours trains are only twenty seconds apart! Pennsylvania station has more than five miles of tunnels. Two go under the Hudson, four under the East river to connect with Long Island. Its waiting room Is 150 feet high—the equivalent of a 15-story building!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;£ All these facilities, phis direct express trains and planes, often make this city easier to get to than others that may be nearer by. This month these will be put to good use by Jehovah's witnesses converging on New York from the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Great transports will land at New York International airport; monarchs of the sea will dock a mile from Times Square; special trains win flash down shining rails along the Hudson and Into the two-and-a-half-mlle tunnel under the glitter of Park Avenue to Grand Central station, while others roar through Hudson River tunnels into New York, Great buses will unload at the new ter mlnal and the private Greyhound stations, and autoists will come over turnpikes, elevated roadways, tunnels and great bridges. All will have one purpose in mind. They are coming to New York, not for its tourist attractions, but for the eight days of July 19-26, when Yankee Stadium will be a center of Bible education and theocratic training, where the foundation will be laid for future expansion of gospel-preaching. They are not getting to New York without difficulty, but their efforts will be well rewarded. Can you appreciate that fact? Only if you come to such an assembly and experience it for yourself, You are invited.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">HEN boys of ancient Rome flipped coins, the exclamation was “heads or ships”. It has not changed very much in almost two thousand years. Today it is ‘heads or tails”. But whichever side comes up, one thing is certain: the history of coins is a continuous picture gallery of rulers and gods with pagan religion predominantly influencing designs and inscriptions.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Who was the first man to be commemorated on coins? Perhaps one of the earliest of men to be honored in such a manner was Nimrod, the first man to be made a god after the Flood. The Greeks had a fabulous creature, which played an important part in Greek mythology, called the centaur, half man, half horse. That imaginary creation, as is generally admitted, was intended to commemorate the man who first taught the art of horsemanship. On this point Hislop's </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons</span><span class="font30"> states: “Who so likely to get the credit of producing the horse as the great huntsman of Babel, who no doubt enlisted it in the toils of the chase.” Then Mr. Hislop reveals a startling fact: “But that creation [the centaur] was not the offspring of Greek fancy. Here, as in many other things, the Greeks have only borrowed from an earlier source. The centaur is found on coins struck in Babylonia showing that the idea must have originally come from that quarter,” Who then would most likely be represented by this early Babylonian coin but Babylon’s founder, Nimrod, the arrogant “mighty hunter before the Lord”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In ancient Greece each city-state placed the figure of its patron deity on its money. Probably they served as a kind of celestial police guard against clipping and counterfeiting, for only the most sacrflegicua rogue would think of harming them. In course of time there was established between coins and religion an association so intimate that, before the middle of the fourth century B.C., it had come to be looked on almost as a matter of course that the types of coins should be religious in subject.—</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution of Coins,</span><span class="font30"> bv Georce MacDonald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Portraits on Coins</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">To picture a living man upon coins was a sacrilege to the Greek way of thinking. Nonetheless, by 350 B.C, there were already signs of the near approach of a day when mortal men would be accorded seats in Olympus, the chief abode of the gods, even in their lifetime. Indeed, some forty years before this the Thasians had offered to make a god of the stout old Spartan king Agesilaus, only to be contemptuously told that, if they wanted him to consider the proposal, they had better begin by making gods of themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Until the dose of the fourth century B.C. portraits on coins were practically unknown. It had long been, though, a</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">sacrifice to de*</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Grecian custom to offer parted heroes. The result time of Alexander the Great’s accession, it had become a well* established convention that a coin should have on its obverse or front side the head of a divinity, After the death of Alexander the Great, </span><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">he became first a here and then a god, and </span><span class="font30">his portrait was placed on coms. He thus became the first historical personage whose portrait on coins can be recognized with absolute certainty.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Though Alexander the Great was not officially deified during his lifetime, it is obvious that from the deification of a monarch just dead to the deification of his living successor is little more than a step. Ptolemy was among the earliest to be hailed as a god. But it was not until the next generation that the worship of the reigning monarch was formally established as the state religion. Then it became the custom for living monarchs to be deified, and gradually their portraits came to mark the coinage of their reigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Roman Portraits</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The coins of Rome at their very outset were specifically religious in character. The reverse side was occupied by a prow of a ship, symbol of the vaunted sea power of the Roman Republic. But the obverse was reserved for the head of the divinity: Janus, Jupiter, Hercules, Mercury, etc. Hence, on the Roman playgrounds, boys tossed “heads or ships’*. The strength of the hold that pagan religion had gained over coins was clearly manifested in 268 B.C., when silver coins began to be issued. The obverse of the earliest denarii bore the head of Roma, while on the reverse, riding as if to battle, were Castor and Pollux, the patron divinities of the knights. Roma gradually lost her monopoly of the obverse and gave way to the heads of other gods. Great Romans of the past occasionally appeared, but not until the days of Julius Caesar was the head of a living Roman placed upon coins struck within the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There is a very interesting denarius that vividly brings home the inflated pride that the murderers of Julius Caesar took in their achievement On the obverse is</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">Brutus' own portrait with his name. The </span><span class="font30">reverse shows the cap of liberty, flanked by two daggers. As if to obviate all risk of misunderstanding, “The Ides of March” is added beneath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From the time of Augustus forward, until the fall of the Roman empire, the normal obverse type is the head or bust of the reigning emperor. Some rulers boasted of divinity; others did not particularly dwell on the subject. History says that Alexander the Great’s acceptance of divine honors was only half serious. Some emperors even talked facetiously about their divinity. On his deathbed, Emperor Vespasian pulled out a coin and remarked to his son Titus: *Tm turning into a god, I take.it.” *</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Camouflaging the Pagan Element</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">During the reign of Constantine the Great, many so-called Christian symbols were blended with the pagan and put on coins. Thus A.D, 326, the year after the Council of Nicaea, there was struck a piece having the head of Constantine and the reverse side bearing the standard of the cross. Does this mean coins went Christian? No, for the cross itself is of pagan origin! (See </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font30"> October 8, 1951.) </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">The New Funk and Wagnails Encyclopedia </span><span class="font30">says under “Constantine I’<sup>1</sup>: “He retained the traditional pa^an title of Pontifex Maximus, . . . and his coins still bear the figures and the names of the old gods?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">During the reign of Julian the Apostate, the so-called Christian coins disappeared and paganism’s undisguised head was emblazoned on coins in the form of Egyptian deities. But Justinian n went back to striking coins with a bust of Christ surrounded by the words: “King of Kings.” The bust of Christ is not found upon coins again until the day of the iconoclastic emperors was over. These emperors reverted to the pagan cross for their “tails” side. However, A J&gt;. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">842</span><span class="font30"> the bust of Christ was re-storeu almost at once. Only now Christ is given a different pose: “he is shown placing the crown on the head of the emperor,” thus conveying the illusion to everyone that the emperor rules by divine right. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">—Evolution of Coins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By and by the virgin appeared on coins, sometimes with hands outstretched in prayer, sometimes with a “holy child” seated upon her knee. The earliest coin on which the virgin appears with the child is a silver piece of John I (969-976), which bears the descriptive title &quot;Mother of God”. The reverse is entirely occupied by the following inscription: “Mother of God, most glorious, he who putteth his confidence in Thee never cometh to naught.” This title, however, is not given by the Bible to Mary, and in regard to the pagan origin of such mother worship </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons</span><span class="font30"> states: “The Babylonians, in their popular religion, supremely worshipped a Goddess Mother and a Son, who was represented in pictures and in images as an infant or child in his mother’s arms. From Babylon, this worship of the Mother and the Child spread to the ends of the earth. . . . Under the name of the ‘Mother of the gods/ the goddess queen of Babylon became an object of almost universal worship. ‘The Mother of the gods/ says Cleri-cus, ‘was worshipped by the Persians, the Syrians, and all the kings of Europe and Asia, with the most profound religious veneration/ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Pagan Pattern Persists</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Coins of France during the reigns of the Carolingian kings frequently pictured a temple, supposed somehow to symbolize Christianity. During the Middle Ages, the patron saint usually took the place of the local divinity; however, the underlying pagan principle was still there. And at the time of the Sixth Crusade, a papal legate accompanied Louis IX and was horrified to find “Christians” of Acre and Tripoli minting coins bearing the name of Mohammed and dated according to the Mohammedan era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The coins, then, from Constantine on, have they followed a Christian or a pagan pattern? Explains the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font30"> (under “Numismatics”): “From Constantine, the pagan element in the coinage declined. Little of Christianity, however, took its place.” But apparently the pagan element never declined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Regarding the popular practice of placing portraits of reigning sovereigns on coins, the book </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution of Coinage</span><span class="font30"> explains: “It will be clear that this was, in its essence, a legacy from the Hellenistic age, through the medium of the Roman empire.” When the very first coin act passed the United States Senate, it provided that the head of the president should appear on all coins. Indeed, a number of pattern pieces were struck, showing President Washington in various types of dress from that of a Roman emperor in toga and laurel crown down to his own uniform and wig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Congress later, however, concurred in deciding that the likeness of a president on the coins savored too much like pagan Rome and other monarchies, and that an emblem of liberty would be more suitable for a republic. Hence, goddesses of liberty in various forms appeared on United States coins. However, in modern times the goddess of liberty has been gradually discarded and presidents have been appearing on regular-issue coins. Thus Presidents Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Washington appear on the one-, five-, ten-, and twenty-five-cent pieces respectively. A few years ago Lady Liberty was removed from the fifty-cent piece and replaced with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin; hence all coins minted by the United States government today bear the likeness of some famous person. Unde Sam has wound up with a p</span><span class="font30" style="text-decoration:underline;">agan</span><span class="font30"> pattern that Congress originally decided against!</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Can we say, then, that the pattern in coins has changed much since the days of Babylonish coins commemorating Nimrod, since the days of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar? In answer, note the words of one of the foremost authorities on the evolution of coins, George MacDonald, who stated: “So therefore, as types are concerned, the coinage of. Greece had reached a stage of development beyond which the world has scarcely advanced today.” Whether it has “advanced” any, you be the judge!</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Coins have thus served well to perpetuate and glorify the names of men, for after portraits and even triumphal arches have crumbled, coins are the only record that survives. Even the motto on United States coins “In God We Trust” was suggested by a clergyman with the sole purpose of recording for posterity the fact that this was a Christian nation. But Is It Christian today with its divided religions, its racial prejudice; its immorality, its trust in H-bombs? George Washington made the legendary cherry tree popular, but the plums more common in politics now are jingling coins! In view of this, perhaps the famous slogan could well be amended to read, “In This God We Trust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">True Christians today do not put their trust in the dollar, pound, franc, peso or any other form of money. They know that it can be valueless overnight. Such a day is close at hand. (James 5:1-3) Soon Armageddon’s battle will wipe out this paganized world, along with all its false gods. True Christians serving Jehovah, the God who made heaven and earth, will survive into a new world of righteousness wherein love will supplant the insatiable greed for glory and money, and wherein there never will be a need to write another chapter on the subject: “Coins Tell a Pagan Story.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font36"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Pagan Foundations. Literally!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">When the Israelites moved into Canaan were they commanded to borrow prestige from that land's demon religion? No! Listen: ‘Destroy their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves [sacred poles], and bum their graven things. Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema, like it. Thou shalt detest It as dung: and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because It Is an anathema.”—Deuteronomy 7:5, 26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Has the so-called “Christian religion” of today followed that instruction? No! When British professor Ernest A. Rudge of West Ham Municipal College discovered 130 strange stones marking an ancient cross-country trail, he noted that many had been built into the foundations of old Saxon churches. Something mystical was involved, for the stones were shunned after dark, and one legend said that three times the builders of a church brought one down from a hill and the Devil carried it back. Finally they built the church on the hill and the stone stayed. Said </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Time:</span><span class="font4"> ''Inspired by these tales Dr. and Mrs. Rudge dug into church history. They found that Pope Gregory the Great, in a letter to his missionaries in 601 A.D., told them not to destroy such stones when they found them in pagan Britain. Instead, he said, they should build their churches upon them, so that the centers of new Christianity might enjoy the prestige of a more ancient faith.” Rather than detesting them as dung, he wanted them warmly embraced, but the persistence of the early pagan reverence for them is tangible evidence that God knew more about maintaining pure worship than did Gregory!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">tons. And there are innumerable forms that have no shells.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The growth of the plankton is fierce in intensity and astronomically great in numbers. Vast areas of ocean are covered with a living blanket of cells. Mile after mile</span></p>
<p><span class="font39">T</span><span class="font30">ECHNICALLY speaking, no water is wholly free of living organisms. A glass of what might appear to be crystal-clear sea water is actually alive with myriads of microscopic and transparent living plant and animal organisms. What is more, these microscopic creatures are of rare and unsuspected beauty, “a beauty so totally dissimilar to that which distinguishes the larger and more familiar residents of our planet that there is really no standard of comparison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Furthermore, there is no known body of water where these living organisms do not occur. Huge quantities of microcrustaceans have been found to exist on ocean floors and an overabundance of algal creatures were located In polar regions and in pools of melting snow. Virtually all water, tropical or temperate, cold or warm, is rich in plants and animals, most of which are microscopic in size. To this teeming population Victor Hensen of Germany proposed a collective name—Plankton, which is from a Greek word, meaning &quot;wandering&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This massive population is made up of minute jellyfish, miniature shrimp, snails and worms, which provide the pasturelands for fish such as herring, sprat and mackerel. So rich and plentiful are these pastures that creatures like the Greenland whale, which often attains a length of fifty feet, feed solely upon them. Their abundance is just as great 600 feet down as at of water may appear red or brown or green, the whole surface taking on the color of the infinitesimal grains of pigment contained in each of the plant or animal cells. These are matched by other outbursts of microscopic plant life of the plankton. In the sea, as on land, spring is a time for the renewal of life. The surface waters become a vast nursery. The eggs and young of many of the bottom animals rise to the surface of the sea. The average egg production from each female creature in the plankton is probably about a million a year. Most of these are eaten before they ever grow up; this adds up to a tremendous food supply for such fishes as the mackerel and herring. The little acorn barnacles that grow on rocky coasts may produce &quot;as many as 20 tons of babies a year for each mile of shore”, and the barnacle is but one of the many animals that live there. One cod spawns several million eggs annually, which become part of the plankton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Plankton Discoveries</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Despite their quantity, scientists have found, too, that plankton hunting &quot;could involve them in just as much difficulty, hard work, and disappointment as hunting for bigger game&quot;. Professor H. B. Moore of the University of Miami stated that unlike birds or butterflies, whose parentage is clear or can be easily traced, matters in the sea are far less simple. &quot;To begin with,” said the professor, “most plankton animals .,. are extremely difficult to keep alive in captivity. Accustomed as they are to the cushioning of the ocean waters, they may conceivably bruise themselves fatally when they bump into the walls of an aquarium. Or perhaps we do not yet know the right food to give them, and they just starve. Many of them ., . have mouths so small that they could not swallow anything bigger than a few thousandths of an inch across. When you add to all this the fact that many of the most exciting animals come from deep, cold waters into which daylight never penetrates, where the pressures are tons to the square inch, you will see why so many of them are killed even before we can bring them to the surface in our nets. To keep them alive in the laboratory is a problem. It is understandable, then, why so few of the animals found in the plankton have been watched through their whole life cycle,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">However, recent scientific discoveries have turned up several unbelievable facts about the plankton. For one thing they nave found that planktonic globigerina ooze covers an area “of nearly 50,000,000 square miles” of ocean bed! That perhaps the loveliest of ail protozoans are the Radiolaria. Like living snowflakes their most exquisite shapes are a constant source of pleasure to the collector. Sea urchins and starfish are among the most colorful inhabitants of the sea. Urchins are round like pumpkins but striped like some watermelons. Scientists have found that when a baby starfish decides to leave home a stalk begins to grow out of the back of the adults body. On this a delicate bud sprouts, and from it emerges a tiny baby starfish. The fine stalk finally breaks off and the baby begins its downward plunge to the bottom of the seas, while the old body and arms swim away and in time die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Phronima has a few ingenious angles of her own. She takes over a discarded house of another plankton animal, a tunicate. This house, or tunic, is a trans* parent barrel made, surprisingly, of celiu* lose. Professor Moore states that &quot;the Phronima creeps into this ready-made plastic barrel, and, by paddling water through it with her legs, achieves very effective jet propulsion. At the same time the barrel makes a splendid nursery for the babies. They are as safe from attack as human babies behind the glass windows of a hospital ward; yet the streams of water pumped in by the mother bring them a steady supply of the minute food which they need&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Another amazing discovery Professor Moore and his colleagues made was that when the eggs of the Salpidae hatched and the young grew up they were &quot;different animals from their parents—so much so, in fact, that they originally were described as a different species. What is more, this second generation does not lay eggs. Instead, it grows a long chain of buds, which finally break off to grow up into the egglaying generation again. The situation is about the same as if a greyhound had puppies which turned out to be dachshunds, and these dachshunds grew extremely long tails which broke off and grew into greyhounds. Absurd as it sounds, this is what happens, and which are we to call the parent of which?”—</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geo* graphic Magazine,</span><span class="font30"> July, 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Phosphorescent Plankton</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Still another phenomenon that baffles scientists. The one-celled animals known to zoologists as the Dinoflagellates deserve mention. It is due chiefly to their presence that the sea becomes phosphorescent at night and, where the animals are in great number, assumes a deep tinge of brilliant red during the day. These minute animals</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">no larger than a speck in diameter are observed under the microscope as “selecting their food from the surrounding medium, revealing that they have their preferences, just as have higher animals whose bodies are composed of billions of cells”. William Crowder in his article on “Living Jewels of the Sea” goes on to say that “the color, the beauty, and the intensity of the light emitted by so small a creature have been subjects of considerable investigation, but the secrets are still unrevealed. It has been possible, of course, to isolate the chemical compounds causing this light, yet of their ultimate' nature practically nothing is known”. The tiny ostracode crustacean Cypridena emits light so powerful “that one .part of its luminous gland in about two billion parts of water will impart a visible glow to this medium”. If man “possessed an organ giving the same proportionate Volume and degree of illumination, he would be capable of lighting up the business area of a city like Washington, D.C.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geographic Magazine,</span><span class="font3"> September, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Noctiluca Lives Forever</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unique among the plankton and among the world of living things, Noctiluca is the only known animal that never dies, that is, from so-called natural causes, such as old age. Otherwise, it lives forever! Its coveted secret of perpetual life lies in its method of reproduction. Crowder explains this marvel this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At a certain stage in the life of the individual a division of its body takes place. A constriction is first formed in the cell wall around the middle of the sphere, this constriction rapidly growing deeper and finally separating the animal into distinct and equal parts. Each of these parts in turn becomes a smaller but exact duplicate of its single prototype. That is to say, what was originally one adult mother cell has resolved itself into twin daughters. When the twins grow older they likewise divide, and the cycle continues.... However, this method of reproduction by fission, as it is termed, does not go on indefinitely without variation; for in some succeeding generation two individuals will meet, a fusion of their cell substance will occur, and the pair will appear to coalesce into a single unit, thus apparently reversing the process of division. Sooner or later the fused cells develop prominences or- buds on the surface of the sphere. These ultimately become detached and swim away as zoospores, or young Noctilucas, who, when they grow up, will again carry on reproduction by division in the manner first described.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently, plankton have won fame for their remarkable stamina. A hollow transparent plastic wheel was filled with sea water through a sealable window and plankton were introduced. The wheel was turned so that with all their swimming the plankton always remained in the same place. In these experiments the scientists were the first to give up. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter,</span><span class="font3"> commenting on this experiment, said: “The scientists were exhausted but the tiny plankton, which had been swimming furiously all the time, were as fresh as at the start.... Calanus, a little shrimplike animal not quite the size of a grain of rice, can reach speeds of 100 yards an hour and keep going at 50 yards an hour for an hour at a time. Weight for weight, a man would have to run at hundreds of miles an hour to duplicate this performance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The seas are filled with praise to their mighty Creator who is worthy of it all. “Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.”—Romans 11:33, 36, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World- Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">By ‘'Awikel&quot; corrMpondent In Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4 THE deceased lady had been of good will ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">toward Almighty God* Her daughter is <sub>4 </sub>an active, witness of Jehovah. At the funeral * a young Japanese minister In an understand- $ able way showed from the Bible why men die, !</span><span class="font27">■</span><span class="font4"> the condition of and hope for the dead. He told how Jehovah God would bring many back , in a resurrection to live everlastingly on a paradise earth, This was their hope; it is sure, ' for God cannot lie. When the young minister t concluded, other members of the family re- •? quested the customary Buddhist rites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Buddhist priest, his face expressionless j and his head completely shaved, entered and, </span><span class="font27">।</span><span class="font4"> in the presence of all, his attendant helped <sub>4 </sub>him put on his elaborate officiating garments. <sup>1 </sup>Ceremoniously he approached the altar, which v was decorated with offerings of food and fruit as a gesture of friendship toward the soul. On bended knee he lit the candles to furnish &lt;&nbsp;light for the soul in the room. Then slowly he rose and rejoined his attendant priest in the center of the room. The attendant, with the » clanging of bells, summoned the soul to ap- 5 proach. Then the priest began to read from the Buddhist scriptures, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">O-kyo^</span><span class="font4"> In chant- $ Ing style and in words not understood by any- I one in the room, for the O-kyo is written in J a dead language—the Pali dialect of the Sanskrit Reading the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">O-kyo</span><span class="font4"> was in effect a peti- ,, tlon to the Buddhist god to guide the soul to ’ its heavenly home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the reading continued, the relatives, i one by one, in the order of nearest of kin, £ went to the altar, rosary in hand, knelt, cere- j moniously took incense and put it into a Are </span><span class="font27">।</span><span class="font4"> pot. Each did this twice, thus expressing hope , of everlasting life for the soul in the unseen * world. Then, with hands clasping the rosary, I each repeated the words, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Namu amida t butau”</span><span class="font4"> an invocation for the soul’s happiness, a The rosary has IOS beads that stand for the </span><span class="font27">।</span><span class="font4"> 108 sinful desires of man. When clasping the . rosary they supposedly are crushing these ! sinful desires, and thus the soul, void of these $ selfish desires, is fit to make its journey safely ? to heaven. His petition having been made for » the dead, the relative rises from the altir. J Before retiring to his seat he bows to the floor * before the priests to thank them for the part they had In giving the soul a good send-off on its journey to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gokuraJeu,</span><span class="font4"> the Japanese “heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During all this time the deceased person has been housed in a simple wooden box. No work of beauty, this wooden box. As is customary for rich and poor alike, it is rough and unfinished and held together by a few nails. At this time the nails were loosened, and the lid removed. One by one, the relatives ap-proached for one last look at the body. As a parting gift to accompany the soul, should it find the journey lonely, they place a flower in the box with the body. This is selected from the wreaths flanking both sides of the altar, and is usually a lily, whose fragrance it is hoped will subdue the odor of cremation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The lid is nailed back on the box, which is then removed to the funeral car, a ponderous vehicle with ornately carved, black superstructure. At the crematory the box and the deceased body will be burned. The next morning h near relative will visit the crematory and, with a pair of chopsticks, will salvage the neck bone from the charred remains. This **Adam’s apple&quot; is supposed to Indicate whether the person was good or bad. The relic is kept for a period of time, varying according to the Buddhist sect, but usually thirty-five to forty-nine days, during which time the soul is said to be in the room or near vicinity. Then the bone is removed to the temple and kept in a special place under a new name, a name for the soul in its new home. Periodically, on the anniversary day of the dead, the Buddhist priest will come to the home and pray that the soul will successfully reach the future world. Not to be forgotten is the money consideration that will be given to the priest for his special prayers for the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* What a contrast these two ceremonies have presented! The Buddhist ritual that no one can understand, and the simple truths that everyone could understand spoken by the Japanese minister who read from the Bible. These truths from the Bible rise above religious formalisms &quot;to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; ... to comfort all that mourn&quot;. —Isaiah 61:1, 2,</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">RAZIL has more buried treasures than any other country in the world. Whether they be the tremendous supplies of gold, silver, diamonds and other precious stones, or the untapped deposits of coal, petroleum, manganese, uranium and tungsten, she has more. Her surface has hardly been scratched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">For over three centuries half of the gold in the world came from the Amazon. Spanish conquerors were principally attracted to headwaters by Inca gold and Eldorado legends. They found slaves powdering their hair with gold dust to lend it a golden tone. Today Brazil produces more than Four tons of gold each year. And in her borders gold rushes still appear; some 50,000 </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">garimpeiros</span><span class="font30"> (gold-panners) sift the earth for the yellow dust. Recently Amapa was besieged by thousands of gold-seeking fortune hunters. The mad rush was set off after a prospector returned loaded with yellow nuggets from the Jari River tributary of the Amazon. One collected 25,000 dollars' worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The deepest gold mine In the world, “Motto Velho/’ Is located in Minas Geraes. The mine was opened in 1830, and It has been worked down to a depth of over 2,700 meters (1.6 miles). Six thousand men work here and live in Nova Lima, the city built up around this mine. They descend seven shafts by elevator, the first drop being 400 meters. Over 800 tons of ore is brought up daily and it yields about 300 kilos (660 lbs.) of gold a month. Another nearby mine, “Raposas,<sup>0</sup> is connected by overhead cable and sends over ore-loads day and night as men work in three shifts. After these many years of mining, one might think that the heavily worked mine of Morro Velho would be about depleted Df its treasure, but it Is estimated that there are at least one million tons of gold still in reserve,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Amap&amp; State, scene of the recent gold rush, is also a setting for another treasure hunt. In 1945 ore was discovered in these black, humid lands containing an astonishing fifty-four per cent of manganese. More astonishing was the news that it was all on the surface. You can travel miles upon miles over beds of manganese actually exposed to view. Without manganese no steel can be produced. What a treasure house for the steel industry! Ninety per cent of aJ manganese is consumed by the industry. Up till now Russia has been the cnly country able to supply all her own needs; now Brazil has taken second place in the world for manganese reserves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">She is well stocked with other minerals too. Up the Amazon way are the largest deposits of high-quality Iron ore that have ever been discovered In ary nation, in almost pure state, sufficient to supply all other nations for centuries. For many years China was the principal supplier of tungsten. Since Red occupation of China Brazil has taken first place in tungsten. New rich veins of uranium were found in November, 1952, in Minas Geraes, and, as a result, plans have been presented for South America’s first atomic city to be built in Minas near Sao Joao del Rey. Untouched stretches of buried coal in southern Brazil could well supply fuel and save</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">precious lumber, but they have not yet dug into this black fortune. The Amazon basin is believed to be floating on a sea of petroleum as indicated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by the discovery of</span><span class="font3"> enormous deposits to all sides of it, in Venezuela, Colombia, Equador, Peru and Bolivia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sparkling Treasure Galore</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the average treasure hunter, ores and petroleum do not hold out great beauty, at least not as much as would a mine of diamonds, sapphires or aquamarines. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Brazil’s </span><span class="font3">diamonds may not be of the Size of &quot;hen eggs”, but they are known to be the most brilliant in the world. What is more, she produces them in fantastic quantities. The Brazilian-cut “brilliant” is cushion-shaped with eight additional facets for added luster, making a total of sixty-six facets. Since 1720 the diamond has been hunted, dug out and polished so enthusiastically that the annual production runs around 400,000 carats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some famous Brazilian diamohds include: The “Estrela do Sul” (Star of the South), which was found in 1853. The cut stone weighs 128.5 carats and was bought by an Indian rajah for four million francs. It is now kept in the Treasury of Gaekwar of Baroda, India. The “Braganca” diamond (some believe it to be a colorless topaz) was found about the middle of the eighteenth century and this diamond is the size of a literal egg, weighing 1,730 carats </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and preserved in its original state by the </span><span class="font3">Portuguese crown. It is especially esteemed for its unusual clarity and beauty. The &quot;Presidente Vargas” diamond found in 1938 weighs 726 carats and the “Darcy Vargas” diamond, 460 carats. None of these may compare with the largest diamond in the world, the “Cullinam”, which weighed 3,106 carats- and was later cut into nine large stones, including the largest cut diamond, the “Star of Africa”, 530.2 carats, and nearly 100 smaller brilliants. But when you consider that polished diamonds of more than 100 carats are so rare that all in the world may be counted on one’s fingers, and that there are not more than about 400 diamonds around the earth weighing over 30 carats, Brazil certainly has its share of honors for famous gems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In fact, many Brazilian diamonds till this day are passed off as of Oriental origin in order to get higher prices. Back in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1807, John</span><span class="font3"> Mawe, a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">diamond merchant, </span><span class="font3">stated in a commercial tract on diamonds that Brazilian diamonds were flooding European markets and thus endangering their monetary value. False rumors were spread that Brazilian diamonds were much inferior to the South African variety. So after this diamonds from Brazil began to appear in other lands as of foreign origin. In Brazil’s colonial days the Portuguese government bitterly complained that “the largest and finest Brazilian diamonds appearing in London and Amsterdam markets had not come through the Administration’s chests”. The famous blue diamond “Hope” of the British Crown, 45.5 carats of exceptional brilliance, which appeared in London in 1812, is believed to be of Brazilian origin. And Brazil’s treasure house is far from exhausted of this precious gem. Willard Price, in his book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Amazing Amazon,</span><span class="font3"> stated that recently two new veins were discovered, one of them so </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rich that all one has to do is bend down </span><span class="font3">and pick up the diamonds by hand. More than 2,000 good-sized stones were gathered this way in only one week’s time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And then there is the carbonado diamond, or black diamond, a crystal aggregate of very minute crystals of diamonds, used for industrial purposes. Henry E. Briggs, authority on gemmology, says, in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia of Gems,</span><span class="font3"> that “the carbonado of Bahia is the hardest and toughest known substance”. Brazil is the most importent producer of these black diamonds, with Japan and Britain as its principal buyers. In 1895 the world’s largest carbonado was found in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, weighing 3,167 kilos (6,967.4 lbs.) and worth $300,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Diamond Rivals</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More desirable than the diamond is the quartz, essential in the construction of precision instruments. Brazil furnishes ninety-eight per cent of the crystals used by the American industry. Quartz can be purple, yellow or colorless, rivaling the diamond in brilliance because of being so lustrous and water-clear. Certain crystals such as quartz or tourmaline have the property (called piezoelectricity) of developing a charge of electricity when under pressure or tension. Some quartz charges have alternate expansion and contraction, producing oscillations useful in radio equipment. Piezoelectric quartz is a strategic mineral in all the world, and Brazil is its only producer. Two thousand tons of it in one year’s exports brought in fifteen million dollars to commercial coffers. During the last war Brazil kept one hundred United States oscillator plants supplied while they prepared 250 million dollars’ worth of quartz. Brazil’s stock is veritably inexhaustible. And some of them come big too. One quartz crystal weighing a mere 882 kilos (over 1,940 lbs.) was found in Conquista, Bahia. Measuring over 1 meter 15 centimeters, it is now on exhibition at the “Bolsa de Mercadorias”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The diamond’s sparkle may refract light in a variety of colors, but other gems of only one color also have their personal brilliance and unmatched beauty. There is the abundant amethyst, a deep velvety purple. Brazilian aquamarines are much in demand, beautiful fine blue ones of very large size. Then there is the “cat’s eye”, a yellowish or gray-brown stone with a sharp, well-defined line of white light that moves as the stone is turned about, resembling the slit pupil of the eyes of a cat Clear, yellow topaz gems and greenish-yellow chrysoberyl stones are plentiful and sought after. The Brazilian ruby is actually a red topaz, naturally colored or artificially colored by heating. Sapphires are either greenish topazes or light-blue tourmalines. Recently a new gem was discovered in Brazil, slightly greenish yellow, and now named Brazilianite. One of these weighing 19 carats is in the American Museum of Natural History in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The treasures in the Amazon area alone are enough to make mankind rich, not to speak of those in the rest of the world. Jesus taught mankind of other riches laid up “where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break in and steal”. This enduring treasure, he said, is the knowledge of the Almighty as contained in His Word, the Bible. Of these riches Solomon, who was a type of Christ, wrote: “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, and the profit thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.”—Matthew 6:19-21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font3"> Proverbs 3:13-18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan, Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The materially rich and poor alike can receive of this treasure house. Not by digging downward for it, but by looking upward, to the One Who has created both spiritual and material riches in abundance for the everlasting entertainment and happiness of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font4">HE number, kind and lack of uniformity In modem measurements of length, size and quantity are maddening. The “Miscellany&quot; column In Britain's Manchester </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian Weekly </span><span class="font4">recently showed that there are many measure' ments besides just gallons of water, rundiets of wine, kilderkins of beer, pecks of com, rehoboams of champagne, bolts of cloth, lasts of wool and seams of glass. Celery, for In* stance, is sold by &quot;rolls&quot; containing eight heads if washed and twelve if dirty. There is the bunch of carrots, flat of cucumbers, hand of radishes, and sieve of apples or potatoes, “which contains 56 lbs. in Northern markets but only 52 lbs. in the South'*- Fish goes by the trunk, quintal or “kit&quot;. In a standardization of one frequently conflicting measure the British Standards Institute produced a “teaspoon&quot; that would hold the same amount of medicine every time. The one they settled on holds 100 minims. A minim, of course, equals one drop of any liquid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More or less “liquid** measurements have also been applied to distance. Charles Lamb determined his walking distances by ale and beer measure, saying, “Now I have walked a pint,&quot; or, “Now I have walked two pints.&quot; He was neither alone nor original in this, however, for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font4"> pointed out that one authority on Turkestan wrote: “It is a land where distances are reckoned by the time it takes to drink a pot of Kokchai or eat a bowl of pilaff; so that you may ask your way to the local Soviet and be told, ‘It is four pots of tea away.’ ” Similar measurements are used by the Dutch canal travelers, who measure the distance by the number of pipes they smoke, and in Burma where the equivalent of a mile is a word meaning “to sit&quot;. It is used to indicate the distance an ordinary man can walk without taking a rest. In parts of modem Germany, said the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font4"> signposts may still be found that mention not distances but time, simply stating that a place is five or ten minutes away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*2? The average schoolboy will tell you that even standard measurements are difficult enough, and most people will agree with him. In the United States everyone knows that 12 inches make a foot and three feet make a yard-Many know that 54 yards make a rod, and some that 40 rods make a furlong and eight furlongs (1,760 yards) make a mile. Of course, to be really versed in measurements, one should know also that three miles make a league; but once this has been learned, one finds that In another field surveyors call </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7.92 Incites a link, </span><span class="font4">100 links a chain, and 80 chains a mile. Further combinations of pints, quarts, pecks, bushels, grains, ounces, pennyweights and drams all add up to such confusion of weights and measures that it is indeed an unusual man who knows them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sub>t</sub> Many of these measurements have evolved from earlier haphazard forms of determining distance. The mile comes from the Latin </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">milte passuwm,</span><span class="font4"> 1,000 paces. Since the Roman pace was a double step, each pace was about five feet in length, and In the United States a mile now equals 5,280 feet However, in Holland the mile is about two thirds that distance, and in Norway it is seven times the United States length. The fathom is used in measuring the depth of water. It comes from an Anglo-Saxon word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">faethm, meaning “embrace”, and criminally</span><span class="font4"> applied to the length of rope between the two hands when the arms were outstretched. It is now six feet. The furlong (220 yards) originally meant “length of a furrow&quot;, and was supposed to be the distance oxen could plow without stopping to rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man's attempts at measurement vary in accuracy from general references to a “heap&quot; or “pile&quot; to that of a millionth of an inch in optical work. His measurements vary in size from the angstrom unit, 254,000,500 to the inch, to a light-year, nearly 6,000,000,000,000 miles. One of the few scientific attempts at solving this muddle of measurement is that of the metric system, which unifies the measurement of length, area and volume in multiples of ten (a kilometer is 1,000 meters, a centimeter 1/100 of a meter). Yet as long as England and America refuse to change to this progressive system that is accepted in much of the world, but hold to rods, furlongs, acres, and have several kinds of gallons, three kinds of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">weight (avoirdupois, </span><span class="font4">troy and apothecaries’) and other confused quantities and lengths, there will be no solution to the maddening muddle of modern measure ment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">“How Are the Dead tp Be Raised Up?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font39">T</span><span class="font30">HE non-Jewish and non-Christian world of the apostle Paul’s day did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. They believed in the teaching of the inherent immortality of the human soul. They understood such soul to be an immaterial, intelligent thing dwelling in the human body and acting through it until death overtook the body, and then leaving the body to continue its conscious existence elsewhere. The pagan believers in such immortality of the human soul reasoned that if the soul did not die, how could there be a resurrection of the dead and why was a resurrection of the dead even necessary? They did not believe the Bible, which says that man is a living soul and does not possess an immortal soul. “And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of Ute*, and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font30"> And if this soul (man) disobeyed God or sinned, it would surely die, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Genesis 2:17; Ezekiel 18:4, 20) Pagan believers did not believe these Bible texts. They believed the soul to be immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Hence it is that we read about Pauls first visit to Athens and his talking to the pagan Greeks there: “But certain ones of both the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers took to conversing with him controversially, and some would say: 'What is it this chatterer would like to tell?' Others: 'He seems to be a publisher of foreign deities/ This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.” (Acts 17:18, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font30"> So it was not strange that Paul should be met with unbelief or wonder when he climaxed his speech to the Greek council of the Areopagus by saying: “God . . has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.” When the Grecian believers in human immortality of the soul heard Paul mention the resurrection of the dead, “some began tn mock, while others said; ‘We will hear you about this even another time.’ ” (Acts 17:19-32, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.) </span><span class="font30">This proves that the Bible teaching of a resurrection and the theory of an immortal human soul cannot be harmonized, because the latter is of pagan origin and is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Throughout the Bible the doctrine of the resurrection is taught. The prophet Job wrote: &quot;O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that' thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.” (Job 14:13,14) Jesus, as recorded at John 5:27-29, according to the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation<sub>f</sub></span><span class="font30"> stated: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” At the mouth of these two witness-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">es is the truthfulness of a resurrection established.—Deuteronomy 19:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much speculation has taken place as to how the resurrection of the dead will occur. A very learned Presbyterian clergyman back in 1891 tried to explain that the resurrection would consist in a regathering and revivifying of all the bones and sinews and all the flesh and skin, etc., that had ever constituted human bodies, no matter how they had been disposed of—by fire, disintegrating in the grave, or otherwise. Yes, no matter if parts had been taken out, destroyed, eaten or if they had rotted and gone as fertilizer into various fruits, vegetables, grasses, etc., and thus been transformed over and over again and assimilated by other living matter or creatures. To him, the resurrection would occupy only a part of a 24-hour day, during which the air would be black with hands, arms, feet, fingers, bones, skin, sinews, etc., of the billions who have lived and died, all these seeking the other parts of their respective bodies. After the bodies were thus fitted together, the human souls would come from heaven and hell and be imprisoned in such resurrected bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this way the clergyman tried to explain what his religious creed calls “the resurrection of the body”. The Bible does, indeed, speak much of the resurrection of thedead, but speaks nowhere of the &quot;resurrection of the body”, meaning the identical original body with which a person died, bit for bit, atom for atom. Therefore the Bible doctrine of a resurrection does not call for any such fantastic scene as the religious clergymen described prior to the time of the world’s judgment. Today we appreciate that the absolute basis of all earthly matter is a particle of electrical energy and that all particles of energy are alike. We can see that one particle is as good as another and that to re-create a person it would not require Almighty God, the Supreme Scientist of the universe, to use the identical particles that formed tile person’s body at the time he died. What difference would it make, as the electronic building blocks of all matter are alike? The creedal doctrine of the “resurrection of the body” with its ghastly conception of the resurrection day is not only unscientific but unscriptural as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What makes a re-created human the </span><span class="font3">same individual character he was before? It is not the same material out of which he was constructed before, but it is the individual’s personality with all the peculiar traits, propensities, knowledge, memory and mental development that he had in his previous existence. That is what makes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font3"> what distinguishes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you.</span><span class="font3"> The apostle Paul shows there could be no “resurrection of the body”, despite what religionists claim or teach. In answer to the question “How are the dead to be raised up?” he proves it is not the old body that has disintegrated to the dust of the earth that comes back, but a new body re-created to fit the life pattern of the individual.—1 Corinthians 15:35-42, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus we see that a resurrection is made sure by Jehovah God’s provision through Christ. It will not take place according to any pagan Platonic theory of the immortality of the human soul, nor through any </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">conception</span><span class="font3"> of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pythagoreanism. These </span><span class="font3">teachings are based upon the false satanic lie that the soul dies not. (Genesis 3:4) Such teachings of pagan philosophers are unproved imaginations that really offer no hope or means of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The resurrection comes through the power of an Almighty God, possessing ability to retain in memory all who are in the graves and having power to re-create the souls that have died and for whom Christ provides a ransom. This is not too great a task for a God who has created heaven and earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Puerto Rico</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T</span><span class="font3">HE “Rich Port” of the Caribbean sea —that is what the builders of the Spanish empire called the capital city of the small island they piously named San Juan Bautista. And it was a rich port of a prosperous island for several centuries. After a time, however, the island and its capital city traded names, and now we know the city as San Juan and the island as Puerto Rico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">San Juan is still a rich port that has grown to a city of nearly half a million people. The island as a whole, though, is not what one would call rich. There is much poverty among the people even though the island has been under United States control for about 55 years. On this stretch of land 100 miles long and 35 miles wide live about 2,200,000 people, or more United States citizens than in the combined States of Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and Vermont, If one travels through the mountains at night the countryside seems to mirror the starry sky, as lights can be seen glowing in all directions from the little homes and thatched huts scattered throughout the hills and valleys. In fact, it is a crowded island, the third-most densely populated agricultural country in the world, with over 600 people to every square mile. Just think, if the United States were all as densely populated as Puerto Rico, it would have a population of one and a third billion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In recent years the people of this beautiful-island have been given something new to think and talk about. It is the good news that Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to the people about the promised righteous government of Almighty God. The Puerto Ricans have responded enthusiastically to the message. In 1944, the Watch Tower Society sent its first missionary representatives to the island. That year only 14 persons were having a part in the preaching work. Four years later the number increased to 160; last year it leaped to 590, and this year there are more than 680 of Jehovah’s witnesses in Puerto Rico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great majority of the people in Puerto Rico are nominally Catholic, but in actuality only a comparatively small per-- centage regularly attend the cathedrals and churches of the country. Many are realizing that the fruits of four centuries of domination by the Catholic church are not those of truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Last year a new missionary home was established in San German by the Watch Tower Society. The missionary group was composed of just four young girls, but they might as well have been an invading army as far as the local priest was concerned. When he awakened to the fact that these witnesses were calling on the people in the town, he rushed into action. Driving his jeep, he headed for the houses among the hills where the girls had begun their missionary work. There he called from house to house, inquiring everywhere if they had bought any of the books from the American girls, and if so, they were told to burn them. Actually this anxious activity on the part of the priest did much to publicize the work. As a friendly policeman said to the missionaries, “The priest never went around to visit the people, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now he is everywhere, and it is just because you are here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Telling of a leaflet the priest had published warning his “Dear brethren in Jesus Christ” of the work being done by these witnesses, one of the missionaries wrote: “The day after the leaflets were circulated we noticed everyone looking out the doors and windows to take a peek at us. We didn’t know what was the matter until one favorable storekeeper ran out after us to 'give us one of the leaflets.” One lady who was visited by the priest and urged to burn her copy of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> told the priest that she was going to keep it and read it despite what he said because it explained the Bible. When her husband came home and heard what the priest had done he was so angry that he made it a point to read the book also. As a result, when the missionaries returned on their next visit, they found the whole family so excited about it that they were all talking at once, trying to say how much they enjoyed the book. A study was arranged. This family attended the next circuit assembly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">held by the witnesses. Now, as</span><span class="font3"> they speak to their neighbors, they refer to themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Puerto Ricans are interested in the subject of personal liberties and political freedom. They have learned much about the true concepts of freedom and how to defend it as a result of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the town of Bayamon near the capital of Puerto Rico, the mayor flatly refused permission to the witnesses for use of the public plaza for a lecture, using the weak excuse that the new plants and young trees might be damaged. However, the witnesses suspected he was more concerned about the large Catholic church also planted solidly in the center of the plaza according to the custom in most Latin-American countries. After a number of interviews with officials, the*witnesses decided to go ahead with the lecture on the Bible despite his refusal to grant a permit. Although the mayor angrily threatened </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">immediate arrest, the </span><span class="font3">chief of police showed quite a different attitude when some of the publishers talked to him. He said he had read of our court battles for freedom, and added, with a typical Latin gesture, that in his opinion the mayor’s view of such things extended only to the end of his nose. So the talk was given and some 400 people were present to enjoy it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The position of most Puerto Rican women is not like that of women in the United States. Many of them rarely leave the neighborhood of their little home, and some may get to the center of town no more than a half dozen times in a year. So invitations to go to a Bible meeting or in the witnessing work with Jehovah’s witnesses frequently bring such replies as: “But my husband never allows me to go out unless he goes with me”; &quot;My husband is so </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jealous I can't even go to the store </span><span class="font3">alone”; “No, I couldn’t possibly go, I have to be here to serve my husband his food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nevertheless, many women are now realizing that their obligations to God are of first importance, and that their husbands are not completely helpless when left alone for a few hours. One of the missionaries in the town of Caguas wrote about some of the comments she heard while going to a district assembly with a group of eleven women who were all packed into one station wagon. The trip was only twenty miles, but it was quite an event for most* of them. Their remarks were to the effect, “I have never done this before. It feels so good to be able to get away and meet people.” Such new-found freedom is a wonderful thing for them and has served to greatly enrich their lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">On Top of the World!</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">&lt;$&gt; Fourteen years ago Edmond P. Hillary, a New Zealand beekeeper, told his mother: &quot;Some day I will climb Everest,” the highest mountain in the world. He did! Together with the famed Sherpa guide Tensing Norkay he climbed to the top of the 29,002-foot Mt. Everest on May 29, but the news did not reach' the world until runners from the expedition's base camp reached the radio post at Namche Bazar. The success of the British expedition was attributed to the good weather and the excellent leadership of Colonel H. </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">C-</span><span class="font24"> J. Hunt. Ever since the mountain and its height were first recorded by Sir George Everest, the icy monster has excited man's spirit of conquest, and ten expeditions since 1922 tried to reach the top of the world. But they ended in failure and with the death of many climbers. One noteworthy expedition was in 1924 when G. L. Mallory and A. C. Irvine were seen almost on the peak, but then a mist closed in and they were lost to sight, their fate unknown. Since their day, however, the height of Mt. Everest may have changed, and it was hoped that the successful British expedition would shed light on the often-disputed height of this Himalayan giant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">U. S. Atomic Cannon Booms</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">For the first time in history an atomic shell was fired from a cannon (5/25), Set off by remote control, the huge 85-ton 280-mm. cannon fired across the sands of Frenchman Flat in Nevada. After traveling seven miles in about 20 seconds, the shell was detonated by a time fuse. The atomic shell, a projectile eleven inches In diameter and weighing about half a ton, burst like the sudden birth of a new sun close to the desert floor. Soon the blinding brilliance evolved into a rolling white-orange cloud that rapidly rose to a height of 20,000 to 30,000 feet. The purpose of the blast was to test the shell’s possibilities for battlefield use. It is interesting to note that this comparatively small shell possessed about half the power of the huge bomb that burst over Hiroshima in 1945, and which had to be carried in a giant B-29,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">South Korea Balks on Armistice</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The U. N.’s revised proposal for a Korean armistice found it hard going when South Korea refused its support. South Korea’s Major General Choi boycotted the Panmunjom sessions when the proposal was presented to the Communists. He said he thought that the U. N. proposal was absolutely unworkable and that it would result in the prisoners’ eventual return to communism. Acting Premier Pyun Yun Tae said (5/29) that if the UN. proposal was accepted, South Korea would withdraw her forces from the U. N. Command and would block all attempts of the five custodial nations to supervise Korean prisoners not desiring repatriation, Mr, Pyun declared: &quot;We. are ready to use our armed force and would even be willing to shed blood fighting troops of those nations.” President Syngman Rhee, speaking (5/30) at a naval academy, also stated: &quot;Peace here is up to ourselves. Any international discussion about this will be of no validity at all.” South Korea’s resistance declined, however, when the U. N. showed it did not intend to withdraw its proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">'Might as Weil Forget tJ. N-'</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">U, N. delegates pay respectful attention to the views of the leader of the majority party In the U. S. Senate. Therefore imagine their surprise (5/26) when Senator Taft of Ohio, majority floor leader, declared that if the truce efforts failed the U, S. “might as well forget the United Nations as far as the Korean war is concerned”. “This statement,” he said, “is going to shock a good many people who still believe in the .United Nations. I believe in the United Nations myself, but not as an effective means to prevent aggressions.” (New York Times, 5/27) Repercussions came quickly. President Eisenhower said he did not agree and that “if you are going to go it alone one place, you of course have to go it alone everywhere”. Republicans as a whole shied away from the controversy. Democrats for the most part were silent. But one highly placed democrat asserted: &quot;The Administration has no foreign policy until and unless Taft approves one.” Presumably the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">positions of Taft and Elsenhower reflected strong opposing currents of U. S. opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">8-Power Bermuda Conference </span><span class="font24">^<sub>s</sub>Hie Big Four conference wanted by Britain’s Prime Minister Churchill turned into a Big Three conference. The Big Three meeting was proposed by the U, S. to harmonize the views of France, Britain and the U. S. &quot;so that the Interests of peace may be advanced”. The three governments accepting, the appointment in Bermuda was set for late June. The Soviet government warned (5/24) that it did not like the conference and that it would likely heighten rather than lessen international tension. Clearly, Moscow, which wanted a meeting of the Big Four, was worried about the gathering of the Big Three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">The Dulles’ Mission</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">John Foster Dulles became the first U. S. secretary of state to make a journey to eleven countries of the Middle East and to Greece. Upon his return Mr. Dulles declared (5/29) that his mission had “laid a new foundation of friendship”. In a formal statement he said that typical conditions that create &quot;fear, bitterness and weakness” were: &quot;The Suez base dispute between Egypt and Britain: the uneasy armistice and economic warfare between Israel and the Arab states; the problem of Arab refugees; the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir; the prevalence of poverty.” He also stated that the U. S. &quot;is determined to find a way toward a broader unity [in which] the nations of the Near East and South Asia may live together”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Second MIG Lands In Denmark</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The Danish island of Bornholm became (5/20) the landing field for the second Communist MIG-15 jet fighter plane when a 21-year-old Polish Air Force flier made good his es</span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">cape from his homeland. Coming in at high speed, the pilot landed in a 600-yard drill field • and came to a halt against a </span><span class="font24">cluster of trees. Upon emerging from the partly damaged plane, he requested political asylum, which the Danish government granted. The refugee flier said: &quot;I planned to escape as long ago as 1950, but I realized that my only chance of escape would be if I joined the Air Force.&quot; The 21-year-old pilot claimed that he was a friend of Lieutenant Jarecki, who had fled his country in March and who was the first Communist flier to place a much-wanted MIG-15 into Western hands. In the meantime Lieutenant Jarecki had visited the U.S., where he heard that the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee had approved a bill (5/26) to grant him political asylum. One representative who advocated granting the Polish flier political asylum in the U.S. said that it would have a &quot;tremendous psychological impact” behind the Iron Curtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">The Exodus from East Germany </span><span class="font24">•$&gt; During the last part of May the West German government had an all-time peak in the number of refugees fleeing from East Germany. During just four days the daily refugee influx doubled that of the previous weeks. On one day (5/29) East Germans to the number of 3,793 escaped to the Western zone. Officials' were somewhat puzzled as to the sudden increase, but it was apparent that most of the refugees were driven by hunger. One Western official said: “Many of them first ask. for .bread and then for registration as political refugees.” With the refugee increase, the West Berlin government also reported a decrease in the number of those who flee to West Berlin but later change their minds and go back to the Soviet zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kenya Battle Zona</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">In an attempt tb </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">hem in </span><span class="font24">and cheek the Mau Mau movement, the Kenya government (5/29) sealed off central Kenya, including all three Kikuyu tribal reserves. Also sealed off from the rest of the country were the Meru and Embu districts to the east. Special permission is necessary to enter or leave the sealed-off area. In effect this area is a battle zone and is no place for noncombatants. Meantime, the Mau Maus have continued to employ regular guerrilla tactics, the forested mountains furnishing them with excellent hide-outs. Thus there has come abopt a bush warfare similar to that existing in Malaya. Mau Mau guerrillas have been getting their food supplies by making cattle raids on their fellow Kikuyu tribesmen. In one raid, 400 head of cattle were stolen and driven off to Mau Mau hide-outs. However, a scorched-earth policy is being carried out on the edges of the forests to deprive the Mau Maus of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Philippine 3-Party Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">For the first time in the Liberal party’s postwar history it had to make a choice. Would it renominate President El-pidio Quirino or nominate ex-Foreign Secretary Carlos P. Romulo ? The answer came (5/24) when the convention unanimously endorsed Mr. Qui-rino’s candidacy. Immediately General Romulo broke from the Liberal party, saying: ‘Through devious machinations and gross applications of pressure on delegates that have nothing in common with democratic processes, President Quirino has succeeded in having himself nominated.” Promptly Mr. Romulo launched the new Democratic party (5/26). It was believed that the effect of the third party may greatly improve the chances for the election of Ramon Mag-saysay, the Nacionallsta party’s candidate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">* Ecuador recently expert </span><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">enced an airlift that; in the opinion of some aviators, may have been a more difficult operation than the famous airlift Into Berlin, It happened Chis way: Ecuador had its heaviest rains in thirty years. By Ute March the roads between the highlands and the coast were washed out. Soon the only rail link between Quito and (Guayaquil snapped) separating the capital and the other mountain areas from the coast. This was critical because tile highlands depended upun the coasl-ul region for sugar and rice, the main staple in Ecuadorian diet The tension mounted. The outlook seemed bleak until an airlift was worked out by the I J. S. am basN attar and the Ecuadorian government. Ten C-47 cargo planes were assigned to cany sugar and rice. Fur three weeks they maintained a lifeline over the Andes mountains, which, are more than 15.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">feet high betwe^i the coast and Quito, m alL the airlift carried almost LOGO tons of supplies. President Ibarra expressed to the LLSl govern' ment the ‘‘heartfelt appreciation&quot; of the Ecuadorian people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The plight of famine-stricken Pakistan was aggravated In May when swarms of locusts began to devastate vast sections of the country's farmland. It was feared the locust attack might continue until Or* tober<sub>±</sub> as the heavy monsoon raing had speeded up locust brk laying. Low-flying planes began to spray insecticides over Infested areas. But last year In spite of these measures. the province of Sind alone suffered about $4,000,000 locust damage. Thia year the situation is critical: an abundance of locusts, a shortage of wheat. In the village of Dubai hawkers were selling roast locusts at prices competitive</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">with, wheat. But it Is gladdening to know that the wheat shortage may soon be over. President Eisenhower decided (5/251 to support congresslon al action to loan 1,000,000 tons of wheat to Pakistan. With the country plagued by famine and nuw by locusts, the wheat will indeed be lifesaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">They Will Be Conquered!</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt; Man has conquered the highest mountain, but is still plagued with unconquerable^: food shortages, cold and hot want and the neverending need for a string of conferences to lay foundations for peace, wldch are soon shat* tered. But God's kingdom by Christ Jesus will soon conquer them! 'Tn his days shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be no more. There shall be abundance of grain In the earth upon the top of the mountains.&quot; Jehovah can do this!—Psalm 72:7, 16, Am* Stun* Ver.</span></p>

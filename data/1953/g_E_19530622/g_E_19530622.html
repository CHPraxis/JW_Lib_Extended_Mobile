<p><span class="font26">The Never-ending Battle for Your Mind</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">S</span><span class="font18">O YOU think you are an independent thinker! Well, you may be right, and you may be a hundred per cent wrong. Powerful forces are battling incessantly for the conquest of your mind, to checkmate reason, and to make pawns of the brain cells that do your thinking. The ammunition fired at your mind is propaganda. It may be true, it may be false; it may be harmless, it may be dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">But do those who entertain these ideas, whether true or false, really make up their own minds, or have they been made to think what someone else wanted them to think? Looking back through the corridors of history, one can see a long trail of battle casualties. Myriads became casualties in Hitler’s “master race” propaganda campaign. Hitler, adept at pumping secondhand thinking into the minds of men, wrote in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf:</span><span class="font18"> “Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made to see paradise as hell, and also the other way round, to consider the most wretched sort of life as paradise.” Hitler was a genius at treacherous propaganda, but Stalin out-propagandized Hitler. Hence the mind of man is just as vulnerable as ever. That is why psychological warfare is such a potent weapon today. It is used by both the East and the West. Surely, the pen is mightier than the sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Your mind is constantly under fire from the propaganda of the printed page. Blitzkrieg attacks, prolonged assaults, ambushes, and fifth-column tactics are employed. The newspaper, innocuous though it may seem, has the power to benumb reason and control thinking. News can easily be twisted. All newspapers have policies, political or otherwise, and they have </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">pet </span><span class="font18">aversions too. Hence, “coloring” the news is widely practiced. “Color” becomes downright dazzling in editorials. So overwhelming is it that one authority on propaganda, George Seldes, in his book </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Facts Are, </span><span class="font18">devotes a chapter to the subject “How to Read the Editorial Page”. A laconic chapter it is: just the word “Don’t”! Those who read them, then, must be on the lookout for slants that may or may not be right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">But never think for a moment that just because the morning newspaper has kindled a fire or bedecks a garbage can it has ended its career as a force in doing people’s thinking. In truth, to a surprising extent, writers of magazine articles and even books are dependent on the daily paper. Every writer has somewhere in his study a file of newspaper clippings dealing with those subjects in which he specializes. Out of that file comes a fair proportion of the facts upon which his books or articles are based. Finally, those books or articles exert a tremendous influence on those who read them. Thus, if original news is “colored”, the distortion is passed on to you by many means. You will be ambushect by propaganda if you are not on the alert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Books are excellent sources for enlightenment. But too many people think there is something godlike about a person who writes a book. Too many people give themselves up completely to an author, as if he were Infallible. In conversation, thej? would not swallow every word, but the printed page holds them in awe. And propagandists make the most of it. So while one should give a sympathetic reading to an author, yet do not believe it all until the thoughts have been examined and approved in the light of reason and logic, for what one reads is not necessarily so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, the printed page is only one of hundreds of methods used to subdue your faculty of thinking. From dawn till dark our eyes and ears are bombarded by the cbmmercial propagandists. Billboards urge us to retain our complexions, attend a thrilling movie, and shun B O and halitosis by gulping mammoth doses of chlorophyll. But too often instead of getting chloro-phylled, our mind gets chloroformed. For even with nightfall the attack abates not. It only gathers momentum when the neon signs come to glittering life. Even the signs that formerly went to sleep at night give you a round-the-clock bombardment. A reflective coating on a sign works miracles: headlights of automobiles light it up as if it were made of a million cats’ eyes. So alluringly fascinating! Who is on guard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is of no use to shut our eyes, for when we get home an even more insidious battie for control of the mind takes place. You are bombed from the air by radio and TV. Children are the first casualties from these “air raids”. They now toddle off to kindergarten reciting beer commercials better than they do Mother Goose rhymes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you prepare your defense in this never-ending battle, remember that booby traps are cluttered everywhere. Going out to the movies? Notice how subtle propaganda is sometimes woven into the plot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The unwary soul may pick up an innocentlooking cartoon, only to have it explode the right viewpoint instead of the wrong. If cartoons and newspapers existed in Jesus’ day as they do now, we wonder how he would have been portrayed? As a red? Most probably! And how many people would swallow it? Most, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Propaganda from the pulpit and political platform can ambush you But the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Street Journal</span><span class="font0"> tells of the new fifth column: “The clever psychologists who mastermind the efforts to sell you such things as toothpaste, cigarettes, deodorants and beer are beginning to resort to methods formerly tried only on disturbed mental patients.” The technique is to ferret out people’s hidden prejudices and yearnings. To probe the public mind, the experts use psychiatric methods on human guinea pigs. This psychiatric or mental science is not entirely new. It was used in a comparatively crude way during the second world war, by professors who prepared “black propaganda” for use against the people of enemy countries. Now propagandists may use it to fool their own people! And, as the Wall Street paper reveals, this evil science is now entering a new stage of development that is horrifying to contemplate. Will it transform the public mind into a helpless pawn of the advertisers and propagandists ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As long as Satan’s evil world exists, the battle for control of your mind is never-ending. But you can erect a mental bulwark. Constant vigilance is its foundation. Then build up an invulnerable defense by filling your mind with knowledge, the truths from God’s Word. “Wisdom is a defence.” (Ecclesiastes 7:12) Heed that Word of God and you will be on the winning side. Satan and his dupes will be checked out in decisive defeat at Armageddon. And the battle for your mind will end—in complete triumph for you!</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">A</span><span class="font18">MONG the many religious organizations claiming to be the one true church is the Roman Catholic, To support her position she lists, among other things, the power to perform miracles. While most of these are said to have taken place in times past, the claim is made that certain ones have continued to our day. One of the better known of the latter is the supposed liquefying of the blood of St. Januarius, which occurs in connection with three annual feasts held in Naples, Italy. It is claimed that these have taken place more or less regularly ever since the year A.D. 1389, or for almost six centuries now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The cathedral Capella del Tesoro, at which these miracles take place, is on such occasions packed. On the altar is exposed a silver bust of Januarius, said to contain his skull. The priest shows the throng a small shrine, resembling a carriage lantern made of glass and silver, inside of which can be seen two vials, one of which contains a hard red substance, supposed to be the congealed blood of Januarius. From time to time the priest turns it upside down to see whether any change is taking place in the dark-red substance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">All the while the people are praying, earnestly begging Januarius to cause the miracle to take place. That group of poor women so conspicuous because of being so demonstrative are known as the “aunts of St. Januarius”. Should the miracle be delayed they become very noisy and violent in their gestures and cries to Januarius that a miracle take place. The red substance becomes liquid, it increases in volume and even foams. The priest calls out </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">“'ll miracolo e lotto!’’</span><span class="font18"> and displays the shrine to the people, who crowd the altar rail to kiss it. Sometimes the miracle takes place within two minutes, but sometimes it will take almost an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Who was this St. Januarius? Honored as the patron saint of Naples, his name was Gennaro, and while myths and legends abound as to the date and place of his birth and his miraculous escapes, such as are recorded in the Bible regarding the three Hebrews and Daniel, the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font18"> tells us that “regarding his history and life, we know next to nothing”. He is believed to have suffered martyrdom in the persecution under Diocletian around A.D. 305. It is said that he was beheaded and a poor woman gathered some of his blood and placed it in a glass vial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Eighteen times a year this miracle is said to happen: daily for more than a week beginning with the Saturday before the first Sunday in May; for eight days beginning with September 19, the supposed date of Januarius’ martyrdom; and on December 16. Rarely does the miracle fail in the May and September expositions, but in that of December 16 the “blood” remains solid more often than not. It is also claimed that on several occasions the relics of St. Januarius were responsible for stopping eruptions of Mount Vesuvius, thereby saving many lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Concerning this miracle the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia goes on to</span><span class="font18"> note: “Let it at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">once be said that the supposition of any trick or‘deliberate imposture is out of the question.” And two Catholic writers, Wet-zer and Welte, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kirchenlexikon</span><span class="font0"> (Church Lexicon), state: “As a natural explanation of this fact, established by numerous eyewitnesses, the most different hypotheses have been set up. None of these, however, has been sufficient to explain the matter, and the only thing left is to admit that God in a wonderful way really enlivens and rewards the faith of the Neapolitan people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Testimony of Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To date the Catholic Church has not permitted scientists to make a chemical analysis of the “blood”. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font0"> admits that “Professor Albani claims to have reproduced all the phenomena with a compound made of powdered chocolate and the serum of milk”. And also lamely confesses as. regards scientific testimony: “Unfortunately, however, allegations have often been made as to the favorable verdict expressed by scientific men of note, which are not always verifiable. The supposed testimony of the great Chemist, Sir Humphrey Davy, who is declared to have expressed his belief in the genuineness of the miracle is a case in point/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some rather enlightening circumstantial evidence as to the genuineness of this miracle is contained in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paganism in the Roman Church.</span><span class="font0"> Therein the historian Th. Trade tells that in 1799 when Naples was occupied by Napoleon’s soldiers the French general and his staff together with a large crowd were gathered to witness the miracle of St. Januarius. When the blood remained hard, and the people became bitter against the French, convinced that their saint was hostile to the French, the general sent a note to the priest in charge of the ceremonies, which read: “If the blood does not liquefy within ten minutes I will order you to be shot!** Before the ten minutes were up the frightened priest cried out </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;f</sup>R miracolo £ fatto!”</span><span class="font0"> and, indeed, the miracle had taken place!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Incidentally another historian records that the Neapolitans were so displeased by this that they disposed of St. Januarius as their patron saint, feeling that he had become a friend of the French, and put Antonius in his place. But when Antonius failed to avert the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, he was dismissed and the Neapolitans restored Januarius to his old position as the patron saint of Naples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Throwing further light on the scientific attitude toward the miracle of St. Januarius is the account that appeared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hibbert Journal</span><span class="font0"> telling of the experience of Frederic Newton Williams, L.S.A., L.R.C.R., a well-known fellow of the Lin-nean Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“When at Naples several years ago, I visited the municipal hospital; and after going around called at the hospital dispensary to have a talk with the American pharmacist under whose superintendence the department was. While there, a young acolyte from the Cathedral of St. Januarius came in and asked the pharmacist for the usual mixture for use at the feast which was to take place the next day, the first Saturday in May. With a smile and a few words of banter, the pharmacist prepared a mixture of ox-bile and crystals of Glauber salts (sulphate of soda), and, keeping the written message, handed the mixture to the messenger to take back to the Cathedral sacristy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“After thus dismissing the acolyte, the practical pharmacist simply remarked to me that miracles took place nowadays, and this one was prepared in a hospital pharmacy with very satisfactory results. The next morning the pharmacist and myself sat in a cafe and watched the solemn procession of the liquefied blood from the church of Santa Chiara on its way to the cathedral. Thanks to my genial companion, the ‘miracle* was quite successful. He also explained that at the celebration which takes place on December 16 in the cathedral only, without the procession, the liquefaction is slower on account of the cooler weather.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further throwing light on the subject is the comment of John Douglas, who as bishop of Salisbury wrote the following in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion:</span><span class="font0"> “I am informed.. * that a composition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crocus martis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cochineal </span><span class="font0">will perfectly resemble congealed blood; and by dropping the smallest quantity of nitric acid among this composition, its dry particles will be put in a ferment, till at last an ebullition is excited, and the substance becomes liquid.” He then goes on to show how the vial holding the blood is so constituted as to make this possible. Being in the shape of an .hour glass, the acid could remain in the lower part while the congealed blood is in the upper. When turned upside down by the priest during the exposition, the acid would come in contact with the “blood”, thus causing it to liquefy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reason and Scripture</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But regardless of the merits of the scientific explanations above given, the case for the miracle of St. Januarius is extremely weak. Admitting this weakness is none other than the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia, </span><span class="font0">which states on the subject: “Probably the most serious difficulty against the miraculous character of the phenomenon is derived from the circumstance that the same liquefaction takes place in the case of other relics, nearly all preserved in the neighborhood of Naples, or of Neapolitan origin. These include relics which are affirmed to be the blood of St. John the Baptist, of St. Stephen the first martyr,...and others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is it reasonable to conclude that the blood was gathered of John the Baptist </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font0">the time of his beheading, and of Stephen at the time he was stoned, and preserved down to this day? Yet on such premises are based the reputed liquefaction of their blood. Is it reasonable to conclude that the blood of St. Januarius was preserved when nothing definite is known as to date of his death and the manner in which he died? The Catholic Church boasts of gaining converts as a result of the miracle of Januarius, but is it reasonable to hold that God has to use such stunts to cause thinking men to dedicate themselves to his cause? And why only St. Januarius and a handful of others? Why should only their blood be preserved, and why should only it be so powerful? And why single out, of all the cities in the world, Naples? And why .should the blood fail to liquefy so often on the December 16 exposition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is there any evidence that Naples is more Christian than any other city? It should be, in view of all the miracles performed there for the past almost 600 years! The fiction of the liquefying of the &quot;Milk of Our Lady” and of the fat of Thomas Aquinas is readily admitted. Why not admit the fiction of the liquefying of blood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reputed miracle of St. Januarius and any other miracle, even if genuine, does not entitle the Catholic Church to the claim to be the true body of Christ. The true Christian congregation long ago put away such dependence upon miracles, they being only for establishing it at the beginning or in its &quot;babyhood'*. It proves its title solely by its loving adherence to God's Word and the kind of fruits it produces. —Luke 6:43, 44; 1 Corinthians 13:8-11; 1 Timothy 3:15, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font0">HERE are two schools of thought regarding the origin of man* One teaches that he is a direct creation of Almighty God, formed in perfection with intelligence imparted to him at the time of his creation. The other maintains that man gradually ascended from a brutish state of lower animals to his present high and civilized condition. The first is taught by the Bible; the second by evolutionists. For centuries a. bit ter battle has raged between the two schools of thought, but recent discoveries by archaeologists confirm the Bible*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All evidence, whether traditional, technical, archaeological or Biblical, points to the plains of Mesopotamia as the cradle of civilization. No civilization, Eastern, Indian or Chinese, can compete with this land in the antiquity of its peoples. Here archaeologists have dug down to the virgin soil and in their findings have dealt with the earliest of mankind. “It was expected,” wrote P* J. Wiseman, C.B.E., “that the more ancient the period, the more primitive would excavators find it to be, until traces of civilization ceased altogether and aboriginal man appeared.” However, “neither in Babylonia nor Egypt, the lands of the oldest known habitations of man, has this been the case.” It was a shocking surprise, said Sir Leonard Woolley of the British Museum, expert archaeologist, to find the very opposite to what was anticipated, namely, “the high state of civilization existing in early times.” Dr. Hall writes In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Near East:</span><span class="font0"> “When civilization appears it is already full grown.” Regarding the earliest Sumerian settlements in southern Babylonia, Dr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">L. W. King, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sumer and Akkad<sub>&gt;</sub></span><span class="font0"> states: “The race by which they were founded appears at that time to have already attained to a high level of culture.” Sir Leonard Woolley wrote in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Sumerians^</span><span class="font0"> page 37: “It is astonishing to find that at this early period the Sumerians were acquainted with and commonly employed not only the column, but the arch, the vault, and... the dome, architectural forms which were not to find their way into the western world for thousands of years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But nowhere is there to be found evidence of a slow development of the human mentality and the emergence of primitive man from his so-called “brutish” state as taught by evolutionists. The “stone age<sup>1</sup>’ is found to be rich and gifted with the art of sculpture. Extraordinary skill is revealed in their mechanical and chemical treatment of metals. A well-developed written language appears. Culture is of high degree. Nothing crude or brutish is found in any of their arts or sciences. Comparisons with many of the works of today display, in fact, retrogression, instead of evolution. Stated Rimmer: “It is not too much to say that the farther back we go into Egyptian antiquity, the more perfect the arts and culture in general seem to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cumulative evidence contradicting thegradua 1-development-o f-civilization theory has grown to such substantial proportions that the theory cannot be maintained. P. J. Wiseman contends, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New Discoveries in Babylonia About Genesis, </span><span class="font0">that “soon after the Flood civilization had reached a peak from which it was to recede- Instead of the infinitely slow development anticipated, it has become obvious that art, and we may say science, suddenly burst upon the world”. For example: Of the eighty pyramidal tombs in Egypt, Cheops is the largest and most important. What is most remarkable about this pyramid is the way in which mathematics enters into its technical construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the seventeenth century Sir Isaac Newton studied this aspect, but it was not till the nineteenth century that the majority of the underlying problems were solved. Albert Neuborger, in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Technical Arts and Science of the Ancients, </span><span class="font0">says: &quot;The mathematical relationships show what astounding knowledge of mathematics and astronomy the ancient Egyptians possessed, and how well they knew the way to apply it to their most striking monumental works. &quot;&nbsp;The four sides of the pyramid accurately coincide with the four cardinal points, and this fact has led some to believe that they were intended to ascertain the dates of the equinoxes. According to Neuburger, the builders of the pyramid knew the &quot;famous ratio jt = 3.14159 of the circumference of a circle to its diameter thousands of years ago; moreover, they applied it in their mechanical arts; it was not rediscovered in later times till the Dutch mathematician Ludolf van Ceu-len calculated it in the sixteenth century’<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The science of modem astronomy teaches that the solar year of our earth written in decimal form is 365.242242 days. The architects of the pyramid knew the exact length of the solar year, &quot;even to the tenth part of the second.&quot; It becomes obvious that the men who planned the pyramid, who cut its stones to fit with perfection, who organized the transportation of more than 85,000,000 cubit feet of masonry, were not the peculiar bushy-hair apelike men with pigmy-size brains pictured by the evolutionists. Rather we see a fully developed man of extraordinary ability, genius and skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further: Over 4,000 years ago the Babylonians had already formulated the fundamental laws of mathematics—laws &quot;which were not rediscovered by the Greeks until fifteen hundred years later”. Edward Chiera, late professor of Assyriology of the University of Chicago, wrote in his book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">They Wrote on Clay,</span><span class="font0"> that so advanced were the Babylonians &quot;that many an Assyriologist gets lost in trying to analyze a list of figures, the interrelations of which he will never be able to grasp unless his mathematical knowledge is greater than is generally the case.... For the complicated calculations which were the joy of the Babylonian mathematicians, the sexagesimal system may even have been superior to the decimal.... Actually, the whole system was so effective that it has imposed itself upon the world. Few people realize that we still follow it in some cases. We still divide the circle into 360 parts, the hour into 60 minutes, and the minute into 60 seconds&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr. Otto Neugebauer of Brown University, known the world over as an authority on ancient mathematics, stated that Babylonians knew much about algebra, even &quot;actually experimented with special cases of logarithms&quot;. On page 33 of his book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Exact Sciences in Antiquity,</span><span class="font0"> he states: &quot;Returning to the Old-Babylonian period we find many more witnesses of the numerical skill of the scribes of this period. We find tables of squares and square roots, of cubes and cube roots, of the sums of squares and cubes needed for the numerical solution of special types of cubic equations, of exponential functions, which were used for the computation of compound interest.” This authority is convinced that the &quot;Pythagorean” theorem, which is that the sum of the squares of the lengths of ttfe sides of a right triangle equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse, was known more than a 1,000 years before Pythagoras. It must be admitted when we are faced with these facts that to be able to Calculate in this manner necessitates a well-developed, intelligent mind, which would immediately exclude monkeys, chimpanzees, so-called ape-men and even the Stone Age men of the evolution theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy and Writing</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Babylonians are called the fathers of astronomy. Every single phenomenon was noted by them with such great care that thdy were able to notice even the changes caused by the precession of the equinoxes. Eclipses of the sun, moon and stars were so carefully<sup>1</sup> described that it is claimed that part of the ancient chronology has now been fixed “without fear of mistake by just such occurrences”. “It is an extraordinary fact,” says Chiera, '‘that modem astronomers have not yet been able to accumulate a series of astronomical observations as long as the Babylonian. For the longest-known series of modem observations—that at Greenwich—was begun only in 1750, And the Babylonians had crude observations for many centuries before their official series began.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">They Wrote</span><span class="font0"> on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clay,</span><span class="font0"> by Chiera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Until recently it was generally believed that writing was an “infant” among the arts of mankind. Now the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, and the present tendency is to claim it among the most ancient of arts. There are approximately a quarter of a million cuneiform clay tablets distributed among the various museums of the world, and these testify of a well-developed society among the ancients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cities were planned. Towns were organized. These were governed by a legal code. There were schools, libraries and hospitals. From well-thought-out* plans forts were built with projecting towers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Supplying large cities with sufficient water presents problems, which the ancients overcame. King Hezekiah is credited with building a tunnel that still receives the water of the Siloam spring. This tunnel, according to Neuburger, “is 1,776 ft. long, and has a curved shape approximately like a capital S..., It must certainly be regarded as a masterly achievement of technical science at that time to have started a tunnel of such length and of a curvilinear shape from opposite ends and to have directed the workmen in such a way that the two sections exactly met. A task of this kind would present certain difficulties even in our day. Unfortunately we do not know how the problem of getting the right direction for the two parts was solved.” The evolution theory of a slow progress of early man in the light of these facts is a disproved assumption, and the idea that an infinitely prolonged period elapsed before civilization appeared cannot stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mechanical and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chemical Wisdom of the Ancients </span><span class="font0">As for the technical trades and skill of the ancients, the mounds of Mesopotamia and Egypt abound with evidence. For example: Vast quarries of Turra near Cairo prove that from an early date open working had been given up in favor of shafts. There are indications that bronze was first made in the valley of the Euphrates, where it was known about 2000 B.C. The Bible speaks of Tubal-cain as “an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Genesis 4:22) This no doubt was mure than a thousand years before the Flood-The expert workmanship in ancient Egyptian necklaces and rings tells of the mechanical and chemical methods that were ingeniously used in treating metals, especially precious metals. Gold leaf was as thin as that made in the eighteenth century of our era. Berthelot found from measurements that such gold leaver of the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties (about 20001800 B.C.) “were only .001 mm, thick (about 4/100000 of an inch). Silver, like gold, was also hammered out to thin sheets (.001 to .0025 mm.)&quot;. Gold was used for filling teeth. Cement was also used. Wire made from precious meta Is w as formed into ornaments. According to Saville, it was often used to fasten loose teeth. Copper wire and cables were already in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arts of both soldering and welding were known before the time of Glaocus. who lived around the year 700 B.C. Welded pieces that date back to thu year 1490 RC. were found Among the excavations at Thebes. (Wilkinson, II, page 258) Neu-burger wrote that the “actual process of soldering probably hardly differed at all from the modern method”. Tin-plating was effected by dipping objects in molten tin, and was so skillfully done by Ute Gauls that tin-plated articles could not be distinguished from silver ones. To the many accomplishments of the goldsmith must be added the chryselephantine work, that is, overlaying statues with gold and ivory. This is now a lost art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The plane and the lathe are preserved in their original form from the ancients. The Lathe is mentioned by Pliny (VTL 198), and a great number of findings testify to the work performed on it. “It can only be surmised,” said Neubumen “that its appearance was something like a grindstone, and that it was a bow-lathe which is probably derived fmm the ancient Egyptians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It still survives in Europe in the ‘turn bench' of the watch and clock makers.” (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Useful Arts and Handicrafts,</span><span class="font3"> by Leland and Ward, Vol. 2.) At a meeting of the Iron and Stool Institute at Birmingham it was admitted that “in spite of modern scientific progress the metal of the 1,600-y ear-old pillar at Delhi (Kutub) was still superior to anything we could produce today; it was freer from inclusions even than Swedish charcoal iron”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crop Rotation and Fermentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both the Hebrews and the early Egyptians were acquainted with manures and modern methods of crop rotation. PHny tells of fields used for pasture lands one year and cultivated the next; that Romans took special care In plowing their land, mostly crossways, and sometimes “plowing the same field seven times”, Tcrcntlus Vano (116-27 B.C.) wrote in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De to rusl ica:</span><span class="font3"> “When ploughing is being done for the third I hue after sowing, little boards arc attached to the share, thus covering up the sown seed in the rows and making furrows in which the rain-water may run off.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fields of rye. barley and spelt were harvested and the crop was turned over to the brewery industry. According to Diodorus, the Egypti<sup>nn</sup> god Osiris is supposed to have introduced into Egypt about the year 2000 HL<sup>1</sup>, a beer made of malted rye, which he states could almost vie with wine in pleasantness of taste and power. Recent researches by Hrozny show where ancient Babylonians also brewed beer from rye, barley and spelt. The original furrn of beer was from bread and is stiff “found nowadays in many parts of Russia as feudal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Egypt flourished with vineyards. No fewer than six kinds of wine were known, Aristotle reports that wines were dried in skins, and then taken out in lumps, which were dissolved in water for drink-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ing purposes. The aroma from the wines was of suih delicious flavor that it was said to be impossible to desist from drinking them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oils and fats were made into a great variety of products. Ointments having very different properties, made by mixing oils and fats with perfumes of every kind, were common. Perfumes were in forms of oils, solids or powders. At this early age sticks of paint were made. Eyelids and the eyebrows were colored. The orange-red cosmetic used to color the fingernail was prepared from the henna plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Refrigeration and Ceramics</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among other things, the most important methods used today for preserving were also practiced by the ancients, that is, cold storage, salting, drying and excluding the air. The Jews evidently used snow to cool their drinks. (Proverbs 25:13) Ice-cellars are mentioned in an ancfent Chinese collection of lyrics, which dates back earlier than the first millennium B.C. The process for making ice artificially was known to the ancient Indians. The Egyptian women of the fifth century B.C. used the method involving vaporization to make their homes more comfortable in the summer heat. As to the quality of their refrigeration Neu-burger writes: “Preserved fish from ancient Egyptian times have'remained unimpaired up to the present day.... In some cases they still look nowadays as if they had just come out of the water. The skin is shiny and has color, and in the eyes one. can still clearly discern the iris.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—The Technical Arts and Sciences of the Ancients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This same authority shows that their , refrigeration was no less remarkable than their brick making. In the fifth chapter of the book of Exodus, mention is made of the making of bricks in Egypt by the Jews, and it is stated that straw was used in this process. The way in which the straw was used remained a mystery for a long time. Recently it was found that “the addition of organic substances, and particularly of straw, to loam, which was afterwards dried, caused the breaking strength of the bricks so obtained to rise from 84 lbs. to the square inch to 269 Ibs. to the square inch: hence the strength of the brick was increased by 244 per cent”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this same period of time, blue and white strips of glass were made. Their unbelievable skill in this field is found in their production of artificial eyes. These artificial eyes were made of all sorts of substances, and Were in some cases compounds. The iris and pupil consist of glass; the sclera (white skin of the eye) of a metal alloy, ivory, pearl, feldspar marble or else entirely of glass. These were placed in mummies, as well as in statues. Whether artificial eyes were made for living creatures is not definitely known, but Ebers considers it not improbable. Artificial stones made of colored glass fluxes were cleverly mixed with genuine stone jewelry. The hardness of these artificial stones equals that of the strass, or imitation diamond of today, and it is speculated that these stones were made in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the field of textiles, the ancients manufactured silks and dyes with unsurpassed skill. Moses wrote of the beautiful hangings of the tabernacle (Exodus 26), which were expertly designed, skillfully made, and artistically magnificent. Herodotus tells about the mail-shirt of Amasis: “What excites our wonder in it, however, is every single thread; for the threads are not coarse, and yet each one consists of 360 single threads, which can all be distinguished/’ Asbestos threads were sometimes added to ordinary threads “in order to obtain fireproof garments”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From almost any field of technical arts and sciences one wishes to select, the accu-mulatlve evidence furnished by the science of archaeology testifies that primitive man was not only acquainted with these arts but exploited most of them to their utmost. Early man’s astonishing abilities, his astronomical, mathematical and physical knowledge, prove him to be not only enlightened but highly intelligent and cultured. Neither the Bible nor Egyptian or Babylonian excavations know anything of brutish cavemen evolving into civilized peoples. These ancient stone and day records testify to the authenticity of the Bible account that “God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them”. (Genesis 1:27, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.</span><span class="font0"> Ver.) This truth will endure forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">would be repelled by the beastly insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Obviously, then, cockroaches have become domesticated, in the sense that they have accommodated themselves to the environments of civilization. With 1,200 species known (there are many wild ones), even the colder parts of the world have their domesticated variety. Five common species inhabit the United States. However, the largest and fattest cockroaches grow in the tropics, although many an American housewife, particularly in the South, may dispute this statement, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P</span><span class="font0">RACTICALLY no housewife needs an introduction to Mr. and Mrs. Cockroach. And why? Because these detestable insects, once eminently tropical, now are cosmopolitan, being found in virtually every nook and cranny of the world. All that many persons have to do is to switch on their kitchen lights some night, and they will be there. Alas though! By the time a courageous housewife has grasped her broom, grabbed her spray gun or applied shoe leather, the speedy night prowlers have made good their getaway by scurrying into inaccessible crevices. Indeed, the uncanny ability of the cockroach to make these quick getaways only intensifies the housewife’s creeping and icy disgust for these prowlers. And we do not blame her. Even a stouthearted Spartan</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Texas-sized roaches being already too big for her!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Domestic cockroaches are finicky about their appearance. Would you believe it? They like to appear beautiful and clean, and if watched, they will be seen constantly making efforts to beautify their person, licking their legs and antennae in much the same manner in which a cat washes its paws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is something about the cockroach’s habits and characteristics that intrigues the naturalists. Then, too, they rank as one of the most ancient of all winged insects. Its ancestry is traced back to the coal age, there being 200 fossil species known. So it is not strange that these defiant night prowlers are often recom-tended as the most suitable type for commencing the scientific study of insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cockroaches belong to a family in which the legs are specially suited for running, as anyone knows who has tried to step on one. They have a short head, flat face and are always looking slightly downward. Most species are somberly colored in black or brown. Surprisingly, there are varieties that exhibit an elegance of form and beauty of coloration. The tropics have these “glamorous&quot; ones. Heightening the roach's generally frightful appearance are its long threadlike antennae or feelers which, together with its crackling appearance, are horribly hideous enough to give housewives that creepy feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ISver&amp;Niffkt Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being rather inquisitive insects, cockroaches like to know what is going on in the pantry, cupboard, kitchen sink and table, desk drawers, etc., and so at night they carry on their reconnoitering. And you probably know the cockroach leaves his calling card: droppings and an odor of which he is the sole proprietor, The cockroach’s BO is caused by glands in the hind-body. In some, these glands are very large and diffuse a strong “underarm&quot; odor. Perhaps the cockroach has not learned about the latest marvel of civilization—chlorophyll!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Practically nothing gives the cockroach indigestion; it is all-devouring. Of course, they have their preferences. Such delicacies as these rate high: leather, ink, paint, hair, sweetened matter, paper, clothing, paste in book bindings, shoes, bones, dead insects, and cereals. Really, their appetite is voracious. There are recorded instances of sleeping sailors on ships bound from the tropics having fingernails gnawed by roaches. It must be strangely disconcerting to wake up in the morning manicured by a cockroach!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The common cockroach lays its eggs arranged In a horny case, opening at the top and shaped like a purse, which she carries about with her for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font0"> time, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">protruding </span><span class="font0">from the end of her abdomen. Finally, Mrs. Cockroach deposits the egg capsule in a crevice in the walls or below the floor. Result: a new family. The youngsters shed their skin several times before it finally hardens and gets dark like their elders'. It is not long before children become grandparents, for the German cockroach is full-grown in four and a half to six months; the American cockroach, in one year. No wonder mammoth sizes are frequently seen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being a formidable enemy of the bedbug, the cockroach does an excellent service in reducing that bug*s numbers. (Who would ever think of importing cockroaches to exterminate bedbugs?) But the roach is still detested. Perhaps this is because he is just too filthy, offensive, foul, and abominable himself, despite his futile self-washings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clean Homes Can Be Infested</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is commonly thought that cockroaches live only in dirty surroundings and that homes invaded by them must be inhabited invariably by people careless in their cleaning habits. Such is not really the case, because these insects are all-devouring. They do not have to eat scraps of human food to live. But carelessness in cleaning does make a home susceptible to a roach invasion. Yet a house can have that wellscrubbed look and still have the pesty night prowlers. All that has to happen is for one of the night-flying kind to enter an open window and deposit an egg-case containing about 16 eggs, and perhaps by the next morning tiny roaches will be scurrying for cover. Since they are so fond of darkness, the first invasion may get by unnoticed. Sometimes, though, a brand-new house becomes abundantly stocked with cockroaches just through a mass night migration from an oversupplied, nearby house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A re Roaches Dangerous?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is a question that has long been debated. Suspicions that cockroaches are disease carriers have always been prevalent, but nothing has been definitely pinned on them. Even now their case is not conclusive. However, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter, </span><span class="font0">issue of February 5, 1949, reported on the tests at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health which revealed that a food-poisoning bacteria called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salmonellae </span><span class="font0">may be carried by the cockroach. These tests proved that cockroaches are capable of acquiring, harboring and spreading one type of this dangerous bacteria. The most frequent outcome of a salmonella infection is common food poisoning, which may involve acute diarrhea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cooking will kill the salmonella germs, but the ever-present possibility is that food may be poisoned after cooking. So if the cockroach carries the germ, then its eating habits could be most dangerous. For these insects love the kitchen table! Perhaps a cake or pie has been left uncovered on it. Mr. Cockroach, delighted to find such an enticing meal and never knowing moderation, gorges himself so swinishly that, just, like the ancient Romans, he must regurgitate his food to make room for more. Here, of course, is where the contamination of the very food the roaches are eating is possible. And then the obnoxious habit of leaving their droppings on food and dishes in the pantry is another source of possible contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tests proved that germs could remain alive on the insect for as long as 78 days. And since it could contaminate food and dishes merely by coming in contact with them, even when a roach is dead the evil it did may live on. It was also proved that bacteria can remain alive on glass dishes for 34 days, on cornflakes for 62 days. Of course, these tests only indicate that experimentally raised and infected cockroaches can act as carriers. Whether or not cockroaches actually do this has yet to be proved. But to ensure the health and mental tranquillity of the family it might be well to hang up the “Cockroaches Not Welcome” sign on your door. But how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Well, once established in a house, it is impossible to starve them out or get rid of them with soap powder. And only a highly skilled person who likes being a night owl can kill cockroaches with his feet. Then it takes much practice because of the scudding zigzag locomotion displayed by the roach in its quick getaways. Hence, extermination by using shoe leather is not only unreliable, but hard on the feet. Besides, it gives one a creepy sensation to squash a fat cockroach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best method of extermination is poison. According to York Research Corporation, product testers for the American Hotel Association, the most effective killer of household insects is chlordane. This is a brown syrupy liquid with a wet-wood smell. This is the killer ingredient in many brand-name insecticides. Chlordane should be applied along crevices formed by comers and baseboard, along water pipes, under refrigerators, etc. By using a mechanic’s oil can with a long spout bent at the tip, it will be possible to squirt roach-killer into these hard-to-get-at places. Complete cockroach eradication calls for absolute cleanliness and absence of dampness. Finally, no food scraps should be left around either in the kitchen garbage pail or on the sink drainboard. Doing all this may keep the cockroach from calling and thus dispel the nightmares of many a housewife.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

First w<sub>e</sub> will take the subway or bus to South Ferry, the southernmost tip of the island, here to choose one of three boat trips. For about ?2.50 we could take a sight-seeing boat all the way around Manhattan, under great bridges, past towering buildings and by the piers where great liners dock, but this three-hour trip, though interesting, would not fit Into our one-day schedule. A shorter trip is the 70c boat ride to the Statue of Liberty, where we can climb into the lady’s crown for an excellent view of the harbor. But for only ten cents we can take a round trip on the Staten Island ferry, riding down across the busiest harbor in the world, watching the towers of the financial district drop behind as we pass barges, lighters, tugs, a freighter or two, and perhaps even a great ocean liner heading for its mid-Manhattan berth.</span></p>

This -small section of now-towering buildings on narrow, alley like streets laid out by the early Dutch composed the entire village of New Amsterdam —the original city of New York, Wall street marked its northern boundary 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;[ Returning to Broadway we go north (right) six more blocks to pass the famed Wool worth building, once the world’s tallest. In the triangular park that It faces is ancient City Hall. It is also at this park that the dilapidated old Third Avenue elevated ends. We follow under this elevated line a few blocks to get to Chinatown and the Bowery. After lingering to windowshop on the narrow streets of Chinatown, we follow the el’ on up the Bowery to Delancey street, where we turn right four blocks to Orchard to watch the animated sidewalk storekeepers of the Jewish section loudly ply their trade. Going north (left) up Orchard we come to Houston street (say it like &quot;house”, not the Texas city), where in a small grassless park middle-aged men bowl without tenpins, rolling the balls to see who can get nearest to the jack at the end of the rink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;£ The tiring walker can here take the IND subway two stops to Washington Square and meet us there, or can come along as we walk left (west) on Houston beyond the elevated, on across Broadway, and turn right (north) on East Broadway to Washington Square. It is here, under Washington Arch, that Fifth Avenue takes root and grows northward. The square’s eight-acre area, once a potter’s field, became the center of the city's most aristocratic neighborhood, and later the habitat of almost every important American writer and artist. In the spring and fall walls of buildings around the south and west sides are used by neighboring Greenwich Village artists for their famed sidewalk exhibitions. The “village”, with its hodgepodge of crooked streets and some of its old Bohemian atmosphere still remaining, is to the square's west and north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;[ In Washington Square we board a Fifth Avenue bus, making sure that it is one that goes up the east side of Central park. While we rest aboard the bus we note that, like all of New York, Fifth avenue is given to sudden changes. There are a few blocks of elegant hotels, then a wholesale district, then in quick succession we pass the Empire State building at 34th street, the library at 42d, Rockefeller Center at 50th (which we will visit later), the fashionable Fifth Avenue shops and Central Park. Along the park we see a new aspect of New York—the homes and apartments of the extremely wealthy. We get off at the Metropolitan Museum of Art at 82d street, the finest and largest in America. We are interested not only in the 6,000 paintings, the medieval armor ^nd other unusual collections, but also in the Egyptian wing to the right of the front door. Here modes of burial and paintings on ancient Egyp-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tian tombs show their pagan belief In immortality, the effort taken to make the “soul” comfortable in the future world, and in one room a funerary papyrus shows the wicked dead being burned In a caldron by a demon. The Taw Cross 19 also evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Directly across Central park is the American Museum of Natural History at 79th and Central Park West. Elghty-two years of research and $30 million worth of collections have been used to transplant the visitor into wild sections of the world to view animals in their native habitat. For 95c we can attend a most interesting program and become familiar with stellar bodies in the domed hall of the adjoining Hayden Planetarium, Both museums are free, hut they close at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The midtown section can be toured at a different time, or the subway will take you from the natural history museum back to this area. If it Is an especially clear day, you may wish to go to the top of the Empire State building to view the city. This will cost $1.20. A block west, at 34th street and Broadway is Macy's, the world's largest store. Eight blocks north on Broadway Is Times Square at 42d street. If you want to skip the Empire State building, or if you are taking the entire trip in one day, it might be well to start here. The brilliantly lighted Great White Way is, of course, best at night. There is nothing with which ^o compare its monstrous signs to see how big they really are unless you count the windows by the side of some of the larger ones and compare their height with the number of stories in various buildings in*your home town. Walking through the Times Square area up to 49th street, we turn right (east) for one loij&amp;^lock to Rockefeller Center, where 15 building^house the consulates of 20 nations, the editorial departments of dozens of magazines, and the offices of 1,000 leading business firms. The RCA building’s elevators are the world’s fastest; the 6,200seat Radio City Music Hall, the world's largest indoor theater. A “behind the scenes” visit to NBC’s broadcasting studios</span></p><img src="g_E_19530622_files/g_E_19530622-6.png" alt="" style="width:313pt;height:128pt;">
<p><span class="font3">costs 75c, or a tour through the Center's buildings and to the observation roof seventy floors above the street costs $1.40. You may see yourself free on a television screen at the RCA exhibition hall on 49th street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">C. Two blocks farther east is tree-lined Park avenue where we view the more luxurious mode of New York living and the famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel. Turning right (south) on Park avenue we must go to the left or right around</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grand Central station, to get inside. The casual eye, however, does not see the monstrous underground rail yard that makes this the largest and most costly terminal in the world. It is so big that 26 of its tracks are directly under 48 others. Trains enter this huge underground terminal by burrowing through a four-track-wlde, two-and-a-half-mile tunnel directly beneath the very tree-lined avenue we just walked down. Thus, where thousands of tourists first enter New York, we conclude our day’s tour. If we made it all in one day, we did well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">&lt;L There are many other things to see and do in New York. Guided tours are conducted through the U,N. building^; cost $1,00. The zoo is in Bronx park. Huge airports may be seen, historical spots visited. But by far the most amazing coming event will be the assembling of Jehovah's witnesses from the world over at Yankee Stadium, July 19-26. That tens of thousands of people should, at their own expense, travel from all parts of the world to hear Bible lectures, and , contribute their labors toward operating a tremendous nonpaid convention organization is astounding in itself; but when it is recognized that these men of many nations, races and colors are all working at unity while the representatives of these nations squabble and bicker a few miles away at the U.N., the unity of true Christianity should impress even the most skeptical of observers. When Jehovah’s witnesses met in Yankee Stadium in 1950, to the amazement of officials, 123,707 people actually did attend one Bible lecture! This coming summer’s great multitude of true worshipers will unquestionably be the greatest sight to see in this city of sight-seeing. You are invited to be with them. Will you accept the invitation? Come any time from July 19 to 26 inclusive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">words have constituted the tools of thought and expression. In the original language of the first pair in Eden, we can well imagine that the names given to the many varieties of animal creatures constituted word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pictures of these creatures, </span><span class="font0">expressing in sound the general over-all impression of their appearance on the perfect mind of Adam. Even in imperfect creatures this God-given ability to transfer the impressions of the mind into vocal sound can be observed. As an instance consider the young child’s first impression of a locomotive so aptly expressed as a “chOo-choo”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Skill and versatility in the use of these language tools are acquired only at the cost of constant effort and practice over a considerable period of time. There must be positive consideration of the matter, for we are living in times when the worn-out patter of radio and press is dished up as a ready-made language that calls for no mental effort, no personal choice, but simply memorization, as in the case of the catechism-trained parochial scholars. How much thought do you give to the words you employ from day to day? In the realm of words do you often find </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">yourself </span><span class="font0">using the wrong tool for the job, or a worn-out tool for some project requiring the utmost precision? Do you take sufficient interest in your speaking jobs to be keenly concerned about knowing and rightly using the proper tools for the various aspects of your speech activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the man or woman who reverences the great Creator, words take on a much same Creator endow man with the gift of speech? Does he not declare himself: “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void”? (Isaiah 55:11) And did he not reveal his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only-begotten Son under the</span><span class="font0"> honored title * ‘The Word”? How fitting, then, that we should strive to cultivate the attitude expressed by the inspired servant of God: “Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord.”—Psalm 19:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Actually, words should become to the sincere worshiper of God the vehicles of kindness, truth and praise. By means of them we commend God to our fellow men, and through our proper use of them we are commended by God. Of Jesus it was foretold hundreds of years before his first presence: “Grace is poured into thy lips.” (Psalm 45:2) True to the prophecy, those who heard his words on earth spontaneously testified: “Never has another man spoken like this.” (John 7:46, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> Surely something for us to aspire to! And the more so since today the real and present danger to earth’s multitudes is that they are, through lack of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">knowledge, hastening on toward disaster at </span><span class="font0">Armageddon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Imperfect though human language has&gt; become, yet it can with the help of God’s invisible force or holy spirit be made to convey knowledge to others. But today we do not await a miraculous gift of expression. Rather we work hard and strive to be imitators of our great Commander, Christ Jesus. Briefly, this will require our</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">giving careful attention to such qualities of language as tact, simplicity, accuracy, fluency, earnestness and generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tact and Accuracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tactfulness means, among other things, a suiting of the spoken </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">word </span><span class="font0">to the occasion. Thus we avoid blundering, clumsy expressions that grate on the ear of the listener and arouse in his mind a hostile background that will be difficult to eliminate. When comforting a bereaved person it simply would not be fitting to refer to the &quot;corpse” that was their dear one, when the expression “remains” would afford a kindlier approach to the topic. We are here reminded that our spoken words will fail of their purpose unless the listener can partake of them and relish them, or at least appreciate them as being something beneficial to him. Probably you have tasted saltless porridge, and have noted that the immediate reaction was to reach for the salt shaker. How wise therefore the admonition to “let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one”.—Colossians 4:6, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Accuracy of language is what will aid people to quickly grasp the ideas we express. But if one lacks the words to precisely express an idea, then the idea can never be projected clearly on the minds of others. How often is it heard, “I know exactly what I mean but I can't quite find the words to explain it”! Others, when groping for words, use the inferior, vague word for the precise word they know exists, but which they have never learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Precision, then, in language will help us to vocally sound out the truth, untarnished and pure. No room for evasiveness, double talk and dishonesty. In view of the wealth of vocabulary available and the fine shades of difference in the meaning of words, we do well to develop a keen Sense of choice. Here is a field in which discrimination will harm nobody, but rather will be a blessing to the speaker and to the hearer. It adds conviction to the speaker and inspires confidence on the part of the listener.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fluency introduces the matter of how we use the words we do use. Do we spit them out curtly and sharply like the staccato of rifle fire? How much better if they flow evenly and smoothly, as a deep, wide river, carrying our audience irresistibly along to the rhythm of our vocal music! A large vocabulary of usable words will not always achieve fluency. We must practice and train ourselves to express with the voice the thoughts and ideas of the mind, and then develop the facility and the smoothness of the operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Comprehensive Vocabulary</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Generosity in the matter of words does not justify verbiage, which might be likened to forcing our gifts of money on persons not really in need of our charity. Neither will it countenance the niggardly, grudging fewness of words, which usually identifies the man who is not going to go out of his way to “succor the weary with a word”. (Isaiah 50:4, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) </span><span class="font0">Instead of rationing words, the generous soul will fully express the matter, shunning slang and other short-cuts. He will realize that fewness of words is proper in prayer to Jehovah God, who knows our minds and our needs before ever we ask, but a generous sowing of words of truth is what is needed to produce a fruitful crop from the imperfect soil of human minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, then, to enrich our language with words that will aid in developing these above-mentioned qualities of speech is a worth-while objective. It will certainly mean the piling up of an ample stock of usable words in our minds, and the first requisite to achieving this is to be genuinely interested in words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When reading pay attention to the strange words. Look them up in a reliable dictionary. If it Is a word that will serve no particular purpose, do not spend much time on it. But if it seems to be a colorful, expressive word, one that is usable, write it down in a notebook, with its pronunciation, its most common meaning, and a sentence in which it is used. Then from time to time review these words and try to use them in a letter or in conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another effective method of building up a word stock or vocabulary is to give some thought to the study of root words and their derivatives, and to prefixes and suffixes. Seeing that exchange of words is described in our language as “conversation”, let us take that word as an example of what we are considering here. Analysis of this word readily breaks it up into three parts corresponding to the introduction, the body and the conclusion of any composition. The introduction in this case, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">con,</span><span class="font0"> is called a prefix, and is the Latin term for “with” or “together”. The body of the word is from the Latin root verso, meaning </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“I turn</span><span class="font0"> around&quot;, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">while the tion </span><span class="font0">ending indicates the part of speech to be a noun. From this it will be seen that literally the Word “conversation” means &quot;a turning around together”—as of those who dwell or have dealings with one another. Hence the old King James Bible meaning of the word, namely, “conduct; behavior.” Other prefixes that are very common, and a knowledge of which would greatly assist us in correctly determining the meanings of strange words, are: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trans-, er-, para-, de-, epi-, anti-,</span><span class="font0"> etc. A good dictionary will give the basic meanings of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As we move about among the peoples of this present system of things, we shall often be obliged to hear all manner of strange and jarring sounds, vulgarisms, blasphemies, and obscenities. Do they affect us? Do we permit our minds to harbor them and give them unmerited attention? Or, do we shed them as effectively as the armor of righteousness deflects the deadly arrows of the adversary? The answer is to be found in the language we use. How important that it is the right answer, for the Word of Jehovah declares: “Not what enters into his mouth defiles a man; but it is what proceeds out of his mouth that defiles a man.” (Matthew 15:11, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nev: World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> Treasure up in your mind and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heart good things, good words, and </span><span class="font0">you will send out speech that is indeed a blessing to all who hear it.</span></p>

Its effect certainly will I For the one-cent-per-mile turnpike mearw the equivalent of an additional gas tax of 15 cents a gallon (assuming your car travels 15 miles to a gallon). However, since toll roads also moon many milts of zestful, smooth sailing for your car, you may be quite exultant about the new vogue. Happy or disgruntled, this much is certain: the tollgate, once a familiar sight, is re-emerging speedily from a dusty past to haunt you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About 1346 England came up with the ingenious idea of pay-as-you-go roads. Rural areas between cities were too poor to support free ones, 50 toll roads were considered n necessity. Those early loll roads were named &quot;turnpikes”, for an unusually apt reason: a man with a pike a long wooden shaft with a sharp-pointed metal head, was stationed at a collection point. Those who failed to pay the toll were turned back—with the pike if necessary!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By 1830 England had expanded her turnpike network to take in 20,000 miles. To the common people, however, toll roads were as unwelcome as blueberry plc to a white linen suit. But the turnpike idea found its way over to America, and 17R5 saw the ginia, and Little River, 35 miles to the northwest. Fittingly, the leader in turnpikes today, Pennsylvania, was also fur ahead in turnpike development in that bygone era. The Philadelphia-Lancaster turnpike, completed in 1794, was the first toll road in the United States surfaced with broken stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Turnpike Refutes to Die</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Little known is the fact that as late as 1900 there were 1,100 miles of turnpike roads in the state of Pennsylvania alone. But then sumethuig happened: railroad competition became acute. Finally, lack of business drove the turnpikes from the scene by 1920. But the Indomitable idea of turnpikes refused to die. In 1940 the turnpike sprang back like dandelions after a spring shower. That year saw the opening of the first section of the now famous Pennsylvania turnpike, the first supertoll highway. Since then the turnpike idea has flourished so luxuriantly that there are about 800 miles of toll roads In the United Slates and over a thousand more miles in the construction or approved stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With over 52,000,000 cars, trucks and buses zipping along highways, the turnpikes are doing a land-office business. Only expansion is in sight. In fact, the New Jersey turnpike is doing business at a rate</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">that It was not expected to reach until well into 1968! To keep its “business” from going too fast, however, its $l-a-mile-plus-cost fine for every mile per hour over 60 is rigorously enforced not only by a fleet of blue-and-white patrol cars but by a dozen powerful black sedans (capable of doing 120) planted to swoop down on the unsuspecting speeder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Will this second heyday of the turnpikes eclipse the first one? It probably will. In truth every new turnpike dwarfs its predecessor. Planned to even surpass the New Jersey turnpike in magnificence is the 241-inile Ohio turnpike. Meanwhile, the driver is enthralled by all these alluring roads; consequently, opposition to them has come from almost everyone except the motorist himself!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But before discussing why there is any opposition at all to these extraordinary highways, it is well to mention the innumerable benefits of toll superroads. Primarily, they offer a fast, easy and quick way of travel. Traffic lights are eliminated. Bump-free turnpikes bypass congested cities, leapfrog valleys on mammoth bridges, tunnel through mountains and allow you to whiz along at a mile-a-minute clip. Advocates of the tollgate effervesce that pay-as-you-go roads are better than the suffer-as-you-wait kind'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Why Opposition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some powerful reasons have been advanced for opposing the turnpikes. For example, the Bureau of Public Roads of the United States Department of Commerce has consistently opposed toll roads because “they are unnecessarily expensive, fail to break urban traffic bottlenecks, impose a form of double taxation since the motorist pays for roads through highway taxes, obstructs the nation's nontoll interstate highway system, and ducks the main issue of financing roads with increased taxes”.—Nation^ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Business,</span><span class="font0"> May, 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To analyze one of these principal objections is enlightening: that toll roads impose a form of double taxation on the motorist. How is this possible? Because the motorist pays for motor registration, for state license plates, and also for state gasoline taxes in varying degrees of stiffness, some states imposing taxes from seven to nine cents a gallon. On top of this the motorist' pays a two-cent federal gasoline tax per gallon. All of these taxes are in effect road tolls! Now when a motorist streaks along on a toll road he is paying, in addition to the above-mentioned road tolls, a 15- to 22-cent tax on every gallon of gas, depending on the amount of the turnpike’s toll. (Toll on the Pennsylvania turnpike is l^ent per mile, the New Jersey turnpike, approximately cents.) Thus the motorist, not to consider his already being taxed up to the hilt with income taxes, personal property taxes, city auto taxes, etc., winds up paying more for road tolls than he does for gas to propel his car!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Actually, then, when turnpikes first appeared there was a more justifiable reason. For a hundred years ago states did not collect a fat tax on every gallon of oats, and it was not necessary to buy a license plate for the buckboard wagon. Today it is different. How much out of the average dollar spent for gasoline alone goes for federal and state taxes? About 26 cents'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To alleviate the dire dearth of modern highways states toy periodically with the idea of increasing gasoline taxes. Generally, petroleum companies oppose this. But even when gas taxes are increased, oftentimes the amount of new highway construction is barely perceptible. What happens to the revenue that flows into state coffers? An electrifying answer comes from the Bureau of Public Roads, which claims that states since 1924 have diverted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">more than $3,000,000,000 to iwnhighway uses! Moreover, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coronet</span><span class="font3"> magazine (An* gust, 1952) declared that in 1950 states diverted $217,038,000 tn nonhighway projects, This means that, out of every dollar received from gasoline taxes, states spent only 54 cents on direct highway work. Other estimates place this figure at only 10 cents! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Nation^ Busineux,</span><span class="font3"> May, 1951) No wonder tollgates are sprouting up again'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having failed to use adequate transpor-ration tax revenue for highway projects, states jump on the toll-road band wagon, bemoaning the sad shape of their highways. They then opine that the only solution is to float bond issues to construct toll highways. So the driver is in reality being sold down the river when he pays a toll, a form of double taxation. Many are the other objections to toll roads, but by the discussion nf just one, it becomes downright apparent that the tollgate is not the panacea for the sickly shape of American highways, ftor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one thing,</span><span class="font3"> after a to!/ hfcte way has been paid for, is there positive assurance, or any assurance, that the toll will be removed or even reduced?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the average driver, sanguine and buoyed up at the prospect of rubbing tires on a luxurious new highway, greets the toll road with an exclamation of “bravo”. Only when he analyzes the toll in the light of all the other auto taxes he is paying does he realize the toll way is not an inexpensive way. Indeed, surprise encounters with tollgates, after the novelty of steering in between a battery of colorful toll booths has worn off, can toss a monkey wrench into one’s mental composure and budget plans. Already the average American family earning under $4,000 and that has a mediuni-sizec? car is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shelling out more for </span><span class="font3">auto and gas taxes than for income taxes! Will the motorist of the toll highway era have to ransack the nursery money box every time he wants to stream down a snooth highway? Of course, one does not have to take the toll road, but since it usually offers the most enticing route, who can resist it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A few states have demonstrated what can be done without the tollgate. For Instance, Texas huilt the Gulf Freeway stretching 50 miles from Houston to Galveston. Product of federal and state funds, it is said to be the longest toll-free superhighway built in the United States since the end of World War II. The chairman of the Texas Highway commission has voiced the view that the state should avoid (oils on its highways and has </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">declared that. </span><span class="font3">the Gulf Freeway would continue to be free even if made a link In a toll highway system. That there will he at least one '•free” link in a proposed four-state toll highway system is heart-cheering!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bridge and Tunnel Toll</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But tollgates are not confined to roads. Sta tes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and eommissivns use</span><span class="font3"> the toll method to finance bridges and tunnels, which structures the public hopefully expects will become toll-free when construction costs have been met. Yet what so frequently happens? When the structure is paid for, the toll is not lifted, rarely reduced. The Holland tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey originally cost $48,400,000; its gross revenue row is over $180,000,000, but its tollgates still collect the original toll of 50 cents. Of course, few are adverse to this when revenue is used to finance new bridges and tunnels, but how often toll money is used for nonhighway projects! For some time there has been a war against the toll collected on two bridges in New York, the Cross Bay and Marine Parkway bridges, where construction cost has long been met. Each year the structures cam a fabulous sum. Of the 1952 gross income of $29,000,-000, the pure profit was $20,000,000. And what win happen to this tidy sum? Another</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bridge or tunnel? No! the profit is slated to be used to finance tolls for an airline terminal and a proposed coliseum estimated to cost $18,000,000! So the poor motorist finds that not only his gasoline tax money but also his toll money is sometimes diverted to nonhighway construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This policy of forcing the motorist to finance everything from oyster propagation and mosquito control to coliseum building is equivalent to charging a bus rider a toll of 50 cents per ride because a new airfield needs to be built! Naturally the bus rider argues that he does not use the airfield, so why should he have to pay for it. The motorist feels the same way; he does not violently object to paying for something he uses, but to have to pay for projects that may be as foreign to him as the love life of a dinosaur is beyond reason!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And it would indeed be a cause for wonderment if, out of the millions of dollars in tolls collected annually, no greedy palms were greased with the eye-soothing color of greenbacks. Since political life has been so replete with corruption, toll money is a plum not to be overlooked by unscrupulous, political, not-so-little Jack Horners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the problem of adequate roads and bridges without exploitation of the public is not limited to the United States; th a whole world is in the same sad shape and is torn by hatred and dishonesty. Tollgates will not resolve this world’s ills or its road problems. Only the kingdom of Almighty God Jehovah will bring complete relief for beleaguered, victimized mankind. One cannot imagine tollgates in the new world, the very foundation of which is righteousness. (2 Peter 3.* 13) The highway to everlasting life in a new world is now open. It is a free way and leads to Jehovah’s free world.—Revelation 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So the next time you drive your car down a turnpike and discern that disconcerting sign, “Stop, Pay Toll,” you will understand it is only another sign of the deterioration of this world’s system of things. And, incidentally, the next time you dig deep into your pocket (or look empty-handedly at a fellow passenger) to pacify the relentlessly outstretched hand of a tollkeeper, it may be consoling to know that you probably know more about tollgates than the tollkeeper himself—especially if you remember the first recorded instance of a toll collection: on the great Persian military road from Babylon to Syria about 2000 B.C. Now, 3,953 years later, the tollgate is back to haunt you!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Taxes on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a Grand Scale</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">C.It is an old American custom to complain about taxes, but few citizens realize just what they do have to complain about! For example, the man who makes $86.50 a week thinks $455 a year in direct taxes is bad, but under the surface he pays $1,039 more. If his yearly income is $7,500 he pays $869 on his tax form and $1,932 in unseen taxes. Some prices are listed at a certain amount, plus tax, but this is deceitful because only the final tax is listed. There are 200 different taxes on every car, 475 on a new house, 116 on a man's suit. Taxes amount to 14c out of a 26c gallon of gas, $15 out of a $24 ton of coal. Why such taxes? Government spending, of course! In the 144 years preceding 1933 the government spent $110,974 million. In just a twelfth that time, or the years from 1933-1945, it spent three times as much, $355,930 million. Then, In just over half that time, during the seven years Truman was president, it spent another three times the amount it had in all history prior to 1933, or $347,376 million. The old American custom is being practiced as never before, and government spending is on such a grand scale that the new administration finds it difficult to do anything about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Praying for Rulers and Kings</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">S IT proper to pray for kings and rulers of this world? For judges before whom the Christian minister is brought to bear witness? For oppressive, intolerant dictators in whose land the witness work suffers? Before reaching any hasty conclusions, suppose we consult the Sacred Record and see what it has to say on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is true the Bible nowhere commands us to pray for the conversion of the world, Jesus very specifically stated: &quot;I make request, not concerning the world, but concerning those you have given me [his apostles],... because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world.” (John 17:9,14, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,) </span><span class="font0">His prayers were for his apostles and disciples. On one occasion he said to Peter: &quot;Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have you men to sift you as wheat. But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, when once you have returned, give support to your brothers.” (Luke 22:31, 32, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font0"> But we do not read of such prayers in behalf of Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, or of Herod the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The apostles and disciples of Christ followed him very closely in this matter of prayer. Their prayers were for their brothers in Christ. As Paul wrote: “That is also why we, from the day we heard of it, have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work.” (Colossians 1:9-12, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font0"> These prayers were for the dedicated servant of God and for the various reasons that Paul lists. Then, are we to conclude from this that it is wrong to pray for kings and rulers? No. Paul states that “supplications, prayers, intercessions, offerings of thanks, be made concerning all kinds of men, concerning kings and all those who are in high station, in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness. This is right and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God, whose will is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”. (1 Timothy 2:1-4, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> These kings and others in high station made reference to in the text are none other than rulers of the worldly nations and others highly placed in public affairs. What kind of prayers would be offered for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus made plain that his followers would “be haled before governors and kings for my sake for the purpose of a witness to them and the nations”. (Matthew 10:18, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> When before these rulers the Christian would pray, and often the entire congregation of God would join in prayer. These prayers would concern the official before whom the Christian was to appear. His prayers and the prayers of the congregation of God might be to the effect that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God, will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian’s cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scriptural Examples</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prayers with regard to government officials in that sense or with that purpose in view are Scripturally exemplified also. When Queen Esther appeared unbidden before the Persian king Xerxes,, she placed her life in jeopardy. Before making her appearance, both she and Mordecai fasted for three days, and such fasting was always accompanied by prayers and supplications, which means they would ask God to make the king view Esther with favor, for that was the point on which her safety hinged. The intercessions were successful.—Esther 4:16; 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Again, when Nehemiah had to present a cause involving Jehovah’s worship before the Persian king he fasted and prayed. His prayer was: “Let thy servant have success at this time, let him find favour in the sight of this man!” The man was the king. It is quite evident that Nehemiah prayed for God to shape the king’s decision, and God answered that prayer.—Nehemiah 1:4,11; 2:4, 5, 8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And consider Paul’s expression before King Agrippa, when a weighty question involving Paul's preaching was up for decision: “Agrippa said to Paul: Tn a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.' At this Paul said: T could wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I also am, with the exception of these bonds.’&quot; (Acts 26:28-32, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> These words of Paul concerning these rulers, if not a regular prayer, were in the nature of supplication or intercession, for they constituted a “wish to God&quot;. Paul did not pray for their conversion and no conversion followed, but their decision was favorable to Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On other occasions the early Christians prayed concerning rulers. (Acts 4:23-31) They did this that the work of preaching might prosper. Moreover, prayers that concerned rulers might also be viewed as on their behalf, in the sense that if they conformed to the petitions they would be in a better position with God, a better administration would follow, resulting in good for all kinds of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some in high stations have come into the truth, but we. do not pray for that. We pray for opportunity to preach to all of the Lord’s other sheep, and if rulers are among them we are glad. Nor do we pray for the political schemes of the rulers, or for the world of which they are a part. James warns us not to make friends with the old world. (James 4:4) Our prayers must not take on any political tone or color, because as Christians we are neutral with regard to the affairs of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So our prayers will not be for the conversion of this old world, or for the conversion of governmental bodies or individual officials; rather we will pray to God that-if it pleases him to direct rulers and judges to see clearly the issues relative to his people, may he do so for the work’s sake. We may pray concerning court cases, bans, persecutions behind “iron curtains”, and other instances where the preaching work is involved, and this prayer will also concern the officials involved in the case, and if they react justly it will be to their advantage. God will certainly accomplish his work and bless his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So it is in the interest of saving all kinds of men that we pray concerning rulers and others in high office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">OllTH of the Belgian Congo In British South Africa lies the land of Northern Rhodesia. A little larger than the state of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Texas and having a population of 1,700,000 Africans and 32,000 Europeans. Northern Rhodesia has been the center of a great deal of activity by Jehovah’s witnesses during the past seven years. In 1946 there were only 4,798 witnesses of Jehovah, hut in 1952, 20,282 witnesses were engaged in telling others about God’s kingdom. That is one wiliiesa for about every 85 of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, compared with other lands, the percentage of Qiose actively interested in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Northern Rhodesia is very high. Five villages fire almost exclusively made up of ministers and persons of good will. The headman of the village may be a regular witness or he may be the overseer of the congregation uf Jehuvah's. witnesses. In such villages are to be seen neat little Kingdom Halls, meeting places of Jehovah's witnesses, as the center of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses in Northern Rhodesia present no tax-coll eating problems for the government. Quite often the taxes are collected and handed to the collecting official without his asking. In the Solwrzi district the chief called at the Kingdom Hall; he listened to the Bible study and then asked how many had paid their taxes. Without an exception all had. He then called in the tax offenders and compared them unfavorably with the witnesses and urged them to follow the good example these had set. More important, he urged the enlargement of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But this appreciation is not the monoply of the Africans. A while back a farmer threatened to beat some witnesses who were witnessing and conducting Bible studies on his farm and he phoned the police concerning their activity. He was told that he was an unwise mon, as he was trying to get rid of the best Africans in the country. With good sense he permitted them to continue and the results were beneficial. His suggestion to a neighbor that the witnesses start Bible studies on his farm was gladly accepted and acted upon. Prejudice is breaking down!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And why should it not? Nnte some of the superstitious practices that these Africans leave behind when they become Jehovah’s witnesses. In some places when a man dies his brothers are not allowed to wash for three months. In other places at death the entire community sits up all night beating drums and moaning to drive away evil spirits. In yet another area, if the headman of the village dies, the villagers will all move away, leaving their homes and gardens for fear the spirit of the dead headman will come back to trouble them. Another superstition requires that certain medicine be placed on the upper lip of a newborn child so that the top teeth will come through first. If the lower teeth come through first there is danger of the baby’s becoming a crocodile J</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are also working hard to combat illiteracy, which runs very high in Northern Rhodesia. To this end the Watch Tower Society has provided classes and more than 1,500 teachers are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">instructing others to read and write, some of whom have themselves risen from the ranks of the illiterate to take their places among the qualified instructors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, one can see that God’s way is being considered in Northern Rhodesia as never before. More and more people are realizing that God’s way is the only way to peace and happiness now and in the future. This fact was demonstrated by the conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses held there December 26 to 28, 1952. The occasion of the conventions was the visit of the president of the Watch Tower Society, N. H. Knorr, who was calling to see how the work was progressing in this far-off land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Northern Rhodesia one cannot hire a Madison Square Garden or a Yankee Stadium for a convention; such accommodations must be built to meet particular needs. So a seating arena was built of bamboo benches seating over 18,000, set out with dividing aisles, ii&gt;the form Qf a large semicircle facing the speaker’s platform. The platform itself was constructed by leveling off a large abandoned anthill and erecting a grass-roofed shelter as protection from sun and rain. Anthills in this part of Africa are often from ten to fifteen feet high and from twenty to thirty feet in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To house the brothers 17 thatched-roof shelters were constructed, some of which were 700 feet in length. By arranging for a second “layer” in three of these it was possible to accommodate 8,004 people at the camp site. Needless to say, such a vast construction project involved a great deal of work and material. But all felt well rewarded when the assembly came around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The very sight of the assembly, situated in such beautiful surroundings, was enough to impress one. But the most vivid impression was made by the singing. Led by a chorus of 1,010, the singing at this assembly was something that sent chills up the spine and even brought tears to one’s eyes. It was beautiful. No musical instruments were in evidence. At the signal from the conductor the throng raised their voices in song and what seemed to be complicated part-singing harmony was executed with complete ease. The harmony was exquisite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The assembly opened Friday, December 26, with almost 14,000 in attendance. On that day 1,195 were baptized. By the time the public meeting came around Sunday afternoon, 20,000 people had packed out the seating arena and overflowed into some of the shelters or had located themselves on vantage points on nearby anthills. Due to the kind assistance of a local European, the sound system was well-nigh perfect and the huge crowd heard every word of the public lecture, **It Is Time to Consider God’s Way.” Some 8,000 witnesses attended another assembly held in the Northern Province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The picture of the work in Northern Rhodesia would not be complete, however, without some reference to the opposition experienced by Jehovah’s witnesses in that land. It varies from a violent diatribe against the witnesses in the form of a Cjbemba booklet, published by the so-called “White Fathers”, blaming most of the former disturbances of the country, from personal illnesses to drought, on the witnesses of Jehovah, to the mission leaders<sup>1 </sup>sporadic inciting of their flocks to oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses with physical violence. Warning of legal action caused one such inciter to violence to desist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">True to Jehovah’s promise, none of the weapons formed against his people are prospering. (Isaiah 54:17) On the contrary, the work of his servants is moving forward in Northern Rhodesia as well as in other parts of the earth and an ever-increasing crowd of men of good will are taking a stand for clean worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Friction on the Peace Front </span><span class="font3">$&gt; While the peace drive was on, friction suddenly developed among the Allies, mostly between London and Washing* ton. Sir Winston wanted high-level talks between the leading powers. President Eisenhower wanted evidence of Soviet good faith first. Then from both sides of the Atlantic came a barrage of recriminations. While Clement Attlee and Senator McCarthy exchanged verbal blows, others tried to patch up Anglo-American relations. Said Britain's Minister of State Lloyd: &quot;If we [Britain and the U. S.’J are forced apart, there is no danger which may not befall us.” Said Senator Smith of New Jersey: “I can imagine nothing more pleasing to the Kremlin than the present battle of words between Westminster and Washington/’ Meanwhile the Korean truce talks were at a critical stage.

<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Building the Suez Canal zone, one of the largest and best-equipped military bases in the world, took the British 38 years and cost $1,500,000,000. Egypt has demanded that Britain give it all Up by unconditionally evacuating her 80,000 troops, Britain does not want to turn, the canal over to Egypt until she first has assurance for its safety and functioning efficiency. After deadlocked negotiations between Britain and Egypt were suspended (5/6), General Naguib warned that Egypt would gain its objective in the impending &quot;big battle”. Said Naguib (5/10): “We have washed our hands of talks, . , , We will pay [for Independence] with the hot blood of [ourl sons.” Said Prime Minister Churchill: &quot;If our troops in the Canal zone were to be the ohject of . . , attack * . . we should have no choice but to defend ourselves/’ To help resolve the ticklish situation U. S. Secretary of State Dulles visited Cairo (5/13) to talk with General Naguib. It was declared (5/16) that Egypt would not reopen negotiations until Britain gave evidence that she had abandoned &quot;imperialistic motives”, but that “no drastic moves” would be made until Dulles returned to the U, S, and presented his formula for solution of the deadlock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">De Gaulle Exits from Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; General Charles De Gaulle never felt at home in politics, calling it a 'sterile game’. So unproductive did the “game” seem to De Gaulle that he announced (5/6) he was taking his party, the Rally of the French People, out of politics. Henceforth it will put up no candidates at elections and members will act “in their individual capacity ... in the games, the poisons and delights of the system”. However, De Gaufle said that his party will continue Its mission to unite the French people and to “change the bad regime”, the political system by which squabbling selfish parties produce instability, disorder and lethargy in public affairs. He also spoke of the “confusion of the rulers”. But the best political leaders in the “sterile gpmes of politics” have never been able to deliver the people completely from “bad regimes”. Thus there is today “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out”. Yet Jesus said that when you see this, &quot;raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up/’ (Luke 21:25, 28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World </span><span class="font3">Trans.) Why? Because it means God’s kingdom will soon bring complete deliverance from bad regimes by bringing in a government of righteousness.—2 Peter 3:13,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In April, 1951, William Oatis, Associated Press correspondent in Prague, was arrested by the Czechoslovak government and later sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment because of, as the prosecution put it, “his insistence on obtaining only accurate, correct, verified information.” The U. S. considered his imprisonment a “gross injustice” and imposed trade sanctions against Czechoslovakia, After two years in prison, Oatis was pardoned by President Zapotocky (5/15), the Czech radio saying that the pardon was granted because of a letter by Oatis’ wife to Czechoslovakia's president. The U. S., pleased at Oatis’ release, announced it would consider lifting commercial and diplomatic sanctions against Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Improvement in Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;Q&gt;</span><span class="font3"> The British struggle against 5,000 Communist guerrillas in Malaya has been waged at a high cost: $250,000,000. Still the war continues, but with some improvement for the British. A report released by Landon’s commissioner of police, who served in Malaya, disclosed that tin and rubber production Is now only little affected by guerrilla maraudings. A crippling blow against the Reds was the arrival of helicopters, which are able to supply jungle forts in a matter of minutes. One fort that had been four days’ march on foot from the edge of the jungle is now reached by helicopter in ten minutes. Red terrorists, formerly safe in the jungle, are now harried even deep in their wild haunts. The result has been a decrease in Communist numbers, which, for the flrst time in years, dropped below 5,000. Despite improvement, the war continued with more than 40,000 troops and almost 75,000 police plus auxiliary forces still tied down in a never-ending fight against the now fewer than 5,000 Red terrorists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Devaluation in Indo-China</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the moves made by France (5/10) to reinforce its war effort in Indo-China was the devaluation of the Indo-Chinese piaster. The former value of the piaster was 17 franca (4.9 cents), but now it ia worth only 10 francs. Before devaluation, speculators were buying piasters on the black market for 8 francs and then turning them in at the official rate of 17 francs. This profiteering cost the French government an estimated $250,000,000 annually. Now profiteering is disappearing but inflation is appearing. Some stores have raised their prices by 100 to 200 per cent. Hence observers believe deterioration in French-IndoChinese relations as a result of inflation will overweigh any good effected by devaluation.</span></p>

Romulo resigned (5/14) as Philippine Ambassador to the U. S.<sub>}</sub> to seek the nomination for the Philippine presidency on the Liberal Party ticket, the political contest took on new interest. For Romulo to win the nomination he would have to defeat President Quirino in the convention, or else the president would have to withdraw voluntarily, “I am not withdrawing. I am running for re-election,” said the president. So General Romulo has two battles on his hands: He must overcome Quirino and after that he must win the election from Mr. Magsaysay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; In all the history of the Union of South Africa there has never been a break in the white ruling bloc, in the sense that it has unitedly opposed extension of political rights to non whites and advocated racial segregation. That is, there was no break until May when it was announced that two new parties were being formed: The Federal Union party, which urges better conditions, and the Liberal party, which asks for full rights for Africans. The Liberal party, set up by Alan Paton, author of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cry the Beloved Country,</span><span class="font3"> advocates full citizenship rights for all civilized people regardless of race, color or creed. Meantime, Prime Minister Daniel Malan’s Nationalist party was delighted about the new turn of events, as the Nationalists hope that more whites will now be driven into their extreme right-wing camp.</span></p>

But in May police arrested two wealthy conservatives opposed to Perdn’s regime. The men had tried to blow up a government Cadillac and were caught red-handed. The captives soon implicated other Buenos Aires socialites, and police finally rounded up about 225 important Argentine citizens.

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Qnahe Jan Central Chile</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Chile had an earthquake (5/6) that was not satisfied In playing havoc with just one city. Striking the cities of Concepcion, Los Angeles, An cud, Temuco, Talcahuano, and Chilian, the ugly earth tremors took an aggregate toll of 9 lives and left 22 injured, besides toppling many old buildings. Chilian was almost completely wiped out by an earthquake in 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Murderous Tornadoes in U. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Those violently destructive whirlwinds moving forward as a whirling funnel and called tornadoes were responsible for the savage killing of more than 100 persons (5/11) in Waco and San Angelo, Texas. Buildings folded up like accordions. In Waco a brick 5-story building housing one of the city's largest furniture stores collapsed into a worthless pile of rubble. Total tornado damage was estimated at close to $30,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Border-Jumpers Set Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; When the U. S. Immigration Sendee announced that a total of 07,416 border-jumpers were caught in April trying to enter the U. S. from Mexico, it meant a record-breaking two a minute, day and night! Called “wetbacks”, because they usually swim or wade the Rio Grande, the name ironically did not seem to fit, because a drought reduced much of the river to a trickle. The drought, impoverishing farmers in northern areas of Mexico, and rising unemployment have helped send the deluge of wetbacks across the U. S. border in hope of obtaining seasonal farm work. Though technically liable to a 2-year prison sentence, the wetbacks are usually just hauled back across the border. This flood of Mexican job-seokcrs, which often arouses bitter anti-American feelings in Mexico, prompted the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font3"> (5/4) to report drolly: &quot;Officers of the United States Immigration Service admit candidly, if unofficially, that there' is nothing to stop the whole nation of Mexico moving Into the United States if it wants to.&quot; Since 1945 the numerical equivalent of more than 10 per eent of Mexico’s population has tried to come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Soviet Films Lack Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A young</span><span class="font3"> woman student at Moscow’s Government Motion Picture Institute charged (5/6) that Soviet films underestimate the power of love. She ridiculed the films that have handsome heroes and ravishing heroines saying: &quot;If you fulfill the norm by 100 per cent, I shall love you.” The student told Soviet writers that love has not disappeared from life, so &quot;you can’t replace the theme of love with the theme of industrial production”. Maybe the Soviet script writers need a few lessons from Hollywood!</span></p>

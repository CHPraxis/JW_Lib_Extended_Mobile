The Bible
● It is the best seller of all time. It is the book of the month every month of the year, every year of the calendar. It is perennially modern, never outdated, and whatever the price, it is priceless, for it has brought solace to the sick, comfort to the sorrowing, spiritual strength to the strong. It has given hope to the poor, humility to the proud. It has touched the hearts of king and commoner. It was written for all people of all nations of all time. It points the way to spiritual wealth that never can be taxed and to spiritual dividends that never will be passed. It is the dispenser of life to those who follow its counsel; it is the unfailing beacon to guide men into that new world of righteousness where there will be no tears, disappointment or death. It is the textbook of freedom, the guidebook of life. Let us study its teachings, follow its counsel, and live; for ‘this means everlasting life, to know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent forth, Jesus Christ’.

A Foretaste of New-World Unity
CHRISTIANS of the first century were identified by their bond of love and their unity. Christendom, on the other hand, is identified by its many divisions of religions and confused politics. The only semblance of unity that she possesses originates, not out of the bond of love for one another, but out of fear of one another. Jesus commanded his followers to “love one another”.—John 13:34, NW.
This same spirit of love for one another and for truth still permeates twentieth-century Christians. Accurate knowledge caused early Christians to eliminate from among themselves old-world disunities, as Paul stated: Put on “the new personality . . . where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all”. (Col. 3:9-11, NW) So, too, witnesses of Jehovah today are not disunited by the old world’s national traditions, pride, rivalries, political differences and social standing. Their assemblies prove this true. The peace, harmony and brotherly affection that Jehovah’s witnesses have for one another have always been a source of amazement to the oldworld “stabilizers”. It was outstandingly so at the 1950 international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium in New York city.
The contrast of divided Christendom and united Jehovah’s witnesses, we agree, is great. Perhaps greater than day and night, because it is the difference between old-world and new-world living. Eight full days of new-world unity and living has been a means of bringing many to an accurate knowledge of truth. Once again we have this opportunity extended to us, at the Yankee Stadium July 19-26, 1953. Do not miss it!

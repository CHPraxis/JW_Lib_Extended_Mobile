<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “It is not really enough,” said the London <em>Catholic Herald, </em>February 5, “to refute the accusation that Catholics are not allowed to read the Bible with the retort that they are allowed and encouraged to do so. The refutation will only be effective when Catholics do read and love the Bible and show the fact in the habit of their minds, the turn of their language and, above all, in that inner appreciation of doctrine and the spiritual life which grows best when fed on the Bible.” There is a challenge! No one will believe Catholics are really encouraged to read the Bible until they do read it. It may not always please them, however, for diligent study will prove that today’s religions have added to true doctrine as thoroughly as did the Pharisees of old. Nevertheless, its value is in providing a release from ensnarement, the exposure of blind guides and the sure test for true doctrine.</p>

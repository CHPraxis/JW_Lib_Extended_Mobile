<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God’s great love moved him to provide for the establishment of a Kingdom. He described in his Word in advance what would occur relative to the coming of this kingdom and how some from among humankind might gain everlasting life under it. (Ps. 144:20, <em>Dy</em>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:20-19:145:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 145:20</a> Making known that Word is the privilege of every person who desires God’s favor. During May Jehovah’s witnesses will present booklets containing information relative to God’s loving provisions. Offer 10 booklets for 15c; 5 booklets for 10c; or 2 booklets for 5c. You are invited to share in this booklet distribution. Write the Society for details and we will put you in touch with the nearest congregation of witnesses.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Following the world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium, New York, July 19 to 26, a 96-page report with a two-color cover will be published setting out many of the high lights and details. If you are unable to attend this assembly, you will want to be sure to receive a copy of this report. If you do attend, you will be able to review the wonderful happenings by perusing this report. Complete with a generous sprinkling of pictures, the report will be splendid for all good-will persons with whom you study. Where possible, all of Jehovah’s witnesses are encouraged to place their orders now through the local congregation. However, individuals may place their orders direct if they wish. Get some extra copies to place at your Bible study calls. Specify clearly the number of copies of the 1953 world assembly report you want, and enclose a remittance of 25 cents per copy to cover costs. Type or print your address plainly; and if your address should change between now and October 1, please be sure to advise us.</p>

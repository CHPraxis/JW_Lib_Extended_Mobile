Through the Snow to Learn the Bible
● In a section of Oregon that was snowed under for two months a young couple wanted so much to learn the Bible that they came as far as they could in their automobile and then walked the rest of the way to the home of Jehovah’s witnesses, who are helping them to learn about God. Bill, the husband, put his packsack on his back with all their study books and Bibles in it. Then he put their little year-and-a-half-old boy on the top of the packsack on his shoulders, and they trudged through the snow.
On one occasion Bill found a neighbor whom he had known for some time at the Witnesses’ home. Bill said to him: “You know, if you or anyone had told me a few months back that I would walk this far to have a Bible study, I would have said you were out of your mind!”

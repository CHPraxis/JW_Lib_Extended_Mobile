<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● When a man began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, his minister came by his home to pay him a visit. The minister said to the man: “I heard some bad news about you. I understand that you have gone over to Jehovah’s witnesses.” The man replied: “Let me tell you one thing; it might be bad news to <em>you, </em>but it is <em>good </em>news to me. All the years that I have been in church I have not learned a thing. But Jehovah’s witnesses have taught me the Bible’s truth and I am glad I can bring it to others.” The clergyman departed immediately.</p>

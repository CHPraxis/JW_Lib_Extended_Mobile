<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● According to <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>Candlemas, which falls on February 2, is a day set aside to honor the purification of the Virgin Mary. It is to recall Mary’s obeying God’s law by going to the temple in Jerusalem and offering a sacrifice of purification after she bore Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:21-42:2:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 2:21-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:1-3:12:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Lev. 12:1-4</a>) How strange! The Catholic church teaches that Mary was sinless when she conceived Jesus, yet sets aside a day to honor her performance of an act that proves that she was not sinless but was imperfect, as are all the descendants of Adam.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">‚óè The snorkel and the periscope are by no means modern inventions by man. A bird, designed by the Creator, had them first. When the pied-billed grebe, a North American water bird, suspects that danger is lurking near, he will sink beneath the surface of the water, swim away to a safer area and then stick the tip of his beak out of the water, snorkel-fashion, for air. Eventually, when he decides to check if the danger is past, like a periscope he brings his head up just enough for an eye to survey the situation.</p>

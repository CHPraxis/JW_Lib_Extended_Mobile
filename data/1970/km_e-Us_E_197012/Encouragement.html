<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We are all indebted to Jehovah for the great encouragement he continues to give us as we serve him. Now the <em>Yearbook </em>is coming out and we will read in its pages a record of the tremendous blessing Jehovah gave to his people throughout the world in the past service year. During December you may find it possible to read quite a few pages of the <em>Yearbook </em>because of the holiday season or, perhaps, if there is severe weather. Take advantage of your moments at home to begin reading your <em>Yearbook. </em>Make note of the experiences that you find especially fitting for your situation or to encourage someone in your congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Maybe there are appropriate experiences that can be used to buoy up and encourage the interested ones, showing how others have had success in coming into harmony with Jehovah despite obstacles. Worldliness has been overcome, demonism has been defeated, marriage problems have been solved​—yes, the <em>Yearbook </em><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>is a very fine encouragement to follow right principles and gain victories. It is being printed in English, French, German and Spanish.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Now is the time to make plans for your family to consider the experiences from each country in the <em>Yearbook. </em>Some will have the reading each day in connection with the daily text and comments. Others may choose another time for this special event. The best way is to make a plan and stick to it so nothing is missed from this source of Christian encouragement.</p>

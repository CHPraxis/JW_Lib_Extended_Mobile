Whether people receive the Kingdom message graciously or not, we bring praise to Jehovah by calling at their homes and telling them why we are there. Strive to be a qualified teacher. Success in ministry should not be judged by the amount of literature placed. The joy of the ministry is in finding a hearing ear.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Suggested Presentation for “Watchtower” Campaign. Discussion followed by demonstration. “Watchtower” issues for January through April will include articles emphasizing the theme “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.” Many fine talking points will be found in these articles. The purpose of the following sermon is to draw attention to the fact that only God’s kingdom will be able to solve man’s problems. People need to see the difference between God’s kingdom and what it will do and earthly governments, which most sincere people realize are not able to accomplish their full aims. More persons today than ever before have definite ideas about what a government should do, so it would be good to let them express themselves. At the outset, reason with the householder. Try to involve him in a conversation. A few timely, well-thought-out questions will help to arouse the householder’s thinking and interest. See if he will mention a problem that is his concern. What does he think is the solution to the problem? Does he believe new laws are the answer? Does he think new officials would be able to make people love one another and love what is right? Listen to his opinion, but instead of trying to draw an immediate solution to the problem in question, explain that human leaders and officials have been trying in vain to solve this as well as most of mankind’s woes. However, there is one government that will succeed. Then draw his attention to the Bible’s explanation of what this government will do.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>Theme: The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.</strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn">“Hello. My name is ​———. Today the people are confronted with many problems in life​—illness, pollution, trouble in the schools, insecurity, wars and violence are some of them. What do you think can be done to solve these problems? Do you think that new laws are the answer? What do you feel is the greatest problem? [Allow the householder time to give his opinion and acknowledge that many governmental leaders work hard to find solutions, but with little lasting success.] Do you realize that there is one government that has the answer and will not fail in carrying out the solution? It will not be government by men. The Scriptures identify this government, calling it God’s kingdom. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a> indicates coming of God’s kingdom will cause God’s will to be done here on earth. [Not necessary to read this text.] [Here use one of the following texts that best fits the problem under consideration. The first could be applied to illness or pollution. The second, to oppression or injustice. The third, to lawlessness or violence, etc.]</p>

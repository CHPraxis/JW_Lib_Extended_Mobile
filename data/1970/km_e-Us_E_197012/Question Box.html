<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Are all dedicated males in the congregation qualified to give public talks?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Qualifications for public speakers are mentioned on pages 150 to 152 of the “Lamp” book. Not all dedicated men have these qualifications, but many can develop them over a period of time by regular participation in the Theocratic Ministry School. Additionally, age is a factor. One who teaches in this way in the congregation ought not to be person newly dedicated, but one experienced in handling the Word. Therefore 18 years is recommended as a reasonable minimum age for public speakers; however, an exception might be considered when a young brother is an appointed servant in a congregation where there are insufficient older brothers available to give talks, if the congregation committee finds that he meets the qualifications set forth in the “Lamp” book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If at one time a person had been disfellowshiped or disassociated, may he ever give a public talk? This might occur, but only after <strong>at least </strong>ten years from reinstatement.

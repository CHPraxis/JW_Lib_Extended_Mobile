Question Box
Are all dedicated males in the congregation qualified to give public talks?
Qualifications for public speakers are mentioned on pages 150 to 152 of the “Lamp” book. Not all dedicated men have these qualifications, but many can develop them over a period of time by regular participation in the Theocratic Ministry School. Additionally, age is a factor. One who teaches in this way in the congregation ought not to be person newly dedicated, but one experienced in handling the Word. Therefore 18 years is recommended as a reasonable minimum age for public speakers; however, an exception might be considered when a young brother is an appointed servant in a congregation where there are insufficient older brothers available to give talks, if the congregation committee finds that he meets the qualifications set forth in the “Lamp” book.
If at one time a person had been disfellowshiped or disassociated, may he ever give a public talk? This might occur, but only after at least ten years from reinstatement. (For details see “The Watchtower,” 8/15/65, p. 497; “Lamp,” p. 121.)

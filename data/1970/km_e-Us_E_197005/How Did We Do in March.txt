How Did We Do in March?
What a fine month March proved to be! With a total of 374,878 publishers and pioneers in the field preaching, we have reached our third peak in proclaimers of the good news so far this service year. This is an increase of 8.7Â percent over last March. Regular pioneers are now at the highest level that they have ever been, and vacation pioneers are more than double the number reporting last March.
Particularly is it noteworthy that we reached 6 back-calls per publisher. Evidently many more are reaching out for the opportunity to conduct a Bible study. What will be the results in April? We all wait anxiously to see!

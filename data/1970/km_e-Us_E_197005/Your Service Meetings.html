He recognizes that rider on white horse represents Christ Jesus. Calendar in background shows the time is October 1914. A sword, he acknowledges, represents war, which was raging at that time on an unprecedented scale. If food items were so short they had to be weighed out, what would this represent? Yes, food shortage or famine conditions. The next rider is readily recognized as symbolizing death. The coming of all of these from and after 1914 gives proof that we have entered the “time of the end.” Interested one is fascinated by this discussion.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: Again have privilege of offering “New World Translation” and “Word of God” book. What a fine combination this proved to be when offered in December! Publishers may use any method in presenting offer, but following presentation or variation may be helpful.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">(6 min.) (After greeting and giving name) “I’m making brief visits on my neighbors to show them one of the most popular and helpful Bible translations published today. [Show Bible.] Most people tell us, when we show them this Bible, that they already have a Bible. Likely you do, too. [Let householder answer.] We are not here as Bible salesmen, to sell you just another Bible, but we would like you to obtain this modern up-to-date translation and this Bible-study aid that goes with it. The two go together so you will have the means in your home to understand the Bible. Both are only $1.25.”</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Even before householder replies to offer, publisher could continue at this point, inquiring sincerely, “Do you find sometimes, in reading the Bible, questions come to mind? [Likely the answer will be Yes.] In fact, some wonder if the Bible is really the Word of God. Possibly you have heard statements made by prominent clergymen, casting doubt on the Bible. [Allow for response.] But here is where this book will be of much help. Here is proof positive that the Bible is really the Word of God. It will help you see from the Bible that God has not forgotten mankind upon the earth and how you (and your family) can share in the wonderful future he has promised. This modern-language Bible and the book can be yours.” (Extend to householder.)</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">(6 min.) The above presentation could be varied according to what you find best in your territory. After same opening, and proceeding to point where mention is made that some clergymen are doubting the Bible, you could say: “Did you know the same was true in Jesus’ day? [Allow for response.] Looking here in the concordance of the ‘New World Translation’ under ‘Word of God’ we find the first reference takes up what Jesus said about some of the religious leaders of his day. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:13-41:7:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 7:13</a>.] Just a few verses earlier he said . . . [read vss. 7, 8]. But how should the Bible be viewed? Jesus, in praying to God in behalf of his followers, said . . . [read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>]. The Bible, then, contains the words of truth. Moreover, its words are life-giving, since it points the way to everlasting life. We invite you to accept the ‘New World Translation,’ which we have been reading from and this companion Bible-study aid.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman concludes encouraging all to prepare well and buy out the time to share regularly in the house-to-house work with the offer.</p>

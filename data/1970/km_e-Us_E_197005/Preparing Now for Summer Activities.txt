Preparing Now for Summer Activities
1 With the coming of May, summer is only a few weeks away. Are you starting to plan your summer activities now with the thought of sharing fully in theocratic activities? For the young folks, school will be out in June, and this leaves two or three months for vacation pioneering. Vacations for most come at this time of the year too. In addition to attending one of the district assemblies during your vacation, can you serve as a vacation pioneer for a month or at least two weeks? What more exciting and beneficial way could you find for spending your vacation? And this would not have to cut out an occasional visit to the beach or other relaxation either. If care is not exercised, however, the whole summer can go by with activities supposedly for our own personal enjoyment being put first and with only a token amount of time being spent in the ministry, which is far more important and really brings us the greatest joy. It takes planning now to be sure that the summer will be well used.
2 Some congregations will be caring, for isolated territory. Others will be making a concerted effort to cover their regular territory thoroughly, especially those areas not reached during the winter and spring months. Plans should be carefully laid now for reaching those who have not heard the Kingdom message recently.
3 Here is a special privilege for some: Regular pioneers who have their own partners and who desire to serve as special pioneers temporarily in isolated territory this summer, putting in 150 hours in field service, are invited to write to the Society for further information. Use of a serviceable car is essential. The Society will provide some financial assistance.

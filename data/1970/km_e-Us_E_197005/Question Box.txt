Question Box
● What should be posted on the congregation’s information board?
The information board makes it possible for publishers to acquaint themselves fully with details in letters, schedules and general communications regarding activities within or pertaining to the congregation, though some of these may be read to the congregation before posting.
Some of the things that may be posted on the information board are: service meeting program, ministry school schedule and assignments, schedule for cleaning the Kingdom Hall, letters from the Society that direct that they be posted, notice of the circuit servant’s visit and the schedule for publishers to work with the circuit servant, letters regarding the coming circuit assembly, monthly congregation field service report, schedules showing the public talks and the speakers for the coming months, assignments for those who will serve as chairman of the public lectures and the readers of “The Watchtower,” the congregation book studies in the congregation’s territory and the addresses and time of meetings, and so forth.
The information board is not to be used for personal items such as “shower” announcements. Clippings should not be indiscriminately posted, but from time to time some selected ones may be deemed by the overseer to be appropriate to be put on the board for a few days. The information board should be neat and attractive. The overseer has supervision of the information board, and he should see that it is kept up-to-date.

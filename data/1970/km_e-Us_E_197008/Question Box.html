<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Who may have a part on the service meeting?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Basically, any publisher in good standing with the congregation, including young children, may be used in some way on the service meeting. However, when it comes to putting a brother in charge of a service meeting part, the overseer is to assign only dedicated and baptized males who set a good example as Christians. (“Lamp” book, pp. 55, 182, 183) Where there is a shortage of brothers, sisters can assist. (“Lamp” book, pp. 154, 155).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is well to use a variety of publishers on the service meeting so that, if possible, the same ones are not on the program all the time. Some portion may be assigned to a book study servant and he may pick out various ones in his group to assist him, keeping in mind the using of others for future parts. Where there is a willingness to be used and fine cooperation with scheduled rehearsals of demonstrations, the meetings become very instructive and run smoothly.</p>

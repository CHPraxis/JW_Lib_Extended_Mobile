Question Box
● Who may have a part on the service meeting?
Basically, any publisher in good standing with the congregation, including young children, may be used in some way on the service meeting. However, when it comes to putting a brother in charge of a service meeting part, the overseer is to assign only dedicated and baptized males who set a good example as Christians. (“Lamp” book, pp. 55, 182, 183) Where there is a shortage of brothers, sisters can assist. (“Lamp” book, pp. 154, 155).
It is well to use a variety of publishers on the service meeting so that, if possible, the same ones are not on the program all the time. Some portion may be assigned to a book study servant and he may pick out various ones in his group to assist him, keeping in mind the using of others for future parts. Where there is a willingness to be used and fine cooperation with scheduled rehearsals of demonstrations, the meetings become very instructive and run smoothly.

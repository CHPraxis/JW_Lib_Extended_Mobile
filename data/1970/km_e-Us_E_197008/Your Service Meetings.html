Demonstrate ways “Evolution” book can be placed, particularly using illustrations. Some may use illustration on page four, commenting that thinking people are concerned about where we came from. The scientific and Scriptural answer can be found in the book. Page 118 has a diagram explaining the miracle of human birth, attesting to the wisdom of God. Point out this diagram and then show also the illustration on page 123, which indicates the complicated navigational aids that man needs to accomplish what birds do by instinct. If some do not believe in evolution or are not interested in the subject, then refer to the illustrations on pages 183 and 185 using portions of the scriptures on these pages (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Isaiah 65:21-23 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Psalm 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 29</a>) to show what God has promised.

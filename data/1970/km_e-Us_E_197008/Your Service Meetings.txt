(2 Tim. 3:16, 17; John 17:17) How does one “press on to maturity” as Hebrews 6:1 encourages Christians to do? (Eph. 3:16-18; Josh. 1:8; Phil. 1:9; Prov. 2:4, 5) What does Jehovah provide to help us to “press on to maturity?” (Spirit: 1 Cor. 2:10-13: Luke 11:13; Jas. 1:5, 6; Rom. 12:12.

20 min: Do You Remember? Audience discussion of articles from “Kingdom Ministry” in past year, September 1969 through August 1970. Chairman can handle this in a way that will cover matters most needed locally. Handle by subject, drawing out audience on specific points to be covered. He can give the audience the idea and let them complete it. One subject might be, “Starting and Conducting Studies.” (For information see “Kingdom Ministry” issues 9/69, p. 4; 10/69, p. 4; 11/69, pp. 2, 3; 2/70, pp. 1, 3; 3/70, p. 4; 4/70, p. 3; 5/70, p. 8; 6/70, p. 2; 7/70, p. 2; 8/70, p. 4) Those in audience can mention points that have helped them and relate brief experiences. Another subject could be vacation pioneering. (1/70 Insert, pp. 3-6; 5/70, p. 8; 6/70, p. 3; 8/70, p. 3)

20 min: Offering the “Evolution” book. Over two years since we have featured “Evolution” book as main offer from door to door. Children will be returning to school and can offer it to any teachers who did not receive it previously and to new classmates. Refer to the May 1968 “Kingdom Ministry” insert for suggestions. Demonstrate ways “Evolution” book can be placed, particularly using illustrations. Some may use illustration on page four, commenting that thinking people are concerned about where we came from. The scientific and Scriptural answer can be found in the book. Page 118 has a diagram explaining the miracle of human birth, attesting to the wisdom of God. Point out this diagram and then show also the illustration on page 123, which indicates the complicated navigational aids that man needs to accomplish what birds do by instinct. If some do not believe in evolution or are not interested in the subject, then refer to the illustrations on pages 183 and 185 using portions of the scriptures on these pages (Isaiah 11:6-9, Isaiah 65:21-23 and Psalm 37:10, 11, 29) to show what God has promised. Stress the positive promise of righteousness rather than wicked conditions that must be done away with.
Those giving a sermon to place the book may use whatever one they feel will best introduce the material locally.
 15 min: Concluding comments. Include also “Question Box,” with brother assigned to a service meeting part inquiring as to whom he may use to handle portion of it. Song 105.

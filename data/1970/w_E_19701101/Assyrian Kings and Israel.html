<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Various Assyrian kings, such as Shalmaneser and Sennacherib, were involved in military action against Israel, and the Bible records this information. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:9-12:18:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:9-16</a>) It is also interesting to note that many records of Assyrian kings from this general period of time have now been unearthed. These records mention at least eight of the Judean and Israelite kings that are named in the Bible, including Hezekiah, Ahaz, Manasseh, Omri, Jehu, Menahem, Pekah and Hoshea.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In Belgium a mother who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses was listening to a public Bible lecture with her child, about three years of age, sitting next to her. It seemed that he was not paying any attention to what the speaker was saying. The talk was dealing with marriage. When the speaker read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:38-46:7:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:38</a>: “Consequently he also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better,” the little boy leaned over, looked at his mother and asked, “Mother, why did you get married?”</p>

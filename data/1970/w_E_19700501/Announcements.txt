FIELD MINISTRY
Accurate knowledge from God’s Word is vital for building a strong faith. From study of the Bible true Christians know how important faith with works is if one is to be well-pleasing in God’s sight. (Heb. 11:6) The book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” has proved to be faith-strengthening in helping honest-hearted persons to understand the Bible book of Revelation. From their own personal experience Jehovah’s witnesses have found what is stated at Revelation 1:3 to be true: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy.” During May they will be offering this faith-building publication to the public, along with a free booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
NO LONGER A MYSTERY!
To many persons the Bible is a mystery, so much so that some set it aside as impractical. Especially is this so when they read one of the Bible’s books like Revelation, also called the Apocalypse. It might surprise you to know that this book even speaks of the “mystery of God” in connection with the visions recorded therein. But, the mystery is not one to be left unraveled or unsolved, because John, the disciple of Jesus who received the visions, was told the mystery would be known and its understanding would be one of great wonder and delight to all men because of the benefits due to come to them. Now you can read it for yourself. Send for the fascinating book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” Send today. Only 50c.

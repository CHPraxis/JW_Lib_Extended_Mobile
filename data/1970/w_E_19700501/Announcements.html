From study of the Bible true Christians know how important faith with works is if one is to be well-pleasing in God’s sight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6</a>) The book <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” </em>has proved to be faith-strengthening in helping honest-hearted persons to understand the Bible book of Revelation. From their own personal experience Jehovah’s witnesses have found what is stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 1:3</a> to be true: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy.” During May they will be offering this faith-building publication to the public, along with a free booklet, on a contribution of 50c.</p>

Now you can read it for yourself. Send for the fascinating book <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” </em>Send today. Only 50c.</p>

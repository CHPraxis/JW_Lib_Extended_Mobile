<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A witness of Jehovah in New York writes this interesting incident: “I was a former Sunday-school teacher in the Presbyterian church. After studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses for a while, I questioned my minister about such teachings as the Trinity, and I discovered that he could not answer any of my questions from the Bible. This minister claimed that there were other human creations of God besides Adam and Eve. I asked him to show me this in the Bible. He did not have a Bible with him, so I handed him mine.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Well, this clergyman fumbled through the pages of Genesis, and when I saw that he could not find the creation account, I told him to turn back a few pages.” This clergyman could not locate the creation account that is found in the first two chapters of the Bible! How can clergymen who are ignorant of the Bible lead their congregations into the path of pure worship?</p>

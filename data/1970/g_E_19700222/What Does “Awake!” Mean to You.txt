“Keep the magazines coming. . . . I find Awake! very valuable in furthering the cause of Christianity. My grandchildren are interested in the wonderful geography articles and the answers to many questions about religions other than their own. . . . We sometimes read Awake! together during lunch time as a base for prayer requests.
“All this for one dollar a year is truly not only the best investment I have ever made but a spiritual blessing to both Roman Catholics and Protestants as well.”

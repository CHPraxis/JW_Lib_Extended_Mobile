New Understanding Can Be Yours
God’s message for mankind, contained in the Bible, was meant to be understood. Unfortunately, such understanding is notably rare today. Nevertheless, a steadily increasing number of persons now feel a definite and urgent need for gaining a clear understanding of the Bible. As a help, a new publication, Aid to Bible Understanding, has been prepared.
The Bible account is made up of many features. People of many races and nations: what they said and did, their customs, emotions and their right or wrong worship; places: including lands, cities and villages, mountains, rivers and torrent valleys, with their native trees and plants, birds and animals; notable events: the rise and fall of empires and kingdoms, political conspiracies and oppressions, major battles; and, most important, the record of God’s dealings with men: his mercy and miraculous saving acts, his judgments, promises and prophecies​—all these things and many more have their place in the Bible record, and the more we know about them the clearer God’s overall purpose can become to us.
Aid to Bible Understanding contains a large number of articles on these subjects, prepared over a period of about five years. Some 250 researchers in more than 90 countries contributed to the work. In checking and editing the information gathered, some forty translations of the Bible in many languages were consulted, and these are cited in the various articles. Thus, you are ensured the best scholarship, including the results of the most recent research.
This first volume contains subjects from Aaron to Exodus. Sent for only $2.50.

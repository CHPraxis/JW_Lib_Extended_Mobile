Respect for the Flag
● A twelve-year-old witness of Jehovah in Renton, Washington, had this experience in school one day: During a flag-salute ceremony his classmates misbehaved so much that the teacher said that she was ashamed of the way they showed disrespect for the flag by their misconduct. Then she said: “B​——​——​ B​——​——​ is one of Jehovah’s witnesses and he does not salute the flag [because of religious reasons]. But he certainly shows respect for it by his fine conduct while it is being saluted.” She then told the misbehaving pupils that it would be better if they deported themselves in a proper manner and did not salute the flag than to salute it and engage in such disrespectful conduct.

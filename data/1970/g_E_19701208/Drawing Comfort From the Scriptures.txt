Drawing Comfort From the Scriptures
“I have remembered your judicial decisions from time indefinite, O Jehovah, and I find comfort for myself.”​—Ps. 119:52.
More than ever before there is need for comfort. Depression, grief, fear and similar emotions plague mankind. But where can you find genuine comfort in these critical times? The surest way to gain real comfort is to draw it from the Holy Scriptures. In fact, the Bible was written that you might have a bright hope by drawing “comfort from the Scriptures.”​—Rom. 15:4.
But to draw comfort from the Scriptures you need an easy-to-understand translation of the Holy Bible. Outstanding in this regard is the NEW WORLD TRANSLATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.
Here is a complete Bible; its modern-English text thoroughly reliable as well as a joy to read; hardbound; green cover with gold-embossed title; special Bible paper; 1,472 pages, maps, drawings, concordance.
We also strongly recommend a Bible-study aid that will greatly assist you in drawing comfort from the Scriptures. This is the 192-page Bible handbook THE TRUTH THAT LEADS TO ETERNAL LIFE.
Its twenty-two enlightening chapters will help you to understand God’s Word, enabling you to draw rich “comfort from the Scriptures” and share it with loved ones.
Obtain both of these hope-inspiring volumes for only $1.25.

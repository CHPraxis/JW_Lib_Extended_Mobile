<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ How did the names “pineapple” and “coconut” come about? Wilfred Funk in his book <em>Word Origins and Their Romantic Stories </em>answers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Our tropical fruit, the <em>pineapple, </em>came to England rather late. . . . The name <em>pineapple </em>simply meant ‘apple of the pine’ since it looked so much like a pine cone. The <em>coconut </em>. . . has a bit of a smile in it. If you look at the three holes at the bottom, you will see that they resemble a human face. In Spanish and Portuguese the word <em>coco </em>means a grimace or a grimacing face. So a <em>coconut </em>is really a funny-face nut.”</p>

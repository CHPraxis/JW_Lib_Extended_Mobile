<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I have remembered your judicial decisions from time indefinite, O Jehovah, and I find comfort for myself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:52-19:119:52" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 119:52</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">More than ever before there is need for comfort. Depression, grief, fear and similar emotions plague mankind. But where can you find genuine comfort in these critical times? The surest way to gain real comfort is to draw it from the Holy Scriptures. In fact, the Bible was written that you might have a bright hope by drawing “comfort from the Scriptures.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p>

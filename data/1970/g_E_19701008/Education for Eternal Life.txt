Education for Eternal Life
Secular education may prepare you for a career. But can it adequately answer these questions?
● How can you identify the right way to worship the Giver of life?
● What hope is there for the dead?
● How will the earth be made a Paradise of life?
● How can you avoid death-dealing wicked spirits?
Only one kind of education can prepare you for eternal life. Jesus Christ spoke of it, saying: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) If you wish to have this education, you are urged to find it in the Holy Bible.
True, religious sectarianism has resulted in much confusion about the Bible. But now you can dispel the religious fog and determine just what the Holy Scriptures teach. You can acquire a clear understanding of the fundamental teachings of the Bible in a matter of hours.
Education for eternal life can be yours​—by obtaining and reading the book

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Secular education may prepare you for a career. But can it adequately answer these questions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si">● How can you identify the right way to worship the Giver of life?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">● What hope is there for the dead?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">● How will the earth be made a Paradise of life?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">● How can you avoid death-dealing wicked spirits?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Only one kind of education can prepare you for eternal life. Jesus Christ spoke of it, saying: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) If you wish to have this education, you are urged to find it in the Holy Bible.</p>

But now you can dispel the religious fog and determine just what the Holy Scriptures teach. You can acquire a clear understanding of the fundamental teachings of the Bible in a matter of hours.</p>

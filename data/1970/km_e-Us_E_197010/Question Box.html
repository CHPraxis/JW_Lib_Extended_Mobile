<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Are there ways in which we can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for others while engaging in the field ministry?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In our house-to-house ministry, if publishers are organized into small groups it will be easier for the one in charge to keep them all busy. (“Lamp,” p. 82; km 6/69 p. 8) It is helpful when instructions given before entering the territory include directions as to where the publishers are to work, instead of having everyone meet on some street in the territory for further directions. Also, it is good to discuss in advance what to do if they run out of territory before the end of the scheduled time for witnessing. Thus it will not be necessary to wait in a car or stand on a street corner until additional territory can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some have found it effective to start from preselected points and work toward each other in residential areas or apartment buildings as well as rural territory. In this way they do not need to be concerned about whether certain homes have been worked or not, as is sometimes the case when working alternate homes. Rather, they can just keep on working until they meet each other. But where it is necessary to have someone close by in the territory, doing every other house may be advantageous.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There are many factors to be considered. Really, no rules are necessary or advisable. What may be advantageous in certain areas may not work well elsewhere. Weather conditions and the physical circumstances of the publishers need to be considered. But it is beneficial to endeavor to reduce the amount of time spent in waiting for others so more time can be used for actual witnessing.</p>

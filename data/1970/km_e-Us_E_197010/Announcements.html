<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ The <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>this year will include material printed from 1966 through 1970. Since it is a larger index, it takes longer to compile.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ Publishers and pioneers will please order all <em>Yearbooks </em>and calendars through the congregation with which they are associated. Congregations may send their order for calendars on October 15. It will help the Society if you make your order complete so that only one order for calendars is sent by each congregation. The calendar will be available in Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. Orders for the English edition of the <em>1971 Yearbook </em>may be placed starting November 15. The <em>Yearbook </em>will also be available in French, German and Spanish by about December 1. <em>Yearbooks </em>are 50c each and calendars are 25c each. Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1970, may receive a free <em>Yearbook </em>by making request of the literature servant. This will be included in the congregation’s order and, later, credit may be requested from the Society for the pioneer’s copy. Pioneers may obtain additional <em>Yearbooks </em>at 15c each, and all calendars at 25c each.</p>

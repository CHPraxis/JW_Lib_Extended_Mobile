Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Time has passed quickly, and another service year has ended. The annual report has just been completed, and it has certainly been heartwarming for us here at Bethel to see what it contains.
Compared with last year, the average number of publishers in the United States has risen 27,888, to 371,561. Isn’t it wonderful to know that all these have been sharing in magnifying Jehovah’s name? Included among them were 23,507 pioneers each month. And how busy these all have been, for the report shows a marvelous increase over last year of 6,693,117 hours spent in the field ministry, the total this year being 69,791,988, or the equivalent of nearly three million 24-hour days. Just think of it! Very encouraging too is the report on that important work of conducting Bible studies. There were 295,468 studies conducted each month to aid others to learn God’s life-giving Word. Did you have the pleasure of conducting one of those studies?
That this Bible study activity, using the six-month study program, is yielding good fruit is evident in the healthy increase in the number of those baptized. For 1969 the total was 29,730; this past year it was 38,790. So we are finding those who truly want to be disciples of Jesus Christ, and this makes us rejoice.
Now we are keenly anticipating what the new service year will bring. There are many new publishers to be helped to mature; there are thousands of Bible students to bring into association with Jehovah’s organization; and the time left in which to start studies with others and to assist them to take their stand with Jehovah is reduced. So, with deep appreciation for the service entrusted to us, let us share in it to the full.
Be assured of our warm love for each one of you.
Your brothers,

How Did We Do in August?
The news of a new peak of 388,920 proclaimers of the good news for the United States is indeed a cause for great joy. That means an advance of 29,774 publishers over last yearâ€™s peak. And despite the influx of new publishers, we were able to maintain an excellent average of 10.9 hours in the field ministry. May our appreciation continue at this high level!

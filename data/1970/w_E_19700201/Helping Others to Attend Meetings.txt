Helping Others to Attend Meetings
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES love their neighbors and go out of their way to help those interested in the Bible to attend their meetings. They know that at these meetings these interested individuals can learn much more about Jehovah God’s requirements for life. An example of this demonstration of love comes from Truk, in the Pacific. A Witness missionary there wrote the following:
“Our meeting attendance has doubled this past month. Many interested persons with whom we study the Bible felt that they could not attend our meetings because of not having transportation. We overcame the problem in this way. We began walking to the meetings ourselves instead of riding. Our meeting place is about two miles from the missionary home. Between these two places we conduct several home Bible studies with interested persons.
“It takes about forty minutes to walk from our home to the meeting, so as we walk we invite these interested persons to walk along with us to the meeting. This has proved to be very effective. The very first week we walked, two persons joined us, the next week four, the third week eight and this past week our group has grown to ten persons. Nearly all of these persons are new ones who have never attended the meetings before. When they see faces they know going with us it encourages them to come along.”

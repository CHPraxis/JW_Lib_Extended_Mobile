<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Being a good listener is essential to our being well informed. If we do not listen intently we often do not get the sense of what has been said. Have you not found this to be true from your own experience? In matters pertaining to pure worship we certainly want to be listening intently, as when God’s Word is discussed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:2-23:55:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 55:2</a>) Being well informed can save your life, so there is every reason to listen to God’s Word and learn of the life-preserving provisions that he has made for obedient mankind. During the month of February, Jehovah’s witnesses will encourage those whom they meet in their house-to-house ministry to listen carefully to what God has to say. To that end they will offer a year’s subscription for this Bible magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>along with three booklets, for $1.</p>

NEW FIELDS OF UNDERSTANDING
Perhaps you are already acquainted with many familiar passages of the Bible. But how much do you know about the Book itself. New fields of understanding will be opened to you by a reading of “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” a book that every Bible lover should possess.
For each Bible book it furnishes (1) background and reasons why the book was written, along with evidence of the book’s authenticity; (2) an easily grasped summary of the contents; and (3) discussion of the value of the contents in our modern-day life.
“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” is available through the publishers of this magazine. Send only $1.

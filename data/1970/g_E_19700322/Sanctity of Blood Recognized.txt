Sanctity of Blood Recognized
✔ Today professed Christians, by and large, think it strange that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah take seriously the apostolic prohibition of eating blood in any form as stated at Acts 15:20. But as historian Kaye notes in his work Ecclesiastical History Illustrated from Tertullian’s Writings, pages 146, 209:
“The primitive Christians scrupulously complied with the decree pronounced by the Apostles at Jerusalem in abstaining from things strangled and from blood.”
Bearing this out are the words of Tertullian himself, as found in chapter 9 of his Apology: “Christians, who have not even the blood of animals at their meals simple and natural food; who abstain from things strangled and that die a natural death, for no other reason than that they may not contract pollution, so much as from blood secreted in the viscera. To clench this matter with a single example, you tempt Christians with sausages of blood, just because you are perfectly aware that the thing by which you thus try to get them to transgress they hold unlawful.”​—The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 3, pp. 25, 58.

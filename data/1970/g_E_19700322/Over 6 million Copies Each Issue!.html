<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is the circulation of <em>The Watchtower, </em>companion magazine to <em>Awake! </em>Its consistent and undivided attention to providing spiritually upbuilding material is one of the chief reasons for its growing popularity. And its growing popularity, in view of its contents, is evidence that people still are “conscious of their spiritual need” and know that only the Bible, and the truth of God’s Word, can satisfy it. Are you one of such? Read <em>The Watchtower </em>regularly.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">How would YOU answer the question</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Are you convinced that the Almighty God has provided a written guide for all mankind? Do you believe that the Bible is that guide? Or do you consider the Bible to be a “good book” written by wise men of ancient times​—but no more than that?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You may hesitate to answer because you have never personally read the Bible. Or, even if you have, you may have had difficulty in understanding certain parts or may even have read things that seemed contradictory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But however you may feel about it, the Bible does deal with matters that vitally concern you​—your personal welfare, your happiness, your security.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What are the facts?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Now you can have a satisfactory answer. The book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God? </em>fills a real need for honest-hearted persons who sincerely want to know. Among its challenging chapters are those answering these questions: “Genesis Account of Creation​—Fact or Fiction?” “Was There an Earth-wide Flood?” “The Bible and Ancient History​—Do They Agree?” “Are the Miracles of the Bible True?” “Does the Bible Contradict Itself?” “Is the Bible Practical for Our Day?” “Do Christendom’s Churches Represent the Bible?”</p>

Is the Bible Really the Word of God?
How would YOU answer the question
Are you convinced that the Almighty God has provided a written guide for all mankind? Do you believe that the Bible is that guide? Or do you consider the Bible to be a “good book” written by wise men of ancient times​—but no more than that?
You may hesitate to answer because you have never personally read the Bible. Or, even if you have, you may have had difficulty in understanding certain parts or may even have read things that seemed contradictory.
But however you may feel about it, the Bible does deal with matters that vitally concern you​—your personal welfare, your happiness, your security.
What are the facts?
Now you can have a satisfactory answer. The book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? fills a real need for honest-hearted persons who sincerely want to know.

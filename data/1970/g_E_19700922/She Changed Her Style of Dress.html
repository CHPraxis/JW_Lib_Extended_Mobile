<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During her house-to-house ministry a witness of Jehovah in Columbus, Georgia, met a fashionable young woman. She was a Presbyterian and taught Sunday school. Her preacher taught the modern concept of “free thinkers” and that “mod dress” was part of their “expression.” All of her dresses were of micro-mini length.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This woman accepted the free home Bible study offered by the Witness. In time it was tactfully drawn to her attention that the Bible teaches modesty of dress for Christian women. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>) Though she came to the Kingdom Hall wearing her usual-length dresses, the Witnesses warmly welcomed her. And she casually observed the modest dress of the women in the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As she studied the Bible she began to see that her religious leader had misguided her. Now she realized that one is either under the spirit of Jehovah or under the spirit of the world. She cried. But she showed so much appreciation for God’s truth that she began recommending it to others.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Soon she appeared at the Kingdom Hall with a dress on that was of modest length. The Witnesses there all rejoiced with her. Truly, the truth of God helps persons to make over their minds in harmony with the will of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1, 2</a>.</p>

Doctors Stop Smoking
◆ ‘Britain’s doctors are quitting the smoking habit in greater numbers than are the people in other occupations. . . . Also physicians are the only British group in which lung cancer is least common. Dr. Zorab believes this is due to the fact that doctors are “scared stiff” from seeing patients with lung cancer.’​—GP, June 1969.

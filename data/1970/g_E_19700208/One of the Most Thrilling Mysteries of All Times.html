<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Most people are interested in a good mystery, but most mysteries are simple stories that have little or no lasting influence on the average reader.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But . . . did you know that the Bible book of Revelation speaks of a mysterious scroll sealed with seven seals that was of such vital importance to all mankind that the Christian apostle John, who saw it in vision extended in the hand of God, wept because he thought for a moment no one would be found worthy of opening the seals? What could be of such vital importance?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The handwritten scroll set forth what the Almighty God knew regarding the future of heaven and earth and what he himself purposed to do in the face of things that he allowed to occur. But how can <em>we </em>know?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One was found who was worthy to open the seals, the “Lamb of God” himself, although the opening of each seal and the revealing of the corresponding part of the scroll only provided a further bit of mystery. What was revealed was in symbolic language or in images, but the symbolisms are now being fulfilled in actual human history. What John saw was in vision. What we see is in reality, in actual human experience, calling for the breaking of the seals of the scroll once again, in a supplementary way, in our own marvelous century so full of events of universal interest and importance.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You will be held spellbound, as John was, as he watched God’s worthy One break the seals and let the contents of the prophetic scroll be disclosed to view. Read it in the fascinating new book</p>

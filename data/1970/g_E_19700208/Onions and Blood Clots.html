<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ <em>Time </em>magazine of March 28, 1969, reported an unusual benefit derived from eating onions. A Burmese doctor who conducted tests with twenty-two patients found that the lowly onion contains something that works against blood clots. He found that when fourteen patients had eaten a breakfast containing over three ounces of fat, their blood-borne protection against clotting dropped quickly. On another day when they were given the same breakfast with two ounces of fried onions added, their levels of anti-clotting factors rose instead of falling. This happened despite the extra fat that was used in frying. The tests with the other eight patients were with boiled onions, and the results were much the same.</p>

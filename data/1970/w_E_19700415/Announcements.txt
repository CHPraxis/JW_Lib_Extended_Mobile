FIELD MINISTRY
True Christians know how important it is to be faithful in all matters pertaining to pure worship. (1 Chron. 22:13) To serve Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ faithfully necessitates a study of the Bible so as to know clearly what we are to do. Each issue of the Watchtower magazine aids millions of persons world wide to gain knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes for mankind. To help others be a success in God’s eyes, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering in their house-to-house ministry during April a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.
WHAT WILL THE 1970’S BRING?
Many believe that the 1970’s will see drastic changes in man’s affairs, some hoping for the better, others fearing the worst. What is your view? Whether good or bad, no man knows for sure unless Jehovah God himself reveals it. Will he do so? His own Word says, Yes! Through his prophet Amos, Jehovah has promised: “For the Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.” (Amos 3:7) Do not guess! And do not be unprepared! Whatever the future holds, it can work to your good if you read the Bible regularly, assisted by The Watchtower. Send today. One year, $1.

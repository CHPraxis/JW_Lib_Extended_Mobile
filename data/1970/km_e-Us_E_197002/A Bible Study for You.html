<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When totaling the reports, what a pleasure it was to find that 288,431 home Bible studies were being conducted in the United States during December! Much of our field ministry involves preaching the Kingdom message to all sorts of people ‘for the purpose of a witness,’ and we all share in this very necessary work every time we go from house to house. Yet, where there is genuine interest, we have the responsibility to “make disciples . . . teaching them” and preparing them for baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) So, when we preach, it is good to have prominently in mind, not only placing literature, but also starting studies. Do you do that?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In 1967, 42.9 percent of the publishers shared in the Bible-study ministry. The year of 1969 saw a fine increase to 46.3 percent. No doubt many more would be very willing to share in this joyful activity. Perhaps that is true of you. If so, how can you get a study started?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Much depends on your spending sufficient time in the house-to-house work, seeking out interested ones. The more time you spend, the more opportunities there are. That is why many who vacation pioneer are able to start new studies during their time of increased activity. Next, make it known at every appropriate opportunity that you are offering not only Bible literature, but also free personal assistance in understanding the Bible. And, finally, be sure to call back on everyone who accepts literature as well as on others who show interest. If, at present, you do these things to some extent, might it be that doing them more fully would lead to a home Bible study? Yes, in most cases it would.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>It is not difficult to invite a householder to have a home Bible study, whether you do it on your initial visit or on a back-call. Tell him how much you enjoyed the study that was conducted with you, and that now you would like to share the same delightful truths with him. Of course, he will have questions in his mind. Perhaps the easiest way to answer them is to hand him a copy of the Bible-study folder and read it together. Then, before asking whether he wants a study, why not open the <em>Truth </em>book to the first chapter (or any other chapter that discusses what particularly interests him) and read and discuss a few paragraphs. Where possible, at least on this first call, use the householder’s Bible when reading the scriptures. Having done this, ask if you may return to continue the discussion. If he agrees and you are able to make a definite appointment, you have the foundation laid for a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>However, if your call is cut short because he is busy, at least leave him the Bible-study folder. Then be sure to call back. When you return, you can refer to the folder <span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>and proceed just as you would have on the first call if time had permitted.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>By the way, have you called back on everyone with whom you placed the <em>Word of God </em>book and the Bible in December? If not, don’t put it off any longer. They have shown interest; but, as you know from personal experience, very few will make much progress without personal assistance. If the problem is that you cannot find them home again, why not call them on the phone or write them a letter, or perhaps leave the Bible-study folder in their door with your name and phone number and a note suggesting that they call you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>None of us need feel that we cannot conduct a Bible study because we will not be able to answer all their questions. Jehovah will bless our efforts if we are willing. Really, what is it that most householders need? They need your presence and your conviction that this is the truth. As for answers, they are right there in the <em>Truth </em>book and presented in a very understandable manner. But the problem is that many people will not read it unless someone calls regularly to encourage them. Others may read the book but do not take time to look up the scriptures, and so do not get the full impact of it. Your simply being there with them, discussing the material, and helping them to see how deeply you appreciate God’s Word is what they need. The results do not depend on your eloquence, or on your knowing all the answers, but on your willingness to ‘plant and water,’ and it is “God who makes it grow.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As soon as subscription expiration slips are received by the congregation, they are given to publishers so that calls can be made promptly. Diligence in following through on such matters is important. When the householder cannot be found after repeated calls are made, a sample copy of the magazine can be left with a note saying the subscription has expired, you have tried to get in touch with the individual, etc. A Bible-study folder could be left at the same time, showing your name and phone number, and suggesting that the householder call you. Or, write a letter if you wish.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>When a person is contacted, you may find it effective to mention at the outset that you are calling on former subscribers. In this way the householder will know how you got his address. Then give a short presentation incorporating a point from one of the current magazines. After a brief discussion, show where this was taken from in the magazine so the householder will be helped to appreciate its practical value and have a desire to resubscribe. Or, you may want to use the Bible-study folder to explain the free Bible-study offer and then inquire about renewing the subscription thereafter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>“When encouraging a person to renew his subscription, we might <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>say something like, “I get the magazines myself through the mail for $1 a year and find them to be very helpful. . . . ” The price is mentioned in an incidental way, in the event that the person does not remember what it will cost him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>If you have older expiration slips that have not been called on, dig them out and call on them without delay. There must have been some interest previously if the individual subscribed. So, give the individual the opportunity to renew his subscription; and if you can revive and expand the interest, that certainly would be a fine accomplishment, wouldn’t it?</p>

How Did We Do in December?
In spite of cold weather in many parts of the country, the average hours increased to 9.7, to compare with last December’s average of 9.4. This shows that creature comforts were not placed ahead of Kingdom interests.
The total publisher figure of 363,190 is just slightly below the all-time-high peak of 364,320 for November 1969. This represents a 9-percent increase over the total of 333,354 publishers for December 1968​—29,836 more publishers! We are greatly encouraged by this manifold evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts to “make disciples” as commanded by Jesus.
Do we have reason to expect further evidences of Jehovah’s blessing in the form of publisher increases? Yes, because 745,638 Bibles and books were placed during December. These, along with other literature placements, represent a fine contribution toward the number of symbolic “horses” mentioned at Revelation 9:16-19, and provide a wonderful basis for getting new studies started, don’t they?

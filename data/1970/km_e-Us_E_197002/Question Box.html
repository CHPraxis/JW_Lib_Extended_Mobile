<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How should we go about terminating unfruitful Bible studies?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This is a question that we ought to consider if any of our present studies have been in progress for approximately six months. Are they coming to the congregation meetings as yet, and are they beginning to make their lives over in harmony with what they have learned from God’s Word? If so, we want to continue to help them. But, if not, it may be that we could accomplish more good with our time by using it to witness to others.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you realize that you should terminate a particular study, discuss it with the householder in a kindly way. Let him know that you have counted it a privilege to share with him what the Bible says, but remind him that it is a six-month free study course that we offer. Now it is up to him to decide what he will do about what he has learned and to take the initiative to follow through.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:14-6:24:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 24:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Emphasize the urgency of the times and explain that we want to give others the same opportunity to learn the truth and take their stand on Jehovah’s side.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Explain to the householder that you will be available and that if he wants to get in touch with you you will be glad to help him spiritually. Encourage him to think seriously about the course he should take in order to please Jehovah and to pray about it. Urge him to come to the meetings, and let him know that if he really decides to serve Jehovah and regularly associates with the congregation, you will be glad to resume the study, using more advanced material to help him progress to maturity.</p>

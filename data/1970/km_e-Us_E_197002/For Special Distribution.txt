For Special Distribution
Do you have in your territory any of the young folks known as “hippies”? There are thousands who have adopted their ways and their outlook. Among them are many who are sincerely fed up with the hypocrisy of the present system and who are seeking an answer to the terrible world conditions.
The March 8 issue of Awake!, featuring the subject “Why the ‘Hippie’ Movement?” is designed to help them. We suggest that you make a special effort to get it into their hands. And, with each copy, include a Bible-study folder and a handbill for your local meetings.
This same magazine will be excellent to place with parents and anyone else who is concerned about what is happening to youths and who wonders what it all means and what can be done about it.
If you can use more than your usual supply of this issue, we will be glad to fill your order.

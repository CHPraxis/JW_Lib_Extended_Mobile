Ability to Hear
◆ A person’s ability to hear changes with age. At birth, a baby apparently does not hear at all for a few days. Lower tones are increasingly heard until the age of about twenty-five. At about the age of fifty, the ability to hear higher tones diminishes. For some, the loss of ability to hear these high tones may start at twenty-five years of age. However, in God’s new order, hearing ability will reach a perfect state and remain that way forever.

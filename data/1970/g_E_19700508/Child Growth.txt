Child Growth
● Did you know that a child’s head grows upward and outward in perfect balance until it is double its original size? The arms grow to four times their original length, while the legs grow to five times what their length was at birth. The trunk becomes three times as long as when the baby was born. All this marvelous growth takes place gradually over a period of time until the babe has become a full-grown man or woman. That is the way the Creator designed the process of human growth.

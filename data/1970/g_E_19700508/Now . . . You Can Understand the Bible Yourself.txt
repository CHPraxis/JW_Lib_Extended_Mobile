Now . . . You Can Understand the Bible Yourself
Did you know that God himself promised that he would make known his Word to his servants? Through his prophet Amos he caused it to be recorded: “The Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.​—Amos 3:7.
The Almighty God is here reassuring us that his purpose toward us will be known. And that purpose, recorded in the Bible through his prophets of old, is now being unfolded in a most marvelous way, because the time foretold to Daniel is now here. “And as for you, O Daniel, make secret the words and seal up the book, until the time of the end. Many will rove about, and the true knowledge will become abundant.”​—Dan. 12:4.
Centuries later, John, the faithful prophet and apostle of Jesus Christ, was given a revelation of “things that must shortly take place.” Further, he was told: “Happy . . . those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written in it; for the appointed time is near.”​—Rev. 1:1, 3.
John was then told: “In the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.”​—Rev. 10:7.

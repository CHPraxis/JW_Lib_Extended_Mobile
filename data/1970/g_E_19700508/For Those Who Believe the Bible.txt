For Those Who Believe the Bible
In spite of many efforts to discredit the Bible and deny its value to our generation, there are many who still view it as the Book of Books and who would like to know more about it. To understand the Bible we must see it in sharp focus. That requires a foundation knowledge of the many features that go to make up the Bible account. For example, how well acquainted are you with the various peoples, the places, the notable events and the record of Godâ€™s dealings with men as outlined in the Bible? Now you can have authoritative information on all these significant matters. The first volume of Aid to Bible Understanding, covering subjects under the letters from A to E, is available for $2.50.

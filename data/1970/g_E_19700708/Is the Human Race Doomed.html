<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some authorities think so. They see world famine, death-dealing pollution and an all-pervading spirit of lawlessness. Can the human race be saved? From man’s viewpoint the future looks very grim. Predictions of calamity to come are not at all farfetched. But take courage, there is a sure hope! What is it? It will be discussed in the inspiring public address “SAVING THE HUMAN RACE​—IN THE KINGDOM WAY.”</p>

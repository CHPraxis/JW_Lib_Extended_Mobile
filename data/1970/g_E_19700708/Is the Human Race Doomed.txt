Is the Human Race Doomed?
Some authorities think so. They see world famine, death-dealing pollution and an all-pervading spirit of lawlessness. Can the human race be saved? From man’s viewpoint the future looks very grim. Predictions of calamity to come are not at all farfetched. But take courage, there is a sure hope! What is it? It will be discussed in the inspiring public address “SAVING THE HUMAN RACE​—IN THE KINGDOM WAY.”
This is the title of the feature talk at the “Men of Goodwill” District Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. You are invited to attend this special address as well as all the other sessions. Four days of delightful and upbuilding Bible discourses and dramas! Plan now to attend. For exact dates and the location nearest you see Awake! of June 22, 1970, or write to the publishers of this magazine.

Widely Read Magazines
The Word, an international Catholic magazine published in Ireland, recently reported: “The Watchtower Society has always stressed the printed word. . . . Its magazine Watchtower reports a circulation of about four times the circulation of the world’s largest Catholic periodical. Its companion publication, Awake! claims a circulation of 4 million.” Yes, these magazines are read by millions of lovers of God’s Word in all parts of the world. In fact, since the writer of the article quoted above obtained his figures, both The Watchtower and Awake! have increased in circulation by some 50 percent.

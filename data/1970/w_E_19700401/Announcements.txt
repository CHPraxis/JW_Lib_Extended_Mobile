FIELD MINISTRY
True Christians know how important it is to be faithful in all matters pertaining to pure worship. (1 Chron. 22:13) To serve Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ faithfully necessitates a study of the Bible so as to know clearly what we are to do. Each issue of the Watchtower magazine aids millions of persons world wide to gain knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes for mankind. To help others to be a success in God’s eyes, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering in their house-to-house ministry during April a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.

Now these explanations can be fully understood because the day of their fulfillment is here. That makes it vital for us to investigate them, especially when we learn that they are tied in with the greatest issue of all times: the future rulership of our earth as well as heaven. Join with countless other persons in the benefits this will bring. Learn what this book of “mystery,” the Bible book of Revelation, means for our day.

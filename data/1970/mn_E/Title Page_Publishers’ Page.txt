“Look! I Am Making All Things New”
How tired we all are of the old things! We and our forefathers have suffered because of them for so long! And things keep getting worse. Men are trying to change things for the better. Yet men have nothing new to offer, and they prove themselves unable to wipe out hatred, oppression, poverty, wickedness, suffering and death.
However, the great Creator, who sits on high in the heavens, has observed all this human helplessness. He promises us a real change for the better, yes, for the best. We can believe him when he says to us in his written Word: “Look! I am making all things new.” These words have inspired the writing of this beautiful booklet. Your reading it will give you a truly new outlook for the future, which you may live to enjoy. For this reason we take pleasure in publishing it, and we wish you Heaven’s blessing in reading it that you may fully enter into the happy new things.

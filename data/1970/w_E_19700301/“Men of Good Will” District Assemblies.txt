“Men of Good Will” District Assemblies
If you are a person who appreciates the importance of having God’s goodwill, you will be glad to know that the Watch Tower Society is making arrangements for a series of “Men of Good Will” District Assemblies during June, July and August in the northern hemisphere.
Each assembly will feature an upbuilding and thoroughly enjoyable four-day program. To benefit from it to the full, plan to be on hand when it begins early Thursday afternoon, and stay until the conclusion on Sunday afternoon.
The assemblies are scheduled for thirty-three cities in the United States, ten in Canada and eight in Britain, in addition to assemblies in other lands. So there should be an assembly city near you.
Check the list and select the one that you will attend. Then make definite arrangements to be there, and seek Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts to that end. Unless otherwise indicated, the programs for the assemblies listed here will be in English, but, as you will notice, some of the assemblies include other languages or, in some cases, are exclusively in another tongue. Assemblies for the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the British Isles are listed below.

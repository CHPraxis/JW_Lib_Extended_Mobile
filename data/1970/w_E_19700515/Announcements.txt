FIELD MINISTRY
Accurate knowledge from God’s Word is vital for building a strong faith. From study of the Bible true Christians know how important faith with works is if one is to be well-pleasing in God’s sight. (Heb. 11:6) The book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” has proved to be faith-strengthening by helping honest-hearted persons to understand the Bible book of Revelation. From their own personal experience Jehovah’s witnesses have found what is stated at Revelation 1:3 to be true: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy.” During May they will be offering this faith-building publication to the public, along with a free booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
A REFERENCE WORK TO RELY UPON
If a book that claims to contribute toward a better understanding of the Bible views the Bible as simply the product of men and not an inspired document, would you have complete confidence in that book when it endeavored to explain to you the many features that go to make up the Bible’s account? Many modern dictionaries of the Bible and Bible commentaries contain much that is helpful and useful, but most also either openly or subtly deny the Bible’s accuracy and thereby undermine faith in it. In this regard, Aid to Bible Understanding is different. It accepts the Bible as the principal authority and is guided by it. The first volume of this valuable reference work, covering subjects from A to E, is now available. Send only $2.50.

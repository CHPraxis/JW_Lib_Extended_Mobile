New Peaks in November!
Yes, 364,320 publishers is another new peak for the United States, 6 percent over last year’s average! This means that during the 1969 calendar year we have had four new all-time peaks in publishers in the United States. What a pleasure to see such fine increase!
We also saw another new peak of 14,598 regular pioneers. This is the fifth consecutive peak in pioneers since the “Peace on Earth” assemblies held here last summer!
These are excellent reports, brothers! With you we thank Jehovah for the increase he is giving and we are happy to be busy with you planting and watering, teaching and making disciples.

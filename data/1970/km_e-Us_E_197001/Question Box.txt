Question Box
● If the householder does not take the subscription(s) what might be presented as an alternate offer?
Two magazines on ten-cent contribution could be offered. It might be the beginning of a magazine route. You may find also, after the householder reads the individual magazines, that he will then desire to obtain the subscription(s).
Or, one of the 25-cent pocket-sized publications​—the “Truth,” “Evolution” or “Word of God” book—​could be offered.
By all means, acquaint the householder with our free, six-month Bible study course. You may wish to offer to demonstrate the study procedure right then, or if this is not convenient, you may be able to arrange to do this at a later time. Remember, if at all possible, we want to start and conduct home Bible studies with people. We want to make disciples of people. So, continue to make good use of the Bible-study folder.

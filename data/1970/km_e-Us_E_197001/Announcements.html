<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ During the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign many try to reach the following goals: Publishers, 2 subscriptions; pioneers, 20, and special pioneers, 30. If you wish to arrange for a chart of some sort to show the progress of the congregation during the subscription campaign, this can be done.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ The Memorial will be held Sunday, March 22, after 6 p.m., local standard time. Each congregation may make its own arrangements for the <em>Watchtower </em>study, possibly on the book study night at the rendezvous or on Saturday at the Kingdom Hall. All day Sunday can be devoted to field service, followed by the Memorial after 6 p.m. The circuit servant may give the Memorial talk if the congregation he will be visiting requests it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the circuit servant is visiting the congregation, adjustments in his program may be made to fit local circumstances. He may give his final talk on Saturday evening. He will not give his public talk.</p>

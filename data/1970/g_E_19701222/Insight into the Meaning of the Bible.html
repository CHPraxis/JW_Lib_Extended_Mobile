<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Would you like to have more insight into the meaning of the Bible? especially the portion commonly called the “New Testament”? Since English versions are only translations, sometimes the finer shades of meaning of the original language are lost. You can, of course, read the “Christian Greek Scriptures” in one of the fine modern-English translations​—but you can, in addition, follow the original Greek with the exact word-for-word translation written between the lines. Now you can know the <strong>exact </strong>meaning of the original language of the Christian Greek Scriptures. You can make your own comparison with any other translation and determine its accuracy.</p>

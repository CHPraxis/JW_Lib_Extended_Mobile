Eagle’s Nest
● Most persons think of birds’ nests as measuring several inches across and a few inches deep. Indeed, many are this size. However, the golden eagle, whose wingspread is about seven feet, builds king-sized nests. Found in lonely mountainous regions of North America, Europe, northern Africa and Asia, the golden eagle builds its nests on rocky shelves of steep mountainsides or high in tall trees. One nest of a golden eagle was found to be seven feet high, and six feet wide on top! It took large quantities of material to build!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ Dr. I. S. Wright, president of the American College of Physicians, after thirty years of studying the problems of the aged, says that the present system of compulsory retirement is deplorable: it is a waste of human energies and capabilities; it is discriminatory; it is detrimental to economy. Records show that workers over sixty-five years of age have less absenteeism than workers in their twenties. Insurance statistics seem to indicate that men who keep on working live longer, while those who retire unwillingly apparently do not even live out the years allotted them in life insurance tables.</p>

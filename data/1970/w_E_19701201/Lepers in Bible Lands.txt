Lepers in Bible Lands
● Some years ago many lepers could be seen alongside a road near Nablus, a town in the Middle East. These would cry out to passers by from a distance. They had no home nor could they live with their relatives. These lepers slept in caves, ruins of old buildings or in cabins that they had built. Food was left for them at a certain spot. And they would come for it only after the donors had gone away. How much such ones need the blessings of God’s kingdom!

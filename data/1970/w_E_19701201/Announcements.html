<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>VALUABLE BOOKS FOR YOUR HOME</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Every home can be enriched by including a copy of God’s Word, the Holy Bible, in its library. That Book of books contains divine counsel for your family and furnishes strong reasons for you to hope in God’s promise of a righteous new system of things right here on earth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To benefit fully from the Bible’s wisdom, you need an accurate and modern translation, one that uses the easily understood language of this twentieth century. The <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>meets that need.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Very beneficial, too, is a handbook that simplifies Bible study and gives you a brief, easy-to-understand summary of what the Bible really teaches. Its title: <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life; </em>hardbound, having 192 pages.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">During the month of December Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering those two valuable books in their house-to-house ministry. These two volumes, with a free booklet, may be obtained on a contribution of $1.25. Or, you may write the publishers of this journal and these books, together with the free booklet <em>World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace, </em>will be sent to you postpaid for only $1.25.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The same <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>as well as the above-mentioned Bible handbook, is also available in Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and Spanish.</p>

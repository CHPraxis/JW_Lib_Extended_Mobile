A BOON TO BIBLE STUDENTS
Now you can check on the basic meaning of the original Greek words in the Bible, without necessarily having a knowledge of the Greek language. This is possible because of the Watch Tower Society’s new Bible version, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures. This unique Bible-study aid presents the literal English translation below each Greek word in the left column of the page, while in the right column is provided a revision of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
At a glance, you can compare the basic idea of the Greek word with its counterpart in the finished English translation. Yes, the very nature of this 1,184-page clothbound volume makes it a boon to earnest Bible students.
During their five years of labor on this version the New World Bible Translation Committee had the advantage of a Greek text published by the noted scholars Westcott and Hort. This text was published at least a hundred years later than the one used in that other well-known interlinear translation, The Emphatic Diaglott. The New World Bible Translation Committee could thus avail themselves of the considerable strides made in Greek scholarship.
Now the many benefits of this excellent translation can be yours! Get to know the finer shades of meaning of the original language. An invaluable aid to the Bible student, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures will be sent to you postpaid for $2.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Now you can check on the basic meaning of the original Greek words in the Bible, without necessarily having a knowledge of the Greek language. This is possible because of the Watch Tower Society’s new Bible version, <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</em>. This unique Bible-study aid presents the literal English translation below each Greek word in the left column of the page, while in the right column is provided a revision of the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</em>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At a glance, you can compare the basic idea of the Greek word with its counterpart in the finished English translation. Yes, the very nature of this 1,184-page clothbound volume makes it a boon to earnest Bible students.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During their five years of labor on this version the New World Bible Translation Committee had the advantage of a Greek text published by the noted scholars Westcott and Hort. This text was published at least a hundred years later than the one used in that other well-known interlinear translation, <em>The Emphatic Diaglott</em>. The New World Bible Translation Committee could thus avail themselves of the considerable strides made in Greek scholarship.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Now the many benefits of this excellent translation can be yours! Get to know the finer shades of meaning of the original language. An invaluable aid to the Bible student, <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </em>will be sent to you postpaid for $2.</p>

18 min: Direct Approach for Starting Studies. (Discuss and demonstrate.) In many areas this approach produces excellent results. A circuit servant in Colorado reports that, in addition to the new studies he started (37 in the last 3 months and his wife 25), ‘the publishers and pioneers during my visits to the last 5 congregations started 59 studies and, since the week of my visit, 44 more.’ This makes a total of 103 new studies started by publishers and pioneers using some of these helpful suggestions submitted by the circuit servant: “The emphasis was placed on the offer to demonstrate the study rather than placing emphasis on the study course itself. If householders are asked if they would like to have the study course, before it is demonstrated, usually they will give a negative reply. Some publishers were discouraged in using the direct approach until first trying to demonstrate the study.”
Basically the following approach was used: ‘Good morning, my name is ​———. I’m one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I imagine you have your own religious affiliation? [Let them answer.] it is encouraging to know that you still believe in God at a time when so many people are becoming godless. I’m sure you will agree that things would be much better today if more people would study the Bible in their own homes and live according to Bible principles. [Let them comment.] We, are encouraging home reading of the Bible and offering a free study course. It answers many questions such as, Why do we grow old and die?, Where are the dead?, Why does God permit wickedness?, and many other questions people wonder about. If you have just a few minutes I would like to demonstrate how you can find the answers to such questions in your own Bible. Then you would be in better position to decide whether you would like the free Bible study or not.’ If they say yes, the Bible-study folder can be used, suggesting they pick a question they would like answered from the Bible. If they hesitate, you can ask if they are interested in knowing the condition of the dead or knowing if present world conditions were foretold in the Bible, etc. (Use Bible to answer.)
He concludes, ‘Some new studies have been lost on the first few calls because of trying to get the householder to read paragraphs or scriptures when they do not care to do so.’ Why not ask, ‘Would you like to read or would you prefer that I do so?’ If householder does not desire Bible study demonstration, go ahead with your sermon presentation.
13 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate points from Announcements. Song 20.
WEEK STARTING JUNE 21
Theme: ‘Handling the Word of Truth Aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) Song 100.
 5 min: Introduction, text and comments.
 7 min: Question Box. Talk and experiences as time permits.
18 min: Indirect Approach for Starting Studies.
(2 min.) Chairman: What other approach can we use to start studies if individuals are hesitant, feel uneasy when the direct method is used or may not be ready to accept the responsibility of the six months’ study program? Have you tried the indirect method of starting studies? The “Lamp” book, page 93, states: “At first the person may not even realize that he is having a home Bible study; he just enjoys the fine Bible discussions. In many parts of the world it is necessary to make a number of calls, discussing a variety of topics and answering questions, before it is possible to get down to a regular study.” (See 1970 “Yearbook,” p. 232.) Our offer this month opens the way for studies to be started when placing the Bible or on making return visits by “discussing a variety of topics and answering questions” before getting down to regular study. Why not try the following suggestions, depending upon the interest or questions of the householder?
(14 min.) Bible study servant interviews two study servants. After discussing the suggested indirect approach for starting studies, a servant can demonstrate it. (1) Discuss how publishers can use “Important Bible Words for Quick Reference,” starting on page 1341 of “New World Translation” to aid householders to get acquainted with Bible and to clarify topics of interest such as death (condition of the dead), earth (man’s home), Jehovah, resurrection, etc. Demonstrate how householder is directed to material in the back of the Bible, assisted to use his Bible in looking up scriptures, explaining them, etc. On concluding discussion, servant arouses householder’s interest in another subject to be explained on next call. (2)  Discuss how publishers can prepare Bible discussion material on subject of interest to householder from the Bible, “Word of God,” “Make Sure,” “Truth” books, “Watchtower,” “Awake!,” etc. For example, publisher may list scriptures from Chapter 4 of “Truth” book. (Servant demonstrates use of following on a call)
“Why We Grow Old and Die”
Gen. 1:28, 31​—Man provided lovely home
Gen. 2:16, 17​—Would live if obedient
Gen. 3:1-6​—Disobedience of first pair (Select appropriate portions)
Gen. 3:22-24​—Lawless couple to die
Rom. 5:12​—Effect upon offspring is death (Also Job 14:4 could be used)
1 John 4:9​—Ransom provided by means of Jesus
Rev. 21:3, 4​—Kingdom rule will do away with death
(2 min.) Chairman: Same can be done with “Word of God” book, such as Chapter 10, “Bible Prophecies You Have Seen Fulfilled.” Be discerning in ascertaining interest of householder, as it helps us to determine if all scriptures should be discussed, if it is advisable to switch to another subject of greater interest, etc. Use indirect method with goal of starting a study.
20 min: Associations. (Handled by mature brother. Ask questions below. Allow audience to answer freely.)
What position do Christians take with respect to the world? (John 15:19; Jas. 4:4) Is it possible to avoid all contact with unbelievers? (1 Cor. 5:9, 10; John 17:15, 16) Why is it so imperative to watch our associations? (Prov. 13:20; 2 Pet. 2:18) How should we view all social companionships with those not in the truth? Why? (Gen. 34:1, 2; 1 Cor. 15:33; Eph. 5:7-12; w66, p. 49, par. 5) What kind of association is encouraged in the Bible? (Matt. 18:20; Acts 2:42; Heb. 10:24, 25; w70, p. 150, par. 20) How would the above principles be applied to the following associations? Give scriptures or Bible principles to support your answers. Schoolmates and fellow employees? (Ps. 119:115; w66, pp. 49-51; 2 Cor. 6:14-17; 2 Tim. 3:2, 5; 1 Pet. 4:4) Disfellowshipped persons? (1 Cor. 5:11; Rom. 16:17; “Lamp” book, p. 180) Dating those not dedicated? (w64, p. 155, par. 1; w67, p. 765; w69, p. 373, par. 26; w65, p. 562, par. 11) What is the purpose of dating and what may a congregation rightfully expect of those who regularly date for an extended period of time? (w64, p. 155, par. 3) Marriage? (Deut. 7:3, 4; 1 Cor. 7:39; 2 Cor. 6:14, 15) If one thinks these Bible principles are restrictive, what could be said to aid and encourage him? (w66, p. 53)

Question Box
● How can people in your territory contact Jehovah’s witnesses?
Some congregations have a telephone at the Kingdom Hall listed in the phone book under “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This has been helpful to many desiring to contact us. But what if no one is at the hall when someone calls? An interested person in a Midwest city made ten phone calls (three Kingdom Halls were listed) but was unable to contact anyone because no one was at the halls to answer. The overseer may want to list another phone number to call if there is no answer at the Kingdom Hall​—either his own number or that of someone who can make tactful reply to those who call. (“Lamp” book, p. 64) Many fine experiences have been sent to the Society concerning interested persons who contacted Jehovah’s witnesses by phone. As a result of publishers’ writing a phone number on the Bible-study folder, numerous householders have called requesting Bible studies. One experience states: “The lady phoned and said she had been thinking about studying the Bible and would enjoy it very much. A study was started and the interested person now attends meetings.”
Many congregations have arranged for a free listing in the local newspaper of the Kingdom Hall address together with day and time of meetings, and this has been a means of helping people to get in contact with us. (See Question Box in July 1967 “Kingdom Ministry.”)
Of course, we keep in contact with the greatest number of people by our sharing in field service, making liberal use of the handbills, which provide the Kingdom Hall address and time of meetings.

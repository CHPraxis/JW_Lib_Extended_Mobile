“THINGS THAT MUST SHORTLY TAKE PLACE”
This is what the Lord Jesus Christ said about the Bible book of Revelation! Yes, this remarkable portion of Holy Scripture is filled with prophecy about “things that must shortly take place.” (Rev. 1:1) Some of those amazing prophecies have already come to pass; others are still future but will shortly be fulfilled. Now you can have a clearer understanding of this symbol-filled book of Revelation, enabling you to know what the future holds and to be able to plan your life accordingly!
A thrilling verse-by-verse explanation of the first thirteen chapters of Revelation is contained in the volume “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” Here is a book that explains the meaning for our day of the rides of the horsemen of the Apocalypse. Who is the crowned rider on the white horse who goes forth conquering and ends up gaining total victory? He is now near the end of his victorious ride. On which side will you be at that time? You can obtain a copy of “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” from any of Jehovah’s witnesses who may call at your home. During July they will be offering this book, along with a free booklet, in their house-to-house ministry. Or, if you prefer, you may write the publishers of this magazine and a copy will be sent to you. It is hardbound, 384 pages; sent postpaid for only 50c.

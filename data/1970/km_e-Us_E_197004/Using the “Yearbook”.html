<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Are you currently conducting a home Bible study? If so, have you supplied the householder with a copy of the <em>1970 Yearbook </em>and calendar? It would be a fine thing to do. By reading the <em>Yearbook </em>any newly interested one will be aided to appreciate the international scope of the preaching work. As he learns how others have overcome obstacles to attend meetings and to share in serving Jehovah, he will be encouraged to do the same. And the calendar will help to keep before him the goal of becoming a baptized disciple of Jesus.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Society still has on hand a good supply of the <em>1970 Yearbook </em>and calendar, and we would like to have them put to use as early in the year as possible. The <em>Yearbook </em>is now available for 25 cents each, and the calendar for 10 cents. Order as many copies as you can use, and we will be glad to send them just as long as the supply lasts. We encourage you to do it soon.</p>

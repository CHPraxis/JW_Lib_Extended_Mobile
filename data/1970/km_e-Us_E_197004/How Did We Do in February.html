<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There were 170,929 new subscriptions obtained in February, compared with 155,048 last February. This makes a total of 362,171 for the first two months of the current “Watchtower” campaign. This is 61,232 more than last January and February​—an increase of 20 percent! It is evident there is much interest yet to be cared for in the little time remaining, is it not?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The total publisher figure of 365,886 represents a 7.2 percent increase over last February, only 158 publishers short of the all-time high peak in January of this year. And we have another new peak in pioneers, going over 15,000 for the first time.</p>

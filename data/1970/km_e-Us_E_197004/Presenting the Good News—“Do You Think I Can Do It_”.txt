Presenting the Good News​—“Do You Think I Can Do It?”
1 Perhaps you are one that has been attending the service meetings and listening to different ones speaking about having a part in field service. Have you been wondering whether you could take part in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and wanting to ask someone, “Do you think I can do it?” You will be glad to know that the answer is, “Yes; everyone who is associated with the congregation and meets the qualifications can speak to others about the Kingdom message.” Through Jehovah’s visible organization the Kingdom message is made available in printed form. You have become familiar with these publications.
2 Everyone can place magazines. Copies of them are available from the magazine-territory servant. Why not go to the place where the magazine supplies are kept and get at least ten copies? You may wish to obtain five of each kind. Then you can offer the two different magazines together when you speak to people. Perhaps at first you would like to go with someone else to see how the magazines are offered. The presentations are very brief, with reference being made to only one or two particular articles or points. Your overseer or any servant will be pleased to help you arrange to go with someone if it is not convenient to make those arrangements yourself. April is a fine opportunity for all of those who love Jehovah to share in the ministry. Because you are associated with the congregation, we say, “Yes, you can do it!”​—1 Chron. 22:13.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">You are no doubt eagerly looking forward to making early arrangements for vacations in order to attend the “Men of Good Will” District Assemblies this summer. Without question you will want to be present at one of the thirty-two assemblies that have been arranged in the United States as listed below:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">June 25-28: Eugene, Ore.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">July 9-12: Bloomington, Minn.; Boston, Mass.; Charlotte, N.C.; Hallandale, Fla. (Spanish also); Hampton, Va.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Jersey City, N.J.; Macon, Ga.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; San Bernardino, Calif. (Spanish only).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">July 16-19: Anaheim, Calif.; Bismarck, N. Dak.; Detroit, Mich. (Spanish also); Jersey City, N.J.; Laurel, Md.; Monroe, La.; Oakland, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">July 23-26: Amarillo, Tex. (Spanish also); Butte, Mont.; El Paso, Tex.; Jersey City, N.J. (Spanish only).</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">July 30–August 2: Alexandria, La.; Fort Worth, Tex.; Fresno, Calif.; St. Louis, Mo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Antonio, Tex.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">August 6-9: Corpus Christi, Tex. (Spanish only).</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">August 13-16: Wilmington, Del.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Generally, brothers attend the nearest assembly. However, there are a few areas where we would like to suggest a preference in order to balance the size of the crowd to suit the facilities that we were able to rent. We suggest that, to the extent possible, the publishers in the New York metropolitan area attend assemblies according to this arrangement: Jersey City assembly for July 9-12: New York circuits #1, #2, #4, #10, #11, #15, #17, #21 and Pennsylvania #2. Jersey City assembly for July 16-19: New York circuits #18, #19, #20 and New Jersey circuits #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7. (Notice that English assemblies will be held in Jersey City on two separate weekends, and the Spanish on a third weekend.) Boston: New York circuits #3, #5, #7, #12 and Connecticut #1. It is recommended that brothers in the Chicago metropolitan area attend the St. Louis assembly; St. Louis could benefit from the large crowd to give a witness there. We would like to ask metropolitan Denver publishers to attend the assembly in Salt Lake City. Since the facilities at Hallandale are considerably larger than those at Jacksonville, it will be helpful if Florida Circuits #2 and #7 will attend the Hallandale convention.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If these arrangements are followed, there should be ample seats for all who attend. This information supercedes what appeared in <em>The Watchtower </em>of March 1, 1970.</p>

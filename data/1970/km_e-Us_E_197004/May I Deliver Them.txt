May I Deliver Them?
When offering subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake! from house to house, we have often been told, “I can’t take them today.” The next time this happens, you might offer to deliver the magazines. In some cases, persons may not be interested in subscribing at the moment, but would be glad to have you deliver the magazines, much the same as newspapers are delivered. Some have personal objections to having our magazines come through the mail to their home, or to having their names on a mailing list, but are glad to take the magazines when someone calls.
There are advantages to having a magazine route, too. For one thing, by your calling regularly you get acquainted with the people. You have opportunity to sow seeds of truth by leaving the magazines for them to read and by your personal comments each time you call. It may be that later they will desire to subscribe for the magazines. It may be, also, that as interest is kindled, the individual or family being called on will be agreeable to a weekly home Bible study. Remember, each time you deliver the magazines, a back-call can be counted.

◆ Have you found at the last minute that you can vacation pioneer during April? Please apply promptly and the Society will be pleased to process your application.
◆ Literature Offer. For April: Watchtower subscription, one year for one dollar, with three booklets given free to new subscribers. For May: “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God,” with one booklet, for 50c. If people do not take that book, then two magazines may be offered for 10c. For June: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures with Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for $1.25. Congregations should order supplies now, if needed.
◆ A few brothers have inquired about charter flights to assemblies in Bermuda, Hawaii and Europe this summer. The Society is NOT arranging for any charter flights, so brothers who desire to attend conventions in these places will have to make their own personal travel arrangements.

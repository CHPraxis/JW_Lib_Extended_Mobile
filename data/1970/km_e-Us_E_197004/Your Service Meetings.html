<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Theme: Succeed in Writing Living Letters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:2-47:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:2</a>. 3) Song 115.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong>Family discussion of text for the day and comments from “The Watchtower.” Family head then reviews with family what has been done by each family member in the ministry so far this month and makes sure that all have filled out a report slip for their service, to be turned in at next meeting. Bases comments on article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201970121/">Are You Writing a Letter?</a>” Also cover third paragraph of that main article. Highlight briefly each of the seven suggested avenues to new subscriptions, by means of experiences in the congregation, from “Yearbook,” or by demonstrations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>Suggested back-call, referred to in main article, “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201970121/">Are You Writing a Letter?</a>”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">(5 min.) Chairman gives talk based on first paragraph of main article.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">(5 min.) Publisher makes back-call on new subscriber. After the initial greeting, say: “You know, the attitude you expressed in our conversation last week impressed me. I really appreciated the interest and respect you had for the Bible thoughts we discussed. That’s why I thought you’d enjoy something in this ‘Truth’ book.” Hand him a book and have him turn to page 5. Ask him to read the first sentence. After he has, ask him, “Would you like to?” Repeat this with the next two questions, giving him opportunity each time to express himself. Now have him read the final sentence in paragraph one. Without getting answer, you could say, “For an answer to that question a notice question ‘a’ on the next paragraph.” Read it and let him find the answer. (Then proceed to consider with him the next few paragraphs to show him what hope the Bible gives. This the chairman could describe rather than demonstrate.) After making arrangements for your next call you might say. “If you would like to have that book for use at our next visit, we leave it for 25 cents.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman: This very simple and straightforward approach could be used with success when calling back on subscribers, or where magazines or books have been placed, or where no literature was taken but interest was shown.

Interview some local publishers who have magazine routes, asking how they succeeded in establishing a route. What appeals to local people? There is value to the people in having regular contact with Jehovah’s servants. If none have magazine routes yet, consider local possibilities of organizing some.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Presenting the “Mystery” Book.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman displays “Mystery” book. Comments about May campaign. In territories where people are somewhat familiar with Bible a publisher might do this:</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">(5 min.) Demonstrate: “Have you ever read the Bible book of Revelation? Many people have read it and wondered about the meaning of its numerous symbolic expressions. This book ‘Then is Finished the Mystery of God’ contains an interesting verse-by-verse consideration of much of this last book of the Bible and shows how other parts of the Bible help us to understand the book of Revelation. History and current events also play a part.” Open book and show how headings give verses under consideration on each page. Publisher could then say: “Chapter 24 is a very interesting one. This chapter tells what the book of Revelation says about God’s promises for the near future when a new system of things will be in operation here on the earth.” (Turn to page 368. Read the last paragraph on page 368 over onto page 369.)</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">(1 min.) Chairman explains that many other presentations can be used. Simplicity is important. Another presentation that might be used effectively in some territories includes opening the Bible to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">(5 min.) Demonstrate presentation: “Have you ever read the Bible book of Revelation? Note what <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 1:3</a> says.” Then after reading the scripture, the publisher might say: “God’s promise made here is that happiness comes to those who read the words of this prophecy and observe the things written in it. When and how does this occur? Now is God’s appointed time. The book of Revelation is a prophecy having its fulfillment in this century and it is very interesting to see how history and current events dovetail with prophecy written nearly 2,000 years ago. Therefore, all men on earth should desire to learn what is in the Bible and get in line for God’s blessings.” Then the publisher might turn to Chapter 24 and conclude as did the presentation outlined above. After placing book, publisher makes note on House-to-House Record.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">(7 min.) Chairman tells how publishers can plan to call back as soon as possible. Publisher can return with his own question booklet and explain how the book can be studied. In some cases it may be a good idea to invite the interested person to the regular congregation book study where the book is being studied. A question booklet can be placed with such persons to encourage them to prepare ahead of time. On the back-call publisher can talk to interested person and see what his interests are and decide whether to try to start the study using the “Mystery” book or the booklet that was placed or to bring out the “Truth” book and talk about some points in it. Give examples. It is important not to wait too long before calling back. Suggest one week should be the maximum.</p>

How Did We Do in February?
There were 170,929 new subscriptions obtained in February, compared with 155,048 last February. This makes a total of 362,171 for the first two months of the current “Watchtower” campaign. This is 61,232 more than last January and February​—an increase of 20 percent! It is evident there is much interest yet to be cared for in the little time remaining, is it not?
The total publisher figure of 365,886 represents a 7.2 percent increase over last February, only 158 publishers short of the all-time high peak in January of this year. And we have another new peak in pioneers, going over 15,000 for the first time.

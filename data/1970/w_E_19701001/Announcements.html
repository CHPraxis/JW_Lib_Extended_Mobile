<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>SOUNDING AN ALARM</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Sleep is a restorative. Yet sleep can destroy too! How? By inducing a lack of awareness when danger threatens. Can you recognize the danger signals around you in the world today? Are you aware of the signs that point to a sure end of this generation’s system of things? <em>Awake!, </em>companion magazine to <em>The Watchtower, </em>sounds the warning faithfully. It is interested in those events of our day that reveal the fatal course that mankind is taking. <em>Awake! </em>keeps thoughtful people awake to the real state of affairs and points them to the only remedy for world distress.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In sounding the alarm, <em>Awake! </em>does not seek to benumb with fright or promote consternation. It keeps its “feet on the ground” spiritually because it is governed by Bible principles. This gives its articles balance and impact. Said one <em>Awake! </em>reader: “Strong inner motivations and convictions force me to share the joy and satisfactions I derive from <em>Awake! </em>[Its] article ‘Four Aids for Good Health’ made an astonishing impression on me. The skillful interweaving of Scriptural backup in <em>all </em>the articles carries a very tremendous impact which I enjoy exceedingly and which brings renewed peace of mind and soul!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You, too, can enjoy <em>Awake! </em>regularly, by subscribing for it on an annual basis. A year’s subscription (24 issues), along with three timely booklets, is only $1. In their house-to-house ministry during October this offer will be presented by Jehovah’s witnesses. You can obtain it from them, or you may prefer to write to the publishers of this magazine. Your order for <em>Awake! </em>for one year will entitle you to the three booklets <em>God’s Way Is Love, Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon </em>and <em>When God Is King over All the Earth</em>.</p>

Appreciation for Bible Training by Parents
A YOUNG witness of Jehovah in Elwood, Indiana, greatly appreciated the Bible training she got from her parents. She tells why:
“When I was five years old, my parents began to study the Bible with me. At first I enjoyed it very much. But when I reached my early teens I began developing a rebellious attitude. For example, during the meetings at the Kingdom Hall I would sit with other children, look at the ceiling, pass notes and whisper. At this point my parents had me sit with them. Also they never gave up our family Bible study. Even though I would arrange other activities on the night of our study, they would always reschedule it so that our Bible study was held weekly.
“My parents zealously taught me the Bible’s basic truths in firmness and with love. In time they saw me outgrow my rebellious attitude and begin to show appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness. Today I am seventeen years old and I spend as much time as possible preaching Jehovah’s good news. I look forward to a life as a full-time preacher. All this because of my parents’ patient and loving training.
“I hope and pray that Jehovah God will forget my rebellious years. During all that time I knew deep down within me that my parents were right. So I would like to encourage all parents to continue their family Bible study with their children under all conditions, especially during rebellious years. This is when children need their parents most. Then one day they will hear their children say, ‘I am so thankful that my family regularly had a Bible study with me!’”

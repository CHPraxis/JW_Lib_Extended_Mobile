Something for All the Family!
Wholesome reading matter for all the family​—that is what you find in Awake! There is something for adults, something for children. There is something for the housewife, something for the breadwinner. Peoples and customs of many lands, the marvels of creation, articles of scientific interest and others of general interest​—all this is to be found in the pages of Awake!
Straightforward discussions of religious issues alert you in matters of concern to the whole family. Awake! offers instructive information and enjoyable reading for every member of the family. Why not send for your subscription now? One year [24 issues], only $1.

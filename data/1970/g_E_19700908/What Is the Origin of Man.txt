What Is the Origin of Man?
Does a computer evolve by itself from inanimate matter? Then, what about a living cell​—far more complicated than the most complex computer?
Did the living cell evolve by itself into a man? Sooner or later this question as to the origin of man confronts each one, especially students attending school. The Bible teaches that God created man and all kinds of life directly and not by any process of evolution. Has there been sufficiently strong evidence for evolution to render the Bible teaching obsolete?
Before you hastily answer, why not read a book that offers reliable answers to the questions: Is evolution a fact? Does it hold the key to mankind’s future? Read the thoroughly documented book DID MAN GET HERE BY EVOLUTION OR BY CREATION?

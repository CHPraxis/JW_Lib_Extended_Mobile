<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What can be done with older books on hand in the congregation literature supplies?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As a first suggestion, perhaps you would like to obtain some of these publications from your literature servant. If you have one or more with you in your witnessing case, you will find appropriate opportunities to offer them. When working in rural territory or other territory not often worked, you might choose to include one of these older publications in your offer. Feel free to do so.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It would be a fine thing, also, to encourage those on whom you are making back-calls and with whom you are conducting studies to read some of these older publications. Such reading will be of great benefit to them spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you are newly associated with Jehovah’s organization, how many of these older publications have you read? Check with your literature servant to see what publications are available. You may wish to add some of these to your library and read them as you have opportunity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:9-20:9:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 9:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Circuit servants can take note of congregations that have stocks of older books and make this information known to nearby congregations as they visit. Literature servants may feel free to inquire of nearby congregations and of their circuit servant too.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Congregation servants should use good judgment in ordering literature supplies. Do not guess in ordering. If you will check your progressive literature inventory to see how many of the same kind of books were placed during previous campaigns, you will be in a better position to determine how many will be needed for coming campaigns.</p>

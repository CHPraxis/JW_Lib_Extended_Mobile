<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Most outstanding is the fact that 9,941 were baptized during July, which brings the total baptized thus far for the service year to 38,021! How glad we are to have these newly dedicated ones associated with us. And how thankful we are to Jehovah that he has blessed us so richly in the disciple-making work.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The report shows also that 521,726 books were placed, which amounts to one or more placed by each of us, on the average. And 6,150,727 magazines were placed. If two magazines were placed at a time in most cases, it may be that we left literature in some three million homes in the one month of July! What a grand witness! As we continue to follow up the interest manifest, we pray that Jehovah will bless us in this work too.</p>

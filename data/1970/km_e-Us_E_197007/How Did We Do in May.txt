How Did We Do in May?
May was another wonderful month in the ministry in many ways. When the report was being tabulated in the office we thought for a while there would be another new peak, surpassing even April’s high point in publishers. While that did not occur, the total of 379,238 publishers continues to be well over our 10-percent goal for the year and it really makes our hearts rejoice to see your zeal and devotion to Jehovah. Also the average magazines placed per publisher, 14.5, and the average hours, 10.8, give some indication of the public’s desire to read information that really contains some hope for the future and of your zeal in making it available to them. Surely Jehovah has blessed us with grand privileges as we go on with our vital work of making disciples to His praise.

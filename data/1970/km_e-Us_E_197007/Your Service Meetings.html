<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"> <strong>5 min: </strong>Introduction, text and comments.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“Jehovah, an Awe-Inspiring yet Loving God.” Talk by mature brother highlighting Jehovah’s love and other marvelous qualities, based on article in March 15, 1970, “Watchtower.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201970241/">What a Loving Provider!</a>” Questions and answers.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Making the Most of Our Opportunities. Talk and demonstration.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman: Summer provides ideal time to have full share in field service. Why? There are more hours of daylight and we can extend witnessing into the evening, when most people are home from work and in a relaxed frame of mind. Many congregations need men to take lead. Why not call at time most favorable to get men interested in the truth. One brother who is an overseer and pioneer stated: ‘After supper the people are more relaxed. Women are not afraid to open the door, because their husbands are at home. In this way we are able to start studies with whole families and these can be held on Sunday or in the evening.’ He also remarked that the evening is ‘the best time for the ministry.’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">(6 min.) Two book study servants discuss evening witnessing. One discusses local obstacles and attitudes. Other patiently refutes arguments, pointing out people more receptive, man of house at home, find persons who seldom if ever have had a full opportunity to hear the good news, have realization of thoroughly covering territory by making not-at-homes in evening, may start study with entire families. An hour in evening may be worth two or three at other times. Evening hours produce placements, back-calls and Bible studies. Other brother begins to get enthusiastic as discussion continues. He finally decides to talk up evening witnessing at next book study. The two discuss how to have a share in evening witnessing.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman: Suggests working together in evenings where advisable. Any who cannot share in evening witnessing, yet want to spend more time in the field, may spend a full day in service from time to time. Organize according to local circumstances. Those taking care of midweek witnessing arrangements can encourage spending a full day in service. For example, if group spends two or three hours in house-to-house ministry in the mornings, why not spend another hour or two in the afternoons making not-at-homes, back-calls or conducting studies. Always enjoyable and mutually beneficial to get together with vacation and regular pioneers. Asks audience how many would like to try spending a full day in service if it were organized so that many could encourage one another. Suggests those handling midweek witnessing and book study servants arrange for groups to spend full day in service where possible.</p>

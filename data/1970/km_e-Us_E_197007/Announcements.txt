Announcements
◆ The “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly for Pittsburgh has been changed from the Three Rivers Stadium to Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dates remain the same.
◆ Literature offer for July: “Mystery” book and booklet (not the question booklet, but any booklet for general distribution to the public) on a contribution of 50 cents. August: Truth book on a contribution of 25 cents. September: Evolution book on a contribution of 25 cents.
◆ A supply of monthly report cards, magazine distributors’ order blanks and congregation field ministry charts is being sent out to each congregation. However, congregation servants should order regular pioneer supplies for the 1971 service year. Include 12 pink monthly report cards for each regular pioneer; also Weekly Record Sheets for those needing them. There is no need to order supplies for vacation pioneers, but be sure that you have application blanks on hand.
◆ A new circuit assembly program is scheduled to begin in September. We believe you will find it most informative and upbuilding. The public talk will be “Who Will Conquer the World in the 1970’s?”
◆ The public talk to be given by circuit servants starting September 6 is “Visiting the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” It includes the showing of eighty colored slides.

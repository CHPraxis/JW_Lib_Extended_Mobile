<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why is it beneficial for Kingdom Halls to have a mailbox?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Society receives general inquiries requesting the names and addresses of individuals, these are not supplied. However, the Kingdom Hall address is provided, with the suggestion that the individual write: Presiding Minister, c/​o Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It is necessary to treat the names and addresses in our files as confidential, since some organizations and individuals want this information for their mailing lists, and if they obtained it, it would result in the receipt of unwanted correspondence such as literature from apostates and advertisements.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is not unusual for brothers to write explaining that when they sent a letter to the Kingdom Hall address provided by the Society, it was returned by the postal authorities stamped “no mail receptacle.” And once more they ask how they can get in touch with the congregation servant. Recently a brother who wanted to serve where the need is greater wrote advising that he tried to find the Kingdom Hall but could not, because it had been relocated. As a result he decided to serve elsewhere. Such experiences illustrate the benefits of informing the Society before the Kingdom Hall address is changed and also of equipping the Kingdom Hall with some kind of mail receptacle, where this is possible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If your Hall does not have a mailbox at present, you may want to consider the advisability of obtaining one. The decision is one to be made locally. If you are not sure what would be acceptable to the postal authorities, you may check with them to ensure good mail service.</p>

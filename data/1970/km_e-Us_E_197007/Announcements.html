<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ A supply of monthly report cards, magazine distributors’ order blanks and congregation field ministry charts is being sent out to each congregation. However, congregation servants should order regular pioneer supplies for the 1971 service year. Include 12 pink monthly report cards for each regular pioneer; also Weekly Record Sheets for those needing them. There is no need to order supplies for vacation pioneers, but be sure that you have application blanks on hand.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Doubtless you have heard the claim that “the Bible conflicts with modern science and even contradicts itself.” But is it true? Have you investigated for yourself? Or, do you rely on “hearsay” on such important questions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Why not examine the matter yourself? Investigate the Bible, its claims, its prophecies, its standing in relation to modern science, and make your own decision. To aid you to do this we recommend the thought-provoking book of 192 pages, <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God? </em>This book together with an outstanding modern-English translation of the Bible is yours for $1.25. Send today.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me the book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God? </em>and the modern-language version, of the complete <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>I am enclosing, for both. $1.25.</p>

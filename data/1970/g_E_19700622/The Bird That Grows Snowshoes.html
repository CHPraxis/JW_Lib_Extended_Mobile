<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In autumn the ruffled grouse, a North American bird, will grow “snowshoes” to keep from sinking too deeply into the winter snow. Each toe of this bird was designed by its Maker to become fringed with flexible horny points. When the bird walks, these spread under his weight and provide the much-needed support.</p>

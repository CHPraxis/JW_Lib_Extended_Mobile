“Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way”
Mankind is imperiled. World famine, a rising tide of violence and nuclear catastrophe threaten the human race. “Wise men” see no way out. They have no real solutions. Can the human race be saved despite these looming perils? Yes, but there is only one way. Do not miss hearing the public address “SAVING THE HUMAN RACE​—IN THE KINGDOM WAY.”
That is the title of the feature talk at the 1970 “Men of Goodwill” District Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Be sure to attend, not only for this special feature, but also for the whole program, beginning at 1:40 Thursday afternoon and ending at 5:30 p.m. Sunday.

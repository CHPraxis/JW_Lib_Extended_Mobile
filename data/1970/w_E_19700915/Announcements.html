<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Scientific knowledge increases year by year. In fact, it takes but a few years for science textbooks to become outdated. Those that are one hundred years old may be filled with errors. Yesterday’s sober pronouncements may be dismissed today as mere speculations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then, what about the Bible, much of which was written more than 3,000 years ago? Not itself actually a book of science, when it does touch on scientific matters, is it out-of-date or up-to-date?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why not check the facts for yourself? True, you have doubtless heard people say, “Oh, the Bible conflicts with modern science.” But have they actually proved wrong any passages in which the Bible touches on scientific matters?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Surely you owe it to yourself to learn the facts. You can do so with the help of the enlightening book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God? </em>It is available in any of these sixteen languages:</p>

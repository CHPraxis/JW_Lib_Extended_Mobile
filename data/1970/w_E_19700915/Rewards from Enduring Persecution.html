<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In Nigeria a young witness of Jehovah had to attend a Catholic school, as only church-operated ones were in his area. He refused to attend catechism classes and for this he was frequently punished.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the course of time he was summoned before the whole school to be publicly whipped. But this incident only served to arouse sympathy for him from the other students. After a long period of faithfully enduring painful opposition, his conduct brought a change in the headmaster’s attitude. What resulted? The headmaster, his wife and three children all left their church and are now Jehovah’s witnesses. One of the students whom the young Witness helped to learn the Bible is now a full-time traveling minister of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p>

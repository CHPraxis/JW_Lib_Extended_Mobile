Valuable Service of Earthworms
Earthworms usually push through the soil, forming burrows. When the soil is hard, they may even eat their way through it, along with their usual diet of decaying vegetable matter. The soil and waste pass through the digestive canal and are deposited as castings. The burrows leave the soil full of pockets, so that both air and water can come through. The earthwormâ€™s castings build up soil fertility, as well as building up topsoil itself. It is said that earthworms can bring about ten tons of castings to the top of one acre of soil in just one year of activity.

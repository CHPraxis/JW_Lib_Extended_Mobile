<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Edwin W. Rice in his book <em>Ortentalisms in Bible Lands </em>observed that “it is quite keeping with Oriental politeness to accompany the departing guest a certain distance on the way . . . sometimes for several hours. This is a high type of politeness, and is called ‘bringing the guest on his way.’” The author then related the experience of a native Syrian who said, “When a person is going away, friends will go with him a few miles, and kiss at parting. . . . When I was leaving some Mt. Lebanon friends, they followed me for two hours until I was obliged to tell them that they must go no further.”</p>

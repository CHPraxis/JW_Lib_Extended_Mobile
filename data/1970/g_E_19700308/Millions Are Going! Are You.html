<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If you love freedom you will!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1969 2,719,860 were there!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On March 22, 1970, everything indicates, even more will attend. That is because each year more and more lovers of freedom are beginning to realize where only true freedom is to be found. The greatest Liberator of all times was Jesus Christ, who said: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:31-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:31, 32</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Free from what? From fear of man, from bondage to superstition, ignorance and false religion, from selfish ambition and corrupt practices and from the great enslaver, Satan the Devil.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But, why March 22, 1970? And go where?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This year, March 22 is the anniversary of the day that the great Liberator, Jesus Christ, established the festival memorializing his death. How fitting it is that Jesus’ disciples should come together annually in their Kingdom Halls to consider all he did for them and to commemorate his death, because it is through his death that all honest-hearted persons of the world can and will become a free people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:23-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">All readers of <em>Awake! </em>are invited to meet with the Christian witnesses of Jehovah as they gather in their Kingdom Halls on the evening of March 22 to celebrate this feast of liberation. Seats are free and no collection will be taken.</p>

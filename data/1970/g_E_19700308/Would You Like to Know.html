<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Would you like to know the “inner” meaning of the Bible? Especially the portion commonly called the “New Testament“? Since our English versions are only translations, sometimes the finer shades of meaning of the original language can be lost. Now you can read the “Christian Greek Scriptures” in one of the finest modern English translations, but you can, in addition, follow the original Greek with the exact word-for-word translation written between the lines. Now you can know the <em>exact </em>meaning of the original language of the Bible and make your own comparison with any other translation. An invaluable aid to the Bible scholar.</p>

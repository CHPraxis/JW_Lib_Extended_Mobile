<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>◆ </strong>In Nigeria a full-time preacher of Jehovah’s witnesses was witnessing in a village. Two young opposers decided to run ahead of him and hide so that when he passed they could jump out and beat him up. As they went down the road one of them dropped his purse. The Witness, following behind, picked it up and called out to the owner. On examining the purse, the owner found that all its contents were untouched. The two boys then told the Witness what their intentions were, but now they had changed their plan. Instead of beating the Witness up, the one who dropped his purse is now enjoying a Bible study conducted with him by the Witness.</p>

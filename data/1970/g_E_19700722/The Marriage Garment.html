<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An interesting custom that once prevailed in the Middle East throws light on Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:11-40:22:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:11-13</a>, where he speaks of wedding guests’ being given marriage garments. Before Western influence modified certain customs, travelers in Bible lands report that they were given marriage garments when they attended wedding feasts. These garments were long robes with loose sleeves to hang over their clothing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One native Syrian reports that the father of the bridegroom provided these garments that were made of inexpensive but gaily colored material. This was done in case any poor man came who did not have proper clothing to deck himself. If any guest failed to put this garment on, the governor of the feast could reprimand him.</p>

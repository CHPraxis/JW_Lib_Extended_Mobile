<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The branch office of Jehovah’s witnesses in Wiesbaden, Germany, received an interesting letter from a sixteen-year-old girl who wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“During my vacation I had the opportunity of visiting the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since most people usually speak adversely about Jehovah’s witnesses I was impressed with their friendliness and love; to state it briefly, with the unity of a big family. As far as your meetings are concerned they differ greatly from our church services. Your main topic of discussion is the Bible teachings, which are the focal point of all your meetings.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The songs that were sung are much prettier in rhythm than ours. I find the home Bible study very interesting. If we had anything like that we young people would no doubt be more interested in our religion. Especially the exactness with which one considers the Bible texts and happenings impresses me. It is not simply accepted and believed but rather carefully examined, whereas we get stranded on old ritual.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This young girl desired to learn more about Jehovah’s witnesses, so she attended the 1969 “Peace on Earth” Assembly.</p>

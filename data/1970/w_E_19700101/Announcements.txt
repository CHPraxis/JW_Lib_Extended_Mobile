FIELD MINISTRY
We are living at a time when many persons pride themselves on being well informed on important matters. However, despite the great strides made in scientific knowledge, the majority of the people have not been brought closer to God. To the contrary, we live in an age when the vast majority know very little about God and his loving purposes. How fitting it would be for such ones to acquaint themselves with God! (Job 22:21) Many fine provisions are available to help sincere persons who want to get acquainted with God. During the month of January those who are already acquainted with God will be extending the invitation to others to learn about his grand purposes by offering a year’s subscription for the Watchtower magazine, along with three booklets, for $1.
BETTER THAN FICTION!
An outstanding chapter in the historical drama of Jehovah’s witnesses and their preaching work has just been written into the record in the new 1970 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. And, as always, these scores of real-life adventures spell out a remarkable story. You will smile when you read what happened when a little girl followed a missionary to the house of a neighbor who was opposed to the Witnesses. But your heart will quicken at the experience of a Witness who was forced to share a cell with a cruel Russian bandit and that of a mother who turned all her family against her youngest son because he became one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Send for your copy. Only 50c. Send also for your 1970 calendar. Only 25c.

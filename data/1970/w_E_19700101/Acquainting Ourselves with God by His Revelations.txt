Acquainting Ourselves with God by His Revelations
Who had unique opportunities for getting acquainted with Jehovah God by means of awe-inspiring, miraculous visions of his glory?
The first servants of Jehovah God to be thus favored were Moses and Aaron his brother, Aaron’s two sons, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy representative older men of Israel; Moses further received an even more intimate vision of Jehovah. Later, similarly to be favored were the prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and the apostle John.​—Ex. 24:9-11; 33:17–34:7; Isa. 6:1-4; Ezek. 1:1-28; Dan. 7:9, 10; Rev. 4:1-11.a
What means has Jehovah provided for us to get acquainted with him?
The very ‘Book’ of visible creation helps us to get acquainted with our Creator, Jehovah God, in that it gives eloquent testimony regarding his power, wisdom and benevolence. But in particular does the revelation of himself in his inspired Word, the Holy Bible, help us to get acquainted with our God and Maker. Among other things it tells us of God’s unique name, Jehovah, and what his basic qualities or attributes are: love, justice, wisdom and power. It also tells us about his unique characteristics, such as his being the universal Sovereign, the Most High and King of eternity.
What effect should our getting acquainted with Jehovah by his revelations have upon us?
It should help us to grow in appreciation of Jehovah God. We should be able to pray to him with more accurate knowledge, with more freeness of speech and yet with befitting humility. We should be able to rely upon him with more confidence, “as seeing the One who is invisible.” (Heb. 11:27) And it should help us to make this only adorable God evermore a part of our daily experience.

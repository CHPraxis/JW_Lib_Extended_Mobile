<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword,” say the Holy Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) How vital it is to apply the effective principles of the Word of God in dealing with problems that arise in everyday living! In the troublesome and dangerous times in which we live, accurate knowledge from God’s Word enables us to come off victorious, “conquering the evil with the good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:21-45:12:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:21</a>) The <em>New World Translation </em>with its clear rendering facilitates the taking in of the needed accurate knowledge. And the book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God?  </em>builds up faith that the Bible is indeed inspired of God. In their house-to-house ministry during the month of June, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>along with the book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God? </em>for $1.25.</p>

Creation or Chance?
â—† A baby bird is equipped with a special tiny egg tooth on the tip of its bill to break its way out of its eggshell incubator. Having served its intended purpose, this tooth will drop off a few days later. Evolutionists claim that this handy tooth for the hatching birds was acquired by chance. However, thinking persons find it hard to believe that blind chance could discern the need for such a special tooth, arrange its unique design and formation, and then see to it that it would be discarded almost immediately after it served its obvious purpose.

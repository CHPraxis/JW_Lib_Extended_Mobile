Why the Moon Shines
● No doubt at night you have seen signs that reflect light. This is possible because the letters on these signs are coated with a layer of tiny glass beads a fraction of a millimeter in diameter. Then they are covered with plastic. When an automobile’s headlights shine on them they reflect the light.
Recent scientific research has revealed that man was not the first to use this type of light reflector. Evidence on the surface of the moon shows that the one who first utilized this reflective principle was the Creator of the universe.
Scientists, examining moon material brought back to earth by the astronauts, have found that as much as 50 percent of the moon’s “soil” is made up of glass. This glass is in different shapes. Some of it is perfectly round, elliptical, teardrop-shaped, or dumbbell-shaped. Also the glass ranges in size from tiny specks up to beads a millimeter (about 1/25 inch) in size.
The surfaces of these glass beads are very smooth. When a light is shined on them they are extremely lustrous. Dr. Wernher von Braun, prominent in United States spaceflight programs, wrote of them as “glistening in sunlight like light-reflecting glass beads in a highway sign.” While most of this glass is colorless, some of it is brown, yellow, red or green.
Even the moon’s rocks show that they were made to reflect light, for they are pitted with small glass-lined hollows. Some of them are covered with spattered drops of glass and appear as if they were glazed.
Further, in their moon walk, at the bottom of small craters the astronauts found glinting spangles in the form of glazed spots resembling splashes of molten solder. These were on rocks and on the soil.
How marvelously accurate is the statement at Genesis 1:16 in the Holy Bible where the moon is described as being a “luminary for dominating the night”!

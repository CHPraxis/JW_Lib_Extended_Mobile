Witnesses’ Bible Literature Impressed Him
● A retired college professor in Japan is employed by a large clothing company to teach the Bible and its morals to its employees. A missionary of Jehovah’s witnesses called on him, and he confessed to the missionary that those interested in the Bible often asked him questions that were hard to answer. The book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life was offered to him and he readily accepted it.
When the missionary called on him again he said: “I’d like to have five more copies of that book. I read it in bed the night I got it. I have never read a book that outlines the important points of the Bible and explains them understandably, as this book does. This is just what I need for some who are asking questions.”
Being a Greek scholar, he showed great interest in the Watchtower article on The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures. So impressed was he that he remarked, “The Watchtower really is taking the deep knowledge of the Bible to the common people, isn’t it? That’s where the churches have failed!”

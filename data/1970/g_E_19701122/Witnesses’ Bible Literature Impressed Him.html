<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A retired college professor in Japan is employed by a large clothing company to teach the Bible and its morals to its employees. A missionary of Jehovah’s witnesses called on him, and he confessed to the missionary that those interested in the Bible often asked him questions that were hard to answer. The book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>was offered to him and he readily accepted it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the missionary called on him again he said: “I’d like to have five more copies of that book. I read it in bed the night I got it. I have never read a book that outlines the important points of the Bible and explains them understandably, as this book does. This is just what I need for some who are asking questions.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Being a Greek scholar, he showed great interest in the <em>Watchtower </em>article on <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures. </em>So impressed was he that he remarked, <em>“The Watchtower </em>really is taking the deep knowledge of the Bible to the common people, isn’t it? That’s where the churches have failed!”</p>

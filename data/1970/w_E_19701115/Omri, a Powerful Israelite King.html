<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The Bible account regarding Israelite king Omri, the father of King Ahab, is very brief. It explains that he reigned for twelve years and built the city of Samaria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:16-11:16:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 16:16-28</a>) Other sources have been uncovered that indicate what a powerful ruler Omri was. In Assyrian records Palestine is called <em>Bit-Humria, </em>that is, House of Omri. Also, the discovery in 1868 of the now famous Moabite Stone reveals that King Omri subdued Mesha, the king of Moab, and showed his strength over Moab for some time. This information from the Moabite Stone further illuminates the Bible passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:3:4-12:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 3:4, 5</a>.</p>

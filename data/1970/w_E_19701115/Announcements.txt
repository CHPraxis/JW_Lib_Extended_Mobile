THE TRUTH ABOUT JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES
Do you want to know the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses? You may have wondered about their origin, why they call at the homes of people, the meaning of their name, the reasons for their rapid growth and why they have often been opposed. Many people are asking about these very matters. Dependable answers to such questions may be obtained in the book Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose.
This volume of 320 large pages offers a documented record of the beliefs and activities of the Witnesses. The story is not distorted by prejudice. It depicts the circumstances under which the Witnesses have sought to learn and put into practice the divine will, in favorable season and in troublesome season. Excellently illustrated, hardbound, this authentic history of Jehovah’s witnesses will be mailed to you for only $1.

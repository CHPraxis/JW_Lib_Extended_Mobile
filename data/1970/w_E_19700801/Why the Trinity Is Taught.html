<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ A woman in Reidsville, North Carolina, began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. After studying it only one month she called on her minister to ask him several questions, some dealing with the Trinity doctrine. Their conversation about the Trinity went like this:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Did the apostles teach the Trinity?” asked the woman.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“No,” replied the minister.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Then, did Jesus teach the Trinity?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“No,” answered the minister again.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Why, then, do you teach the Trinity?” she asked. The clergyman’s answer to this was that, since the church had adopted the teaching of the Trinity several centuries later, that was the reason why he taught it.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But the Bible says that ‘everyone that does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 John 9</a>.</p>

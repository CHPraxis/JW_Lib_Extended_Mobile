<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>TRUTH MEANS LIFE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Truth is precious, especially when it relates to the Word of God. So precious is it that the Bible says: “Buy truth itself and do not sell it​—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:23-20:23:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 23:23</a>) Can you imagine a space scientist trying to plot the path of a rocket to the moon on the basis of inaccurate or untruthful information from his electronic computers? How much more important is truth, then, in preparing our own course toward the goal of everlasting life!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But many persons do not ‘buy God’s truth’ even though the cost is only the effort required to learn it. Some may say that the Bible is difficult to understand; they may thus have put off learning the ‘holy writings that are able to make them wise for salvation.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:15</a>) Yet the life-giving truth of God’s Word can readily be learned. Would you like a brief, easy-to-understand presentation of what the Bible really teaches? Then obtain and read the invaluable pocket-sized book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</em>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To help truth seekers to gain this precious knowledge, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering this book in their house-to-house ministry during August. You can obtain a copy from them for only 25c. Or if you wish, you may order from the publishers of this magazine. The book will be sent to you postpaid.</p>

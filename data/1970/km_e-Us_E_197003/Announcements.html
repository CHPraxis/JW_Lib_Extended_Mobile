<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Regular pioneers serving since February 1, 1970, will be sent a cafeteria ticket with the March 15 pioneer letter for use at a district assembly during this service year.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ Congregation servants and pioneers: It will help us considerably if all pioneer reports are sent no later than the third day of the month and if the pioneer’s name (as listed with the Society) and address appear legibly.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ Offer for May: <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God,” </em>with one booklet, for 50c. In making up orders for this book, congregation servants and literature servants can check movement of other 50c publications used in recent campaigns so that they will have enough for the publishers but not be overstocked.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ If overseers act immediately, there will still be time to order an increased supply of the special April 15 <em>Watchtower </em>and the special April 22 <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">◆ There is still time for the overseer, if he feels it is appropriate, to arrange for those interested in vacation pioneer service during April to get together at a convenient time to discuss their plans. This will afford them an opportunity to work out arrangements among themselves and for the overseer to schedule group witnessing, if necessary, and otherwise offer assistance.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">◆ Overseer should promptly mail Memorial report card after special public talk on March 29.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">◆ The Society still has a good supply of the 1970 <em>Yearbook </em>and calendar. Determine your immediate needs and order right away. They are an excellent means by which to acquaint Bible students with Jehovah’s organization.</p>

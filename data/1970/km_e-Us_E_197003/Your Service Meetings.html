Note, we are talking not only about “inviting” them to Kingdom Hall but “getting” them there. Have brief introduction and conclusion so as much time as possible can be spent on experiences themselves. Be sure to apply main point in experience so it stands out. Applies also to getting them to Memorial and special talk.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Concluding comments. Make final comments regarding Memorial on Sunday.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"> <strong>5 min: </strong>Introduction, text and comments.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong>Presenting the Good News​—“Become ‘Intensely Occupied with the Word.’” Discuss with audience. Chairman can comment on some paragraphs and ask questions on others. Be sure to emphasize the point that we need to make good use of our time. If studies are not progressing, then publishers should engage in the house-to-house work. Magazine-territory servant might be called on to give brief, up-to-date report on territory coverage. If covered often, stress need for thorough coverage. Can interview congregation publisher or pioneer who obviously enjoys house-to-house work and is effective therein.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"> <strong>8 min: </strong>Question Box. Possibly congregation servant can discuss this with others on committee.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>“What Are You Doing About What You Have Learned?” This material, in March 1, 1970, “Watchtower,” will be helpful to those with whom we are conducting home Bible studies. Encourage brothers to bring “Watchtower” with them to this meeting. Present as talk, but draw brothers into discussion occasionally. Demonstrate briefly how material might be used to get student to appreciate what he is learning.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Make this positive and upbuilding, not negative. Use it to get students to progress and act; although, if no progress results, we will spend time more profitably in house-to-house work. Paul became intensely occupied with the word, meaning preaching and teaching. They should be progressing toward that end too. Maybe if we get them to meetings in March, the study need not be discontinued.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Concluding comments. Should have outstanding attendance at special talk next Sunday. All publishers and interested persons should be there. If some were at Memorial, then they are already acquainted with many. If not, an excellent time to invite interested ones for first time. Progress to date on subscription campaign. Song 46.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>“What Do You Want Out of Life?” Discuss article in February 1, 1970, “Watchtower.” Best if young publishers can handle this. Mature brother can be assigned to help and rehearse however. He must study material well and be acquainted with it. Young brother might introduce discussion with 3- or 4-minute talk. Other young publishers on platform can be quizzed on part of material, have round-table discussion on part, or just discuss how they feel points helped them to get solid view of proper goals for future. Important thing is for young publishers to see value of points made and how it applies to them.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"> 8 <strong>min: </strong>Youthful Publishers Succeed by Faithfulness in the Ministry. 1970 “Yearbook” experiences, p. 128, par 1; p. 178, par. 1. Have very brief introduction and conclusion. Spend time relating or reading experiences and highlighting thought that young publishers have shown they can shoulder responsibility, witness to others effectively, maintain integrity.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>“Do You Make Yourself Available?” Material from February 1, 1970, “Watchtower.” Be sure to tie this in with the two assignments above.

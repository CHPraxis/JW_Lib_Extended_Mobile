How Did We Do in January?
Jehovah has again richly blessed our work. Last November’s peak of 364,320 was bettered when 366,044 reported! Regular pioneers increased to 14,983 for another new peak! Obviously Jehovah’s servants want to have a share in the work yet to be done.
And how are we doing in the subscription campaign? We obtained 191,242 subscriptions​—the best January ever, by 44,605.
Did you notice the Bible study average? We are back up to .7 again, and this is the best since last May. Keep up that fine building work.

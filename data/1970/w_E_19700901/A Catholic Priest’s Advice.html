<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In Poland a man went to his priest to inquire as to how he should deal with his mother, who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He was very much surprised when the priest frankly told him: “Take your stand with your mother as quickly as you can because that is the only true way.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Upon learning this, the son agreed to have the Witnesses conduct a home Bible study with him, his wife and his son. It is being held twice a week.</p>

She and the Children Had Changed!
A GREEK family moved to South Africa. While there the wife became very interested in the Bible’s message of truth as presented by Jehovah’s witnesses. Not much later she and her children had to return to Greece to help her sick parents. Before she left, her husband stressed to her that the children were to be brought up in the Orthodox church. While in Greece, however, the woman continued her study of the Bible and made rapid progress in her knowledge of its teachings. Glowing letters about what she was learning now began reaching her husband. So he decided to return to Greece “to put a stop to this whole business before it gets too far.”
Upon his arrival there, he was met by a very happy family that had made great changes. Whereas his wife was formerly an incorrigible gossiper and troublemaker, he found that she was now liked and respected by all. And his children, who had been so unmanageable, had now become most respectful. Needless to say, he was pleasantly surprised by all this. Nevertheless, he felt that he still had to put his wife right about her religion.
So, taking her Bible, off he went to the village church to note the differences between it and the one in the church. He found no differences. In fact, in his investigation he found the name Ieova (Jehovah) in the church Bible, and he wondered why the priest had never mentioned it. He returned home very thoughtful. “This religion of yours is good,” he said to his wife. “I know now that you will always be faithful to me as a wife and that my children are better than they have ever been. You continue in this religion and give me something to read.” He then returned to South Africa, where he, too, began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A new Bible version, <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, </em>enables you to do just that​—to read between the lines of the original Greek in which the commonly called <em>“New Testament” </em>was written. This enables you to have an accurate, exact understanding of the text as it is written in the Greek. In addition, in a parallel column, there is a smooth modern-language translation that aids you in grasping the full meaning. Send for this fine edition. Only $2.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When a building is constructed, diligent effort is exerted to make certain that there is a good foundation. Likewise a solid, right kind of foundation is necessary on which to build Christian faith. Thus what Jesus Christ taught and did for us serves as the primary foundation for true faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 2:20</a>) Ever since this journal was first published in 1879, <em>The Watchtower </em>has endeavored to help others build upon this right spiritual foundation. To build up faith in others during the month of March, Jehovah’s witnesses will happily offer a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>along with three booklets, for $1.</p>

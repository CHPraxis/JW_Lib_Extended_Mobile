READ BETWEEN THE LINES
A new Bible version, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, enables you to do just that​—to read between the lines of the original Greek in which the commonly called “New Testament” was written. This enables you to have an accurate, exact understanding of the text as it is written in the Greek. In addition, in a parallel column, there is a smooth modern-language translation that aids you in grasping the full meaning. Send for this fine edition. Only $2.
FIELD MINISTRY
When a building is constructed, diligent effort is exerted to make certain that there is a good foundation. Likewise a solid, right kind of foundation is necessary on which to build Christian faith. Thus what Jesus Christ taught and did for us serves as the primary foundation for true faith. (Eph. 2:20) Ever since this journal was first published in 1879, The Watchtower has endeavored to help others build upon this right spiritual foundation. To build up faith in others during the month of March, Jehovah’s witnesses will happily offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.

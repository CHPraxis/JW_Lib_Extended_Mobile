WHAT HOPE FOR FREEDOM?
At no other time in man’s history has there been such a universal cry for freedom, freedom from political, social, even religious, “slavery.” However, “freedom marches,” protest demonstrations, organized programs of civil disobedience often succumb to violence and radical extremists who would overturn all that is old and long established. Even those who try to remain neutral and keep their independence are hemmed in, cramped by the pressures exerted from both sides. Is there a solution? Is there a realistic hope for enslaved mankind?

FIELD MINISTRY
“The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword,” say the Holy Scriptures. (Heb. 4:12) How vital it is to apply the effective principles of the Word of God in dealing with problems that arise in everyday living! In the troublesome and dangerous times in which we live, accurate knowledge from God’s Word enables us to come off victorious, “conquering the evil with the good.” (Rom. 12:21) The New World Translation with its clear rendering facilitates the taking in of the needed accurate knowledge. And the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? builds up faith that the Bible is indeed inspired of God. In their house-to-house ministry during the month of June, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Recently a clergyman in Brooklyn, New York, obtained a copy of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. </em>He was so impressed with the chapter dealing with prayer that he used the book to teach members of his church this chapter in a special meeting. Later he was asked by one of them, “Are you teaching us out of those Jehovah’s witnesses’ books?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">He replied: “It is the truth, isn’t it? When you want Sunday-school literature, you buy it from several sources, don’t you? Well, Jehovah’s witnesses teach the truth. Furthermore, when you see Jehovah’s witnesses with the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine, you ought to buy it, because they print the truth.”</p>

Public Bible Meetings
THE public Bible-education meetings that Jehovah’s witnesses sponsor play an important role in preaching the good news of God’s established kingdom. In this way thousands have been helped to appreciate God’s purpose for the earth and mankind. Illustrating the value of public meetings is the following experience:
“After my first home Bible study with an interested woman, I described a new series of public Bible lectures that we were having in our Kingdom Hall. I gave her a handbill that listed the titles of those that were scheduled to be delivered in the next several weeks. A few weeks later this interested woman asked me whether Jehovah’s witnesses were as critical toward other religions as people said they were. I suggested in my answer to her that she come to the Kingdom Hall and hear the lecture that was scheduled that week. She came.
“She was so impressed with what she heard that she told me that she was going to sever all connections with her church. I invited her to another talk and told her that each lecture dealt with an interesting and timely subject. She said that, since she was not going to the other church anymore, she would attend, and she did just that.
“For several Sundays she came alone, but then her husband began to come with her. He had been invited before, but he had decided against studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. After his hearing just two lectures he asked his wife to have my husband come and study the Bible with him. Now the two of them never miss a Sunday meeting and they are both progressing well in their home Bible studies.”

A Clergyman Uses the “Truth” Book
◆ Recently a clergyman in Brooklyn, New York, obtained a copy of the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. He was so impressed with the chapter dealing with prayer that he used the book to teach members of his church this chapter in a special meeting. Later he was asked by one of them, “Are you teaching us out of those Jehovah’s witnesses’ books?”
He replied: “It is the truth, isn’t it? When you want Sunday-school literature, you buy it from several sources, don’t you? Well, Jehovah’s witnesses teach the truth. Furthermore, when you see Jehovah’s witnesses with the Watchtower magazine, you ought to buy it, because they print the truth.”

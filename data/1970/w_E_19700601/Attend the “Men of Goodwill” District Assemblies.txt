Attend the “Men of Goodwill” District Assemblies
AS A reader of The Watchtower and a lover of Bible truth you may very well be one of a great crowd of persons on earth today toward whom Jehovah God is manifesting his goodwill. For all who desire God’s approval the “Men of Goodwill” District Assemblies are provided by the Watch Tower Society. Indeed, you are herewith invited to begin making your plans now to be present​—you and your family.
Herein is provided a complete and revised list of these assemblies, giving location and an address to which you may send your request for rooming accommodations at the city where you will attend. English will be the language used at each assembly location unless otherwise stated.
The program will commence at 1:40 p.m. Thursday and conclude at 5:30 p.m. Sunday. Friday morning is the time scheduled for the baptism.
From the very start the program will provide stirring, faith-strengthening information. This is why we strongly recommend that you plan to get to the assembly city well before noon of the opening day. You will thus have time to get settled and be in your place in the audience at 1:40 p.m.
We rejoice that Jehovah God is kindly extending his goodwill to an increasing multitude of persons in these days. Why, in the past year and a half over 170,000 persons world wide submitted to water baptism, thus testifying to their dedicating of their lives to God. Portions of the program are particularly designed to help new ones to appreciate the organization that Jehovah is using as well as to make progress on the way to life.
Special features are included on the program that will be of benefit to parents and young people. Also a delightful Bible drama will be presented, offering Biblical as well as modern settings. And a high point at each assembly will be the public lecture Sunday afternoon: “Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.”
Those who have attended the district assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in the past need no urging to be present. They know they can count on learning many things. They eagerly look forward to associating with a great crowd of persons who have much in common because of their love for God and his righteous ways.
Reasonably priced rooming accommodations are generally available. Good, nourishing meals are provided at the assemblies at very small cost. But most important, all will have the advantage of good association during the assembly days and will hear from the platform excellent counsel on how to cope with the problems of life in this wicked world.
Consult the following list, therefore, and not earlier than five weeks before the assembly date send your application for room accommodations. We look forward to greeting you at the assembly.

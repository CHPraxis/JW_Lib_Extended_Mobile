<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On October 1, 1969, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania had its annual meeting at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at its registered office, 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213. N. H. Knorr, its President, presided at the meeting and at 9:50 called on George M. Couch to bring to the attention of all present, a total of 2,376, the text for the day, as well as to give comments on it. At 10 a.m. the annual meeting was called to order and Brother Curtis A. Smith opened the meeting with prayer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As was reported in last year’s <em>Yearbook, </em>there were 481 members in the Pennsylvania corporation. However, the Secretary and Treasurer, Grant Suiter, reported that ten died or resigned, making the membership as of October 1, 1969, 471. It was reported by the Secretary that 461 persons were present in person or by proxy so that there was a quorum to handle the Society’s business. One of the matters to be taken care of was the election of directors for three vacancies occasioned by the expiration of terms of M. G. Henschel, N. H. Knorr and L. A. Swingle. All of these individuals were renominated and were reelected by unanimous vote for a term of three years. After the election of these directors the President of the Society called on Brother Abrahamson of Denmark, Brother Piccone of Morocco and Brother Rosam of Canada, to give reports on their respective countries, as these three members of the corporation were present in person from foreign lands. They gave excellent reports on their countries and what was happening. This was enjoyed by all. Following these reports there were greetings read from all parts of the world. This was handled by Grant Suiter. Then followed a talk by the President of the Society on the subject “Go . . . Make Disciples . . . Baptizing Them.” This talk was greatly appreciated by all in attendance. The information will be published in the December 15, 1969, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>in English. Then followed further comment on the work world wide, along with some very interesting experiences. The annual meeting adjourned shortly after midday. The meeting was closed with prayer by the President of the Society.</p>

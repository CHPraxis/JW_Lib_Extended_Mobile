How Did We Do in September?
September was the month we concentrated on offering the “Evolution” book throughout the territory and in the schools. The brothers did excellently, placing 922,199 books. This number is second only to August of 1969 when we placed 936,913 and the offer was the “Truth” book. What a testimony was given to the fact of creation by Jehovah as against the theory of evolution!

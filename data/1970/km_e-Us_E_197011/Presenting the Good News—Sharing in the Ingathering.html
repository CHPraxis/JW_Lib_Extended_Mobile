<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The outstanding numerical increases that have taken place world wide in the theocratic organization in recent years have been a stimulus and encouragement to all of us. Jehovah is surely fulfilling his promise to bring into his earthly organization those who love the truth. But how many disciples have you personally made recently? It could be few or none at all. After all, when we average out the number of persons that come into the organization in one year, there are not very many in each congregation. Even then, one publisher might help an entire family to learn the truth, so only one or two publishers in a certain congregation have this joy of starting new publishers in the field ministry. How, then, is it possible for the rest of us to have any share in the ingathering?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Most of us have a part in the house-to-house work. We present the various literature offers. We distribute the magazines. Not only do we leave literature explaining the Bible but we have Scriptural discussions. We leave a good impression.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Additionally, when Witness families set a good example in Christian conduct this is observed by neighbors. The father who shoulders his responsibilities in a fine way is respected at his place of secular employment and in the community. When the mother is diligent in carrying out her duties in the household and when the children are obedient, loving and law-abiding in school, at home and in the neighborhood, the neighbors come to know it. This is a living witness to them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>So, after a time a publisher calls at a home in the regular house-to-house work and there is interest and a study can be started and rapid progress is made. Who is to receive the credit? Actually, as we have seen, many in the congregation have contributed. And, can we overlook the part the angels have played? Finally, who really makes it grow?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Then there comes the time when the interested one attends his first meeting. This is a critical point in his advancement. If you are the publisher bringing him to the Kingdom Hall, what thoughts are now going through your mind? Well, you hope that many of the publishers will be there early so you can introduce him to some of them before the meeting. You hope they will all show their usual friendliness, not being too occupied with other things. You hope that the brothers and sisters with assignments on the Ministry School will be very well prepared and give clear, understandable, enthusiastic talks. You hope that the brothers who have service meeting parts are thoroughly prepared and will present instructive, helpful material. If it is the public talk, you hope that the brother does well, with the best of material and a poised, conversational delivery. For the <em>Watchtower </em>study you hope that the publishers’ response will be quick and their comments enlightening and upbuilding.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Why do you hope for these things? Because you want the publishers and the program to help you in assisting your student to make progress. Have you ever sat through a meeting, knowing that someone new was in the audience and listened to the program “through his ears”? What a satisfied feeling you had when the program was outstanding!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>So we all can share in assisting new ones. In fact, it is a responsibility we cannot escape. When each member of the congregation plays his part, all share in the ingathering.</p>

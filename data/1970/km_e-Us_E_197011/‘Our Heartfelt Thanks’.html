<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This is what our Peruvian brothers in the earthquake area are saying to Jehovah and his organization for all the things sent to them. A call for clothing went out to the congregations in New York city. Out of the 20,000 pounds of clothing that arrived duty free, there was enough for all the brothers and sisters and their children in the earthquake area. Exclamations such as these were heard: “How loving on the part of our brothers!” “Our brothers have stripped themselves just to cover us!”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Money contributions sent to Peru from brothers in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and other lands totaled about $3,000. This was in addition to the $20,000 made available by the Society. This relief fund is enabling the brothers to get what they need.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The material aid sent to our brothers in Peru has impressed many outsiders. As various items piled up in front of the ruins of a Kingdom Hall, a neighbor commented: “I understand that you people don’t pay tithes, and yet your organization brings you all these things so quickly. We pay tithes in our church and nobody even remembers us.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Our brothers in Peru are deeply grateful. As the branch servant reports: “From the very first it was the promptness on the part of the brothers that impressed and encouraged the stricken ones. The indescribable gift of help and the fruitage of love sent to the brothers in Peru has had the desired effect, for the time spent in the ministry among the brothers in the earthquake zone has not diminished one iota. To the contrary, all activity has increased.” A fine way indeed to express heartfelt thanks!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How many copies of “Kingdom Ministry” should a congregation receive?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Kingdom Ministry” is not for general distribution. As the name implies, it contains help and encouragement for those who share in the field ministry. The congregation should receive enough copies of “Kingdom Ministry” so that all who qualify can have one. How is the figure arrived at? Add the total number of publishers, regular and irregular, to the number of pioneers associated with the congregation. To this add the names of all others who attend the service meetings with some regularity and who give indication that they want to share in the field ministry and are making some progress in that direction. There should be one for the Theocratic Ministry School library and one for the congregation file kept by the congregation servant, in addition to the congregation servant’s personal copy. This total is then rounded off to the next multiple of eight, inasmuch as “Kingdom Ministry” is sent in groups of eight, and this makes copies available to care for growth in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some congregation servants have found it advantageous to have a list of those who qualify to receive a copy of “Kingdom Ministry.” When the month’s supply arrives, the names of these persons are written neatly on their copies and distributed to them through the book study servants. A brother who sets a good example in the congregation can be assigned to assist in this. In this way each one is assured of getting his copy. Knowing that extra copies for replacement are not available, each one should take care of the one provided for him. Many publishers find it useful to save “Kingdom Ministry” for future reference.</p>

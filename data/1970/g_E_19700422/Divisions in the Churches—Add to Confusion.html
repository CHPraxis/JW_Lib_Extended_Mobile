<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE changes in the churches have caused confusion among both clergy and laity. Yet, other things that have not changed are also causing as great, or even greater confusion!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One such is the birth-control issue in the Roman Catholic Church. This teaching has not changed for decades. But this very fact is causing division.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another issue in the Catholic Church is whether priests should be free to marry. In recent years increasing numbers of them have been asking for a change in the Church’s law on celibacy.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Then there are doctrinal matters. Clergymen of all religions are disagreeing with the teachings of their own church and are demanding changes.</p>

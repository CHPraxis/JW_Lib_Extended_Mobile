<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Competition, the need or desire to gain an advantage, often leads to practices that are not in your best interests. In the field of entertainment, for example, one extreme has led to another in an effort to capture the attention of the audience, with the result that many who have spent their lives in the field are withdrawing because of the extent of obscenity that has been reached. In business, too, quality is often sacrificed to meet the demands of the highly competitive market. So it is that more and more periodicals are turning to sensational matters to maintain their circulations.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Not so, however, with <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>From their first issues, circulation has always been placed second to their primary purpose, that of bringing to you information of the highest value. This dedicated interest in providing you with truth, regardless of what others may do, has maintained the standard of these publications despite the changing times.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">And what has been the result? Have their circulations suffered? On the contrary, both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>have now passed the six million mark for each issue!</p>

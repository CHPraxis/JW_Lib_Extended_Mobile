Divisions in the Churches​—Add to Confusion
THE changes in the churches have caused confusion among both clergy and laity. Yet, other things that have not changed are also causing as great, or even greater confusion!
One such is the birth-control issue in the Roman Catholic Church. This teaching has not changed for decades. But this very fact is causing division.
Another issue in the Catholic Church is whether priests should be free to marry. In recent years increasing numbers of them have been asking for a change in the Church’s law on celibacy.
Then there are doctrinal matters. Clergymen of all religions are disagreeing with the teachings of their own church and are demanding changes.

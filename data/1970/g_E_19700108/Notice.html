<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ARE you one of the thousands of persons disappointed by the materialistic trend of most religions? or by the internal dissension, the disagreement among church leaders as to what the members of their own flocks should be taught, or what they should be “permitted” or “not permitted” to do according to their “articles of faith”? Are you disheartened or disillusioned by the number of churchmen who are teaching that “God is dead”?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So severe has been the reaction to the position taken by church leaders that thousands of former staunch church members no longer find satisfaction in continuing their association. But many of these sincere people still feel a desire to worship God. They are among those the apostle of Jesus said are seeking God “if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Are you one of these? If so, then take hope! Never before in man’s history has knowledge of God’s purpose for mankind been so advanced. Never before has it been possible for us to see so clearly what the immediate future holds. And one of the outstanding evidences of this is the very serious failure of the churches to supply the spiritual strength people need to face this modern world’s changing and corrupting moral standards.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A real champion of God’s Word, the Holy Bible, and of God’s kingdom that will restore God’s rightful place in the hearts of men is <em>The Watchtower. </em>For ninety years this faithful journal has been pointing forward to this very time, urging people to turn to the Bible because of the spiritual famine that the Bible itself foretold was to come in our generation.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Now that famine is here! But you can escape it and enjoy spiritual food in abundance. Will you take advantage of it? It could be the turning point in your life. Send for and read</p>

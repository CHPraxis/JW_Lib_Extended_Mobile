“All Sorts of Men . . .”
Jesus told the leaders of his day that all kinds of men were responding to his message, even though they themselves were not. Today, the experiences of “all sorts of men” heeding the “good news” being preached by Jehovah’s witnesses would fill a book. In fact, they do​—the 1970 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. For example, read what effect God’s truth had on a film actress, a “carnival queen,” a professional musician, “hippies,” a matador and a landlady whose boardinghouse was used for prostitution. Send for your copy today. Only 50c. Send also for the 1970 calendar, only 25c.
Please send me [ ] 1970 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses (each, 50c); [ ] 1970 calendar (each, 25c). I am enclosing ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐.

Determined to Learn
During a time when there was a scarcity of copies of the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, a witness of Jehovah in Ohio began studying the Bible with her neighbor. The Witness had only her copy of the Truth book to use. So she would lend the book to this interested neighbor in order for her to prepare her lessons. This went on for some time. Finally the neighbor borrowed the book for several days. When the Witness came to her home to conduct the study, she was amazed to find that this woman had hand copied much of the Truth book along with the questions so she could have her own book to study until copies would once again be available. Truly, she was determined to learn Godâ€™s truth.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Textbooks in many schools and colleges teach the evolution theory as though it were proved fact. A whole generation of students has been taught that there is no other explanation of the source of human life. Said one school principal: “You know, we have a library of over 10,000 books but not one of them gives the other side of the evolution theory.” In view of this imbalance, he accepted a publication that gives the other side. You too can have this information, for if is found in the thought-provoking book <strong>DID MAN GET HERE BY EVOLUTION OR BY CREATION? </strong>A copy will be sent to you postpaid, for only 25c.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I am enclosing 25c. Please send me the 192-page book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</em></p>

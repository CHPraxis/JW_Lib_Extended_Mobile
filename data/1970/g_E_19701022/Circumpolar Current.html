<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of the major ocean currents of the world is that which encircles the Antarctic Continent called the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. It has a breadth ranging from several hundred to 1,000 kilometers and is being compared in volume flow to the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current. Studies disclose that the current transports an estimated 270,000,000 cubic meters of water per second, twice the previously estimated amount and nearly three times that of the Gulf Stream.</p>

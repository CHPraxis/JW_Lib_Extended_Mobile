<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A water molecule is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. When hydrogen and oxygen are combined to form water, considerable energy is released. If 1.1 pounds of pure hydrogen were combined with 8.9 pounds of pure oxygen to form water, enough energy would be given off to burn a 60-watt electric light bulb for 325 hours. Fuel cells utilizing this reaction have been produced and used in some spacecraft.</p>

‘No Time to Read the Bible’
◆  A mother in Arizona began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. After a while she was confronted by her Baptist minister. She tried to use the Bible to support her newly acquired knowledge, but the clergyman kept saying, “That is just a figure of speech.” Finally she asked him if he even believed the Bible. He replied, “A person does not have time to read the Bible anymore!” Then he left.

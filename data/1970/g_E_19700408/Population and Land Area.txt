Population and Land Area
In the Brooklyn Public Library News Bulletin of April 1969 a question was asked about the percentage of land that is utilized by the urban population in the United States. The answer was given as follows:
“According to the text in the 1960 Census of Population, ‘Urban population which constituted nearly 70 percent of the total population was concentrated in slightly more than 1 percent of the land area of the country.’”

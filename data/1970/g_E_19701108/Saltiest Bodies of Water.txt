Saltiest Bodies of Water
● The Dead Sea, lying at the end of the Jordan River between Israel and Jordan, is one of the two saltiest bodies of water on earth. It is about six times as salty as ocean water and contains about 24 percent solid matter, mostly salt. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is the other body of water comparable in salt content.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ A college student in Japan was brought up in a family that worshiped the Buddhist god Jizo, guardian deity of children. This student was surrounded by images, for his father is a stonecutter, engaged principally in chiseling out Jizo “gods.” His older brother received a gift subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine from a former friend who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. But it was he, the younger brother, who eagerly read and reread the magazines.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Witness called at their home later, this young man eagerly accepted the free six-month course of Bible study offered him by the Witness. By the end of four months, the young man made a complete break from the lifeless Jizo and his fellow gods of stone, and he was telling others about the living God, Jehovah, in the door-to-door Christian ministry.</p>

Whip the Tension Habit
‚óè People complain of tension, but they fail to realize it is not the job that is tense, but they are. They must come to grips with their jobs. It is always well to tackle one job at a time. Work off tension with physical activity, or by doing something relaxing. Be more tolerant of others, less critical. Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating properly? When something disturbs you, talk it over with a friend. Share your burdens. These suggestions often put things in the right perspective and rid one of that awful habit of being tense.

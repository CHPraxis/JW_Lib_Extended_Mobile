<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What is the meaning of today’s world without faith? Why are so many without faith in God and the Bible? Why have the churches failed to build faith? What can you do to help yourself and others to have the kind of faith it takes for survival in these critical times?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You will be delighted to find the answers to those questions in the revealing book <strong>IS THE BIBLE REALLY THE WORD OF GOD?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among others you will enjoy these faith-building chapters: “Genesis Account of Creation​—Fact or Fiction?” “Was There an Earth-wide Flood?” “The Bible and Ancient History​—Do They Agree?” “Are the Miracles of the Bible True?” “Does the Bible Contradict Itself?” “Do Christendom’s Churches Represent the Bible?”</p>

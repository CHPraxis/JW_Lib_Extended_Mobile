<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A fifteen-year-old boy who is a witness of Jehovah in Canada wanted to attend the “Peace on Earth” Assembly in 1969. But his family could not finance his trip. Being determined to attend the assembly, he decided to earn the necessary money himself. Thus, three months in advance he began his assembly project​—collecting scrap metal and selling it. So during all his spare time, after school and on weekends, he was busy looking for scrap, cleaning it and then transporting it on his small wagon to the local scrap dealer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although this took much of his time, he never neglected his study of the Bible or failed to go out in the preaching work regularly. At the end of three months, this fifteen-year-old Witness had sold 708 pounds of aluminum, 187 pounds of babbitt, 140 pounds of copper, 245 pounds of stainless steel and 27 pounds of other miscellaneous metal.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the sale of all this scrap metal he earned more than enough money to finance his trip to the assembly. And he generously assisted some Witnesses who are full-time preachers in his locality. His fine, unselfish attitude was greatly blessed by Jehovah God and he enjoyed the assembly to the full.</p>

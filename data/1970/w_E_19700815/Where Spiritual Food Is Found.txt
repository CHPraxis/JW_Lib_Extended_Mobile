Where Spiritual Food Is Found
ONE of Jehovah’s witnesses in Portland, Oregon, had this experience with a woman who accepted the publication The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life: The woman agreed to study the Bible and after a while wanted to study it twice a week. As she studied, the woman said to the Witness: “I am beginning to be convinced that this is the truth because this is the first religion I’ve ever known that is not patting you on the back and saying, ‘you’re doing all you can do.’ I’ve read the Bible enough to know that true Christianity is a hard way of life with many trials and tests.”
After some time passed, this woman began attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and she commented: “I have always known that there was too much pomp and ceremony in the churches today for them to be like the early Christians.” Yes, the simplicity of the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses impressed her.
However, her husband began opposing her association with the Witnesses at their meetings. He promised her that if she would give this up they would go to church as a family. Well, the woman agreed to do this. And after just two weeks had passed, she called the Witness and was crying. She said: “I went to church for food and I was handed crumbs. Your religion screams ‘truth, truth,’ because it was when I was studying the Bible with you people that I was persecuted for the first time in my life for religion. And I never came home feeling starved like I am now.”​—2 Tim. 3:12; 4:1-4.
She began attending the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses once again and is now sharing with others the things she is learning. She rejoices to be where spiritual food is to be found.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How long have you been a serious student of the Bible? A few months, or a few years? If so, then you still have wonderful new vistas of learning ahead of you as you progress toward spiritual maturity. And this progress is important. Counseled the apostle Paul: “Now that we have left the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 6:1</a>.</p>

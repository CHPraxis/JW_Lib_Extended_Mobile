<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In Atlanta, Georgia, a nine-year-old girl who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses told her classmates about her beliefs based on the Bible. She also informed them about her Christian view in regard to acts of nationalism. This is what happened:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One little girl told me that her mother told her that she was not to play with me anymore. I asked her why and she said that her mother did not want her to play with any of Jehovah’s witnesses. I then said to the girl, ‘Well, if I were you, I would obey her. That is what the Bible teaches us to do. So I suppose we will not be playing together now.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The next day she came back and said to me, ‘Rita, I told my mother that you told me to obey her and not play with you anymore and she said, “If that is how Rita believes, you play with her. Maybe some of that will rub off on you!”’”</p>

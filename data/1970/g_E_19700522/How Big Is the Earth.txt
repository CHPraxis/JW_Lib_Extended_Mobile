How Big Is the Earth
● The earth measures nearly 25,000 miles in circumference at the equator. It is said to weigh about 6,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 (6.6 sextillion) tons. Yet, it is dwarfed by other planets and stars. For instance, about one million earths could fit into the sun! And some suns, or stars, are so big that a trillion (a million times a million) earths could fit into them!

Paradise—a garden of delight. What an absorbing theme! This theme the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained follows from cover to cover. The book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” shows Scripturally what God’s will is and how those who love God can share in doing it on earth forever. Both books will be offered to the public during November on a contribution of $1.25, along with two informative Bible booklets.

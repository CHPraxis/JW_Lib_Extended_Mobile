FIELD MINISTRY
April is the final month of the twenty-first annual Watchtower campaign. A year’s subscription for this upbuilding, Scripturally authoritative journal will be offered for $1, and each new subscriber will receive three free booklets on timely Bible subjects. Contact Jehovah’s witnesses in your vicinity or write the Watch Tower Society for information on how you may share in this Christian service.
A SATISFYING COMBINATION
Here is a combination difficult to equal! First: the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures containing the Bible books Matthew to Revelation (800 pages, thin Bible paper, hard bound in green leatherette). Second: From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained the simplest and most satisfying explanation of man’s destiny ever released (256 pages, large clear type, beautifully illustrated). Both are yours for only $1.75. Send today and get a new lease on life.

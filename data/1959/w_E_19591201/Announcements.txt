FIELD MINISTRY
“It is the will of God,” say many when faced with heart-breaking events. How sadly they misconstrue God’s will! And when praying to God, “Your will be done on earth,” few realize that God’s will for earth means the restoration of paradise. To aid all persons of good will to get such important Bible knowledge, during December Jehovah’s witnesses will offer the two books “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, with two booklets, for $1.25.

“Witnesses Know the Bible Better”
By Watch Tower missionary in Ghana
Jesus chose his disciples from among the humble people, fishermen, shepherds and others of like stations in life. It is not surprising, then, to find the same type of persons responding and taking up the Christian ministry in this day. And just as when the Jews “beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering,” so, too, many today marvel at the ability of humble witnesses of Jehovah to expound God’s Word, the Bible.—Acts 4:13.
A minister of the Wesleyan Church recently asked one of Jehovah’s witnesses “How is it that you know your Bible so well?” He was told that Jehovah’s witnesses study the Bible privately and as a congregation. After conversing with the Wesleyan minister he made arrangements to speak to his congregation. In fact, every time this witness of Jehovah visits this town, the Wesleyan minister has the witness as his guest speaker. On one occasion he told his congregation: “It is very good that one of Jehovah’s witnesses has called on us this morning, as Jehovah’s witnesses know the Bible better than many of us here.”

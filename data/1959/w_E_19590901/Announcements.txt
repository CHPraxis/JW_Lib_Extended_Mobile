FIELD MINISTRY
September will witness the completion of the special three-month campaign during which the book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and a booklet are being offered from house to house for 50c. Appreciating the importance of the valuable and timely information contained in the book, all English-speaking congregations and individuals holding territory not yet worked with this offer will endeavor to cover it before the month ends.
ANNUAL MEETING
On Thursday, October 1, 1959, at ten o’clock in the forenoon, the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania will be held at the Society’s office located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Notice of the annual meeting will be sent to all the members. So that the letters of notice will reach the members shortly after September 1, all should be certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses.
Proxies will accompany the notice of meeting. Each member should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not and should do so so that the proxies will reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15.

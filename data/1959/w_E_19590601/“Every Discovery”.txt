“Every Discovery”
 In a lecture on “Joseph in Egypt in the Light of the Monuments,” Professor A. S. Yahuda of London said: “In conclusion, let me say this—Every discovery made in Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, has confirmed the Bible, and now at length the linguistic evidence is coming forth to support and complement archaeological evidence. I hope, nay, I am sure, that future archaeological discoveries, excavations, and researches will assist us still further in establishing the accuracy of the Book of books.—Journal of Transactions of the Victoria Institute, Vol. LXV, p. 54

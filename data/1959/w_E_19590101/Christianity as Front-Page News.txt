Christianity as Front-Page News
“It should never be forgotten that Christianity did not come into the world through the editorial page; it came through the news columns,” writes Halford E. Luccock, as quoted in Treasury of the Christian Faith. “It was a news event—front-page, stop-the-press news. Something happened. . . . The gospel was first preached as news. Whenever it has been preached with power, it has been preached as news. Whenever it has dwindled down to mere advice, become merely editorial Christianity, it has evaporated into a cloud as vague as fog.”
Christ Jesus showed that the message that God’s kingdom has been established in the heavens is news, the best kind of news, “good news” that must “be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.”—Matt. 24:14.

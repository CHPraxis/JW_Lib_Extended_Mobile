<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“HARDLY a meeting of a church body in the past 10 years has failed to adopt a resolution indorsing the U.N. as the principal hope for world peace and justice,” declared the Chicago <em>Daily Tribune. </em>And Roman Catholic Archbishop Robert E. Lucey of San Antonio, Texas, called the United Nations “our last hope for peace in the world.” Many sincere churchgoers, looking to the clergy for guidance, have joined in putting their confidence in the United Nations. How like the people in the first century!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, that fact came to be known by the religious leaders in Jerusalem. “Astrologers from eastern parts came to Jerusalem, saying: ‘Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when we were in the east and we have come to do him obeisance.’ At hearing this King Herod was agitated and all Jerusalem along with him, and on assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born. They said to him: ‘In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is how it has been written through the prophet.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 2:1-6</a>) They knew the prophecies. When Jesus grew to manhood they heard him preach about God’s kingdom. They saw with their own eyes as he did the things the prophets had foretold about him. But did they believe? No, they showed that they had placed their confidence, not in God and his kingdom by Christ, but in human alliances, for they rejected Jesus, cried out for his impalement, and said: “We have no king but Caesar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:15-43:19:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 19:15</a>) The people followed their lead. They chose the Roman government, the sixth world power, in preference to God’s kingdom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In our day, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy, the heavenly kingdom of God has come to birth, and its establishment has been proclaimed in all parts of the world. Yet the leaders of Christendom have turned their backs on Christ as the ruling Prince of Peace, persecuted his witnesses, and declared their confidence in the United Nations, saying: It is “our last hope for peace in the world.” The people follow their lead. They choose the United Nations in preference to God’s kingdom.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The confidence of those religious leaders who look to men to bring world peace is misplaced, and the confidence of persons who accept the guidance of clergymen who fail to teach God’s Word is betrayed. “It is better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in earthling man,” says the psalmist. Jehovah God, who cannot lie, has given his promise that his kingdom through Christ will bring abiding peace to God-fearing mankind. Confidence in his promise will not be disappointed.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:8-19:118:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 118:8</a>.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
“I am awake!” people will often say, and no doubt they are awake to many things. Yet how easy it is to overlook matters vital to one’s well being! To aid people to be awake to matters of greatest importance, during October Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for the magazine Awake! for $1. New subscribers will receive free three enlightening Bible booklets.
NOTICE TO READERS!
Have you seen Awake!, the companion magazine to this one you hold in your hand? Awake! does not deal primarily with Bible doctrine, but it is awake spiritually because it is governed by true Bible principles, not philosophy or expediency. It is a magazine of facts, news, everyday problems, practical sciences, human interests, natural wonders. It is instructive, wholesome reading for every member of the family. Over 2,800,000 copies are printed each issue in nineteen languages. Send only $1 for a year’s subscription and receive three booklets on timely Bible subjects free.

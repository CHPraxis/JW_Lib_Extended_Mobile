PRESERVE AND RENEW YOUR SPIRITUAL STRENGTH
Few men will expend their physical energy beyond the safety limit, yet few of these same men think seriously of renewing their spiritual strength. Day by day the exacting toll of daily problems saps them of their Christian vitality. Soon the corrupted values of this world infect their thinking and they become an easy prey to the many spiritual “diseases” afflicting the world. Do you have a proper safeguard? Millions are finding it in each issue of The Watchtower. Absorb regularly its healthful admonition in Bible study. Send $1 today for a year’s subscription.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“This do in remembrance of me,” said Jesus as he instituted the celebration commemorating his death. This year the date to observe the Lord’s evening meal, or the Memorial of his death, is March 23, after 6 p.m. All persons of good will are invited to be present with Jehovah’s witnesses when they assemble at their local meeting places in obedience to the command of the Lord Jesus to observe this most important occasion. Following a discourse on the Lord’s evening meal, the bread and the wine will be passed separately, after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each emblem. In conclusion all will be invited to share in special weekend field service to spread the Kingdom message. Congregations should make a diligent effort to help all good-will persons to be present at the Lord’s evening meal. If any of our readers do not know where the meetings in their vicinity are held, write to this office for information.</p>

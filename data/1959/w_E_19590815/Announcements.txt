ANNUAL MEETING
On Thursday, October 1, 1959, at ten o’clock in the forenoon, the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania will be held at the Society’s office located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Notice of the annual meeting will be sent to all the members. So that the letters of notice will reach the members shortly after September 1, all should be certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses,
Proxies will accompany the notice of meeting. Each member should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not and should do so so that the proxies will reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15.
MAKE SURE OF YOUR WAY OF LIFE
One of Jesus’ last promises on earth was made to a man not even one of his disciples—yet it holds out a hope for eternal blessings that will extend to all persons who are able to meet the requirements. Can you personally turn to the Bible and confidently point out those requirements for life? You can with the Bible-study helps From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained and “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” These two hard-bound books totaling 640 pages are yours for only $1.25. Send today and receive two booklets free.

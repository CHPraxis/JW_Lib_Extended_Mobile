The Necessity of a Designer
 Did all living things come into existence by chance? The fact is that none of them did. Said research chemist Edmund Kornfeld: “To one who has seen the complexity and yet the pervading order in organic chemistry—especially that in living systems—the idea of chance is repugnant in the extreme. The more one studies the science of molecular structure and interreaction, the more one is convinced of the necessity of a planner and designer of it all.”

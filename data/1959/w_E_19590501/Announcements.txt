For the first time the easy-to-understand and beautifully illustrated book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained will be distributed from house to house by Jehovah’s witnesses during May. The contribution for it will be 75c, and a free booklet will be given with it. Arrangements will be made to call back on those accepting the offer to start home Bible studies.

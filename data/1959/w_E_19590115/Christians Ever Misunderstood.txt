Christians Ever Misunderstood
 The complaints made against the Christian witnesses of Jehovah as to their not joining in with popular well-meant movements have a familiar ring to those who know the history of early Christianity. Thus second-century anti-Christian writer Celsus “besought them to help the Emperor [Marcus Aurelius] in his difficult task of saving the world. Let them come forth from their selfish isolation, let them assist his councils, and even join his armies as officers.” Yes, even as with dedicated Christians today, Christians back there in the second century were unpopular because “they refused to come into a scheme deemed vital to the interests of civilization.”—Eusebius of Caesarea, Foakes-Jackson.

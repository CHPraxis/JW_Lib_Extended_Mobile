Watchtower readers are invited to share in this activity. For further information, write us or go to the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses.
KEEP WATCHFUL WITH “THE WATCHTOWER”
Jesus said, ‘Be on the watch.’ For what? For his return and the coming of his kingdom to Armageddon. Are you keeping watchful? For nearly eighty years The Watchtower has served sincere watchers faithfully, and it is now “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom” as being here and due soon to take complete control of earth’s rule. Read every issue. Send $1 and receive a year’s subscription with three free booklets, God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near? World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom and “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

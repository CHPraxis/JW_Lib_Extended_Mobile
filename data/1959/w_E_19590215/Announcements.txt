FIELD MINISTRY
During February Jehovah’s witnesses will call on persons in all parts of the world, many of whom want to know the divine will concerning world happenings. To aid these persons of good will, they will offer them The Watchtower on a subscription basis, together with three Bible booklets, for $1. If you are not now associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses but would like to have a share in this activity, write to this office for further information.
WILL GOD’S WILL BE DONE?
Doubt and fear rule the world around us. Only true faith, based on God’s Word, can shield us from their penetrating influence and build up our hopes for the future. Such conviction is rewarding but it must have that sure foundation. Are you convinced when you pray that ‘God’s will be done on earth’? You can be. Obtain and read the handsome and inspiring bound book “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” Send only 50c.
1959 MEMORIAL
The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal this year is Monday, March 23, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. After the meeting has been opened with song and prayer, the discourse will be given by a qualified speaker, one of the remnant if available and capable. Then the emblems will be served separately after thanks have been offered to Jehovah for first the bread and then the red wine. All present will afterward be invited to share in special arrangements for field ministry, and then the meeting will close with song and prayer. Each congregation should start making arrangements for the Memorial.

FIELD MINISTRY
Paradise—a garden of delight. What an absorbing theme! This theme the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained follows from cover to cover. The book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” shows Scripturally what God’s will is and how those who love God can share in doing it on earth forever. Both books will be offered to the public during November on a contribution of $1.25, along with two informative Bible booklets.
PEACE IN OUR DAY?
The most hotly debated question of modern world diplomats, “Will peace come in our day?” was answered in the most reassuring terms this past summer at all Awake Ministers District Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the world. That answer and the hope it brings can be yours. Send at once for the booklet When God Speaks Peace to All Nations. It contains the most reliable of all evidences, proof from God’s own promises in his Word. Send today, 5c for one booklet or 10c for three, and be certain why and how peace will come in our day.

ASSEMBLY CHANGES
There will be no district assembly in Jackson, Miss., as was announced in the March 15 Watchtower. The assembly in Philadelphia, Pa., June 25-28, will be held at Connie Mack Stadium instead of Convention Hall. Additionally, there will be an assembly at Fairbanks, Alaska, at the Kingdom Hall (Carpenters Hall on Sunday), June 18-21. Keep these changes in mind in making your arrangements to attend an assembly this summer.
FIELD MINISTRY
For the first time the easy-to-understand and beautifully illustrated book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained will be distributed from house to house by Jehovah’s witnesses during May. The contribution for it will be 75c, and a free booklet will be given with it. Arrangements will be made to call back on those accepting the offer to start home Bible studies.
ARE YOU HELPED BY BIBLE READING?
Are you getting the most from your Bible reading? Are you getting the understanding? Take your Bible off the shelf and read it in the living language of today. The New World Translation of the Holy Bible is available in the Christian Greek Scriptures and four volumes of the Hebrew Scriptures (one more volume to be printed).

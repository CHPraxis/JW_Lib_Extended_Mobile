FIELD MINISTRY
September will witness the completion of the special three-month campaign during which the book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and a booklet are being offered from house to house for 50c. Appreciating the importance of the valuable and timely information contained in the book, all English-speaking congregations and individuals holding territory not yet worked with this offer will endeavor to cover it before the month ends.
“LOOK! I AM MAKING ALL THINGS NEW”
Men’s efforts to better world conditions continue to fail because men have nothing new to offer. Not so, however, with the Creator of the universe! He has observed human helplessness and has promised to restore obedient mankind to its rightful place. You can share in the fulfillment of that promise. Obtain and read the 32-page booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New.” It is only 5c, 3 for 10c.

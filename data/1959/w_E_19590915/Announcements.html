<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Men’s efforts to better world conditions continue to fail because men have nothing new to offer. Not so, however, with the Creator of the universe! He has observed human helplessness and has promised to restore obedient mankind to its rightful place. You can share in the fulfillment of that promise. Obtain and read the 32-page booklet <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New.” </em>It is only 5c, 3 for 10c.</p>

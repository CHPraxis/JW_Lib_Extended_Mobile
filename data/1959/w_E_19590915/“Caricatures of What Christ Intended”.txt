“Caricatures of What Christ Intended”
 Speaking of Christendom’s churches, British clergyman H. R. L. Sheppard, at one time canon of St. Paul’s Cathedral, wrote in If I Were Dictator: “Christianity is not in possession. . . . While religion attracts, the churches frequently repel by their strange and inhuman attention to secondary and irrelevant affairs. . . . It is impossible to suppose that the complicated forms which Christianity has so far assumed are any better than caricatures of what Christ intended.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Discussing Christendom’s worldly religions and their use of the Bible, cleric Harry Emerson Fosdick writes in <em>The Modern Use of the Bible: </em>“Our Western history has been one war after another. We have bred men for war, trained men for war; we have glorified war; we have made warriors our heroes and even in our churches we have put the battle flags. . . . With one corner of our mouth we have praised the Prince of Peace and with the other we have glorified war. So well have we succeeded in blending Christ and carnage, the Gospel and organized slaughter, that recently a missionary in an Oriental country, after an address upon Christian goodwill, was taken aside by a native, who said, ‘You must know that the educated people of this country look upon Christianity as a warring, blood-spilling religion.’”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible shows that false Christianity can be recognized by its fruitage: “They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:16-56:1:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 1:16</a>.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
The Bible-study aid “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and a booklet will be offered by Jehovah’s witnesses in their ministry during July, on a contribution of 50c. English congregations throughout the world will endeavor to cover all their territory with this offer during the next three months, so people everywhere will have the opportunity to obtain the book.
NOT MY WILL BUT YOUR WILL BE DONE
Jesus repeatedly prayed to his Father, ‘Not my will but your will be done.’ Is that your prayer also? Do you know what God’s will is? Do you know when it will be done and what part you can have in it? To help you answer these questions and many others like them, the publishers of The Watchtower have released a hard bound book of 384 pages on the thrilling theme “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” A copy will be sent to you postpaid on receipt of your contribution of 50c. Send for it without fail.

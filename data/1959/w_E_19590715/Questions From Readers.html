<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● At </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:1</strong></a> <strong>the <em>American Standard Version </em>and other translations say that the serpent was “more subtle” than any beast of the field. Why does the <em>New World Translation </em>say the serpent proved to be “the most cautious”?—S. R., U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation </em>is in harmony with the facts as well as in harmony with Jesus’ statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 10:16</a> in which he advises his disciples to be not only innocent as doves but also cautious as serpents. The Greek word that Jesus used was <em>phrónimos. </em>On this scripture the book published in German in Zurich, Switzerland, and entitled <em>“Kleine Lichter,” </em>meaning, “Little Lights,” by Ludwig Koehler, the Hebrew lexicographer, has the following to say on pages 78 and 79 under the subheading ‘Cautious Serpents’:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“On what peculiarity of serpents does Jesus think? What is the characteristic of serpents? To all serpents it is peculiar that they are cautious. Anyone, himself, can observe this when he encounters a serpent and every description of serpents verifies this. As soon as the serpent perceives the step of an approaching man he glides away. The serpent is cautious. In Greek this can quite well be expressed with the word ‘phronimos’ for in this cautiousness, watchfulness, the serpent reveals the possession and use of its <em>phrenes. </em>So, also, a person understands the instruction of Jesus. The disciples must work like sheep among wolves. In addition to that they use the artlessness of doves, but also the caution and watchfulness of serpents.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In harmony with Jesus’ instruction to his disciples, the description of the serpent or snake in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1</a> must be rendered. Certainly Dr. Koehler, who is the co-author of the Lexicon on the Books of the Old Testament in Hebrew and Aramaic, should know what he is talking about. In harmony with his suggestions, the New World Bible Translation renders the appropriate Hebrew words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1</a> as “cautious,” to agree with Jesus.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1</a> the Bible was not referring to Satan the Devil, who is indeed subtle and crafty. It was referring to the literal snake on the ground, which was merely the creature instrumentality used by the invisible Satan the Devil to deceive Eve. The serpent’s shyness and cautiousness led Eve to believe that the animal would be careful about making a mistake or running into trouble. So if the serpent said that the forbidden fruit was good to eat, without penalties attached, Eve felt that she could well believe the creature. The creature’s carefulness, cautiousness, shyness, helped to make an impression upon Eve and make her imagine that the Serpent was right.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In referring to the cautiousness of the serpent, which it had from its beginning there in the garden of Eden, the Lord Jesus Christ was instructing his disciples to exercise a proper trait in the carrying on of the Christian ministry. He was not instructing them to act in a subtle manner like Satan the Devil to cover up their tracks and intentions and stratagems for the purpose of working injury irreparably to an innocent victim. The serpent became a symbol of Satan the Devil only when God cursed it because of the use that the adversary had made of this shy, cautious animal to bring about the fall of mankind into disobedience and sin toward man’s Creator, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>● Is it proper for a brother to conduct the funeral service of an individual who was never associated with Jehovah’s witnesses and who committed suicide?—K. L., U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This all depends on the conscientious attitude of the brother in the truth who may be requested to perform the funeral service. If his conscience revolts against the thought because of self-murder, then he should not violate his conscience by performing the ceremony. If another <span id="page448" class="pageNum" data-no="448" data-before-text="448"></span>capable brother feels that he can conscientiously do so, there is no objection to his doing so. Whereas he cannot preach the suicide into heaven or even hold forth Scriptural promises that the suicide will have an opportunity for life in the new world, and although he does not condone the suicide, yet he appreciates that the holding of a funeral service affords a marvelous opportunity to give a witness to God’s kingdom and the blessings that it will bring to mankind, including the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Having never been associated with the truth, the suicide was ignorant and became guilty of a crime that many other persons have become guilty of in ignorance, even to the committing of murder of another person. His standing depends upon whether he is susceptible to the ransom sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah decides from reading the suicide’s heart whether he is still susceptible to the provision of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ and whether he will be called out of the memorial tomb by the reigning King, Jesus Christ. He may have an opportunity for life in the new world. So nothing definite may be stated at the funeral in the way of a promise concerning the future life of the suicide. Just the same, an effective witness can be given to all those who gather together for the funeral service, the people who knew the suicide. The principles of Christian truth can be stated, and whatever comfort the bereaved ones may take from the statement of Christian principles as affecting even the suicide they may do so after hearing the funeral sermon.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">With a view to helping sincerely repentant ones to get back into proper relationship with Jehovah God and his organization, it has been the policy of the Society to permit disfellowshiped persons to be present at all meetings at the Kingdom Hall that are open to the general public. For married persons Jesus set out the proper viewpoint when he said: “Did you not read that he who created them at the beginning made them male and female and said: ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 19:4-6</a>) This rule would seem to apply at the Kingdom Hall as well as elsewhere. In view of this it would seem to be improper to force a separation between a man and his wife even if one or the other is disfellowshiped. This is not having fellowship spiritually on the part of the faithful one with the disfellowshiped partner. However, it would be wrong for the individual who is in good standing to try to force the company of the disfellowshiped mate upon the other brothers and sisters in the congregation in the endeavor to have them recognize the disfellowshiped one and have communion with that one.</p>

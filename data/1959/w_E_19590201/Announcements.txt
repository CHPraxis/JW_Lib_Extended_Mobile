FIELD MINISTRY
During February Jehovah’s witnesses will call on persons in all parts of the world, many of whom want to know the divine will concerning world happenings. To aid these persons of good will, they will offer them The Watchtower on a subscription basis, together with three Bible booklets, for $1. If you are not now associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses but would like to have a share in this activity, write to this office for further information.
WHEN YOUTH WILL FADE NO MORE
“Utopia” and the “fountain of youth” are two dreams of unending happiness sought by men throughout the world. Such false hopes and disappointment have they brought that most men now believe them nonexistent. But are they? Yes, in the form that men have sought them. But the fondest dreams of men cannot compare with the paradise Almighty God has promised to restore to earth. This hope is real and certain for our generation! Would you like the proof? Then send 75c at once for the beautifully illustrated hard-bound book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. It is based on God’s unfailing Word, the Holy Bible.

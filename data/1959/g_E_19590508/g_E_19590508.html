<p><span class="font13">iiTVyHAT a foolish question!” do you </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font13">exclaim? Not at all. For it is not enough that we eat sufficient food, we must also eat the right kind or we may be putting on weight and yet be suffering from malnutrition. Thus note what </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter,</span><span class="font13"> December 13, 1958, had to say under the heading “Americans Starve as They Eat and Grow Fat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Millions of Americans are growing fat and starving themselves at the same time. . . . Many persons simply starve their bodies of food they need,” such as protein, “while growing fat on food they do not need,” such as excessive amounts of fat, sugar and starch. So it is indeed possible to put on weight and yet starve. Could the same be true in a religious, spiritual or figurative sense? Indeed it can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Today organized religion is putting on weight in many lands, both organizationally and individually. It is seen in the increase of church memberships and in the construction of new church buildings. And it can be seen in the increased use of religious medals and statuettes and by the popularity of “inspirational” literature and religious entertainment. All this looks very fine, but is it religious muscle or fat?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The steady increase in crime, in divorces, in illegitimacy, in sex offenses, and, in particular, the calloused indifference to corruption in high places, in government, in industry and in organized labor, all testify to the fact that spiritual fat is replacing spiritual muscle. Why this inconsistent condition? Because the people are not being fed wholesome, solid religious food but sentimental sweets. Long ago the apostle Paul foretold this very condition, telling that the time would come when men “will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled.” As a result another of his prophecies is having its fulfillment, namely that men will be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion,” an appearance of spiritual health, &quot;but proving false to its power,” actually suffering from spiritual malnutrition.—2 Tim. 4:3, 4; 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Rather than their being well fed, Amos 8:11 says of their condition that there is a “famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.”—AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do you avoid making such mistakes? Do you want to be spiritually well-fed, healthy and strong? Then feed on the nourishing food of God's Word.</span></p>

Jf Only one way . to God, why ore there so many kinds </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of religion?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">speaking, their replies would go something like this: ‘We have many different kinds of religion because people are different. They have different tastes, different likes and dislikes. So we hear men say, One man’s religion is another man’s poison.’ Others declare religion to be a state of mind. ‘Many minds, many religions,’ they say. Some blame the hodgepodge of religions on religious ambiguity in doctrine, requirements and ideals. One observer took the program “This I Believe’” as an example. He said the radio program had “plenty of ‘believe’ and quite a bit of ‘I,’ but not very much of ‘this.’ There was a great deal of ‘faith’ professed but the ‘believers’ were often sublimely vague about just what it was they believed in.” And so go the reasons for there being so many religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is actually difficult today in Christendom to get two professing Christians to agree on a single cause or give a Bible answer for the many religions. Yet the apostle Paul said to Christians: “I exhort you, brothers, . . . that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among you, but that you may</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14">be fitly united in the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font14"> same mind and in the same line of thought.” This oneness of mind and thought is admittedly sadly missing. —1 Cor. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In fact, the very word &quot;religion” gives rise to considerable confusion. There is still no one generally accepted definition for the word. Webster’s New </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Collegiate Dictionary</span><span class="font14"> defines religion to mean “the service and adora-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">tion of God or a god as expressed in forms of worship.” On the other hand, some sociologists refer to religion as the “collective expression of human values.” For centuries the Bible itself has revealed to man an authentic account of religion. It shows Adam and Eve did it. The preflood world did it. The children of Israel did it. The people of Jesus’ day did it. And now we see the whole world doing it. Doing what? Doing the very thing the ancients did that was responsible for the rise of so many religions. Where religion was involved, the vast majority of earth’s inhabitants have always leaned to their own understanding. Few and far between were those who consulted God’s Word on the matter. Invariably men preferred their own ideas and opinions to the wise counsel of God. In so doing they plunged themselves into destruction and ruin. Wise King Solomon wrote: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">paths straight. Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.” Only a very limited number of mankind heeded this excellent ad</span><span class="font13">vice.—Prov. 3:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From One Religion to Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In Eden there was only one religion. Adam and Eve worshiped Jehovah by obeying his commandments. One of these commands is recorded at Genesis 2:16, 17, which says: “Jehovah God also laid this command upon the man: ‘From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Freedom from death! A chance to be “like God, knowing good and bad”! With such lying claims a new religion was introduced to Eve in Eden. The new religion promised freedom and life without any restrictions. Jehovah told Adam, if you disobey me “you will positively die.” However, the author of the new religion told Eve, if you disobey God “you positively will not die.” The new religion appealed to Eve. She leaned to her own understanding and disobeyed God’s command. Adam followed her in transgression. By so doing Adam and Eve practiced false religion. That which they listened to and served was a lie and it brought them nothing but misery, sorrow and death.—Gen. 3:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Who was responsible for the new religion? Not Jehovah, “for God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace.” This false religion brought disorder, confusion, where there was peace. Jesus identified the Devil, “the father of the lie,” as the author of the new religion. The Devil sows his seed of falsehood in an effort to turn all men away from the true God Jehovah.-1 Cor. 14:33; John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since Eden’s day these many falsehoods have given rise to false religions. Archae</span><span class="font13">ological discoveries of recent date show that men before the Flood had a number of religions and that these were based on belief in soul survival after bodily death. Belief in life after death appears to have been popular. There was widespread idolatry and sex worship. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Targum, of Palestine</span><span class="font13"> states as to Enosh’s day: “That was the generation in whose days they began to err, and to make themselves idols, </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font13">surnamed their idols by the name of the word of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The early forms of false religions </span><span class="font14">drove </span><span class="font13">mankind to gross immorality and violence. The Genesis account says: “The </span><span class="font14">badness </span><span class="font13">of man had become great in the </span><span class="font14">earth </span><span class="font13">and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the </span><span class="font14">time.” </span><span class="font13">“The earth became filled with violence. </span><span class="font14">So </span><span class="font13">God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on </span><span class="font14">the </span><span class="font13">earth.” A ruined mankind was the </span><span class="font14">price </span><span class="font13">of false worship, the penalty for leaning upon his own understanding in matters of religion.—Gen. 6:5,11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">True religion, however, managed to survive the corruption and degradation. </span><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font13">Bible testifies: “Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the God.” By following God’s direction and by not leaning upon his own understanding, Noah was moved to build an ark that proved to be his place of refuge during the flood. His worship, the worship </span><span class="font14">of Jeho</span><span class="font13">vah, was the only religion that survived. All others were destroyed, which proves that there is only one way to salvation— Jehovah’s way.—Gen. 6:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion After the Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For a time after </span><span class="font14">the </span><span class="font13">flood the </span><span class="font14">worship </span><span class="font13">of Jehovah was the only religion </span><span class="font14">in the </span><span class="font13">earth. However, once again, the Devil set</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">about to re-create false religion. With Nimrod he started state worship. Then he moved men to build towering temples in defiance of Jehovah. The basic false religious doctrine of human immortality and its correlative doctrine, the transmigration of the soul, were introduced to mankind. Symbols were used in worship. From the worship of symbols to the worship of images was a short step. Sex worship was also reinstituted.—Gen. 10:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In many lands the sun became the chief object of worship. Superstitious men would say, What if the sun-spirit should become angry and not shine? How would man hunt, fish and live? So everything must be done to keep the sun-spirit happy. How? Early each morning before sunrise the holiest of men were chosen to climb to the top of a high mountain or hill, so as to be close to the sun, then sing to the sun-spirit and praise him for his kindnesses to men. So sun worship got its start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Soon thereafter moon and stars were worshiped. Then came the forces of nature, thunder, wind and rain. Nature itself was worshiped. Then men watched tadpoles change into frogs and caterpillars into beautiful butterflies. They reasoned, surely this was proof that life went on after death, that at death man merely sheds one body for another. It was easy for men to believe that mighty men became mighty animals in the next life. So they made images of these animals and worshiped them as they did these men whom they worshiped prior to their death. Soon there were carved images of animals, birds, trees and creeping things. So nature worship passed into idol worship. The Christian apostle Paul said of such worship: Although men “knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened. Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things.” This inspired account shows conclusively that false religions stem from false reasonings* from men leaning upon their own understanding and not upon God.—Rom. 1:21-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let this fact not escape our notice: from Eden’s day forward, true religion has always existed apart from all false religions. Time and again true worshipers were warned not to compromise with false religion. To Israel Moses said: “Jehovah your God you should fear and him you should serve and by his name you should swear. You must not walk after other gods, any gods of the peoples who are all around you, (for Jehovah your God in your midst is a God exacting exclusive devotion,) for fear the anger of Jehovah your God may blaze against you and he must annihilate you from off the surface of the ground.” The Israelites, however, did not always heed this warning. First, they fell victim to idolatry. Later, they succumbed to false religious traditions, which Jesus said made invalid God’s Word.—Deut. 6:13-15; Matt. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Christianity and Apostasy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus Christ re-established true religion. He proved that true religion leads to everlasting life, whereas false religion leads to sorrow and death. Of himself he said: &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” But what is that way today? you ask. There are literally hundreds of different kinds of so-called Christian religions in the United States alone, all of them teaching contradictory doctrines, and yet all of them claim to be the true religion. How can this be? Why so many “Christian”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">religions? How can we recognize and choose the right one?—John 14:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After the apostles and their close colaborers died, the true Christian organization was lost sight of and a great majority of professing Christians gradually fell away to the subtleties of false religion. The very apostasy that Paul foretold rapidly came to the fore. Paul said: “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.” That is precisely what happened. Men arose who spoke twisted things that split the Christian congregations. By 325 (A.D.) the apparent strength of the organized “Christian” apostasy was sought to bolster up the dying structure of the pagan state religion of-Rome. In that year (A.D. 325) Emperor Constantine called the first ecumenical council at Nicaea (Nice) in Asia Minor. After weeks of stormy sessions a statement of doctrine was adopted that incorporated the pagan doctrine of the &quot;trinity.” In the course of a few years other pagan teachings, such as mother-and-child worship, Christmas, Easter, use of the cross, the sacrifice of the mass, prayers for the dead, and purgatory were all made a part of the new religion.—Acts 20:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During the ensuing years priestcraft became unbearable. Protests were heard. The Greek part of the original Catholic realm refused to recognize the pope of Rome as the universal sovereign of the church. A split took place. The Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox religious organizations came into power. The Russo-Greek Church branched from the patriarchate of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Over in France, a merchant of Lyons named Petrus Waldus began to protest against the growing apostasy of the Ro</span><span class="font14">man Catholic Hierarchy. His followers were called the Waldenses. A teacher at Oxford </span><span class="font13">University who was also a Roman Catholic priest called John Wycliffe spoke out against the Roman Catholic clergy. His followers were called Lollards. Then came such men as Martin Luther in Germany, John Calvin in France, Ulrich Zwingle in Switzerland, John Knox in Scotland, Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley and Hugh Latimer and others who shook the very foundations of the Catholic Church. What these men taught began what is known today as Protestantism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Luther, for example, vigorously protested against the Catholic Church. He drew a great many people after himself. His teachings were called Lutheranism. John Calvin distinguished himself as an important religious writer on Christianity. His teachings became known as Calvinism. John Knox preached in Scotland. His teachings were called Presbyterianism. The Anabaptists appeared on the scene about Peter Waldo’s time. They were the forerunners of a number of Protestant sects, among them the Baptists, the Congregationalists and the Quakers of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">About this time, too, the Bible began to be circulated in the language of the people. There was much private interpretation and twisting of Scripture, which resulted in a whole new crop of religions. There were the Abecedarians, a sect led by Nicholas Stork, who “opposed the simplest forms of education, even the learning of the A B C’s, on the ground that it prevented divine illumination and hindered spiritual sanctification.” Then there were the Abelites, an African sect that opposed procreation on the ground that it was a perpetuation of sin. Even a Satanist sect arose. The worshipers of this religion prayed to Satan, because they believed he had power to do good and evil. Some religions would accept certain parts of the Bible; other</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">religions would reject them. A good many have rejected the Bible altogether. So that today there are literally thousands of different kinds of religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Who is responsible for this religious confusion? In Jesus’ illustration of the sower he exposes the guilty culprit in these words: &quot;The sower of the right kind of seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; as for the right kind of seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one, and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a consummation of a system of things, and the reapers are angels.” So the Devil is the one responsible for all the false religion in the world. But Jesus stated that true religion would also be on earth at this time. Do we see it? How can it be recognized? How can we be sure?—Matt. 13:37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where True Religion Is Found</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">True religion can be recognized today in the same way that it could in the past. True religion was always associated with the worship of Jehovah. In Eden the first, man worshiped Jehovah. Righteous Abel worshiped Jehovah. Enoch and Noah worshiped Jehovah. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses and Jesus and all righteous men worshiped Jehovah as God. And worshipers who practice the true religion today do the same. They, too, worship Jehovah as God. Men of old kept God’s Word, They were his witnesses: “ ‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I am God.’ ” So in this day worshipers of Jehovah are his witnesses—Jehovah’s witnesses.—Isa. 43:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Certainly Christendom’s religions bear no similarity to first ^century Christianity. Her clergy teach for hire, mix in politics and support wars for material gain. They teach pagan doctrines, compromise theocratic principles, reject the Bible and advocate schemes of men such as the United Nations in preference to the kingdom of God. Her religions are powerless in the path of communism. They do not worship Jehovah as their God. In fact, they are ashamed of that name. They disown Jehovah and have removed God’s name from their modem Bibles. Therefore, they have no hope, nothing to offer to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the other hand, the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses know what they believe and why. They have accepted the Bible as their guide and follow it closely. They are uncompromising in Bible principles. They do not meddle in politics and wars of this world. They have stripped their teachings of all pagan doctrines. They preach the truths of God’s Word and hail the kingdom of God as the only hope for mankind and not some man-made makeshift world-organization as the League of Nations or the United Nations. It is Jehovah’s, established kingdom that Jehovah’s witnesses declare in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations before the end of this system of things. Jesus said Christians would be declaring his kingdom at this time.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With these truths before you, there is a choice for you to make. In the words of Joshua, you must ‘‘choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.” In making your choice, however, do not err as many men in the past have done and as many are doing today by leaning to their own understanding. Let Jehovah’s holy spirit and his written Word the Bible guide you. They will motivate you into making a wise choice of religion, the decision that Joshua made: &quot;But as for me and my household,” he said, “we shall serve Jehovah.” Serve Jehovah. Associate with his witnesses. Remember, only servers of Jehovah will survive this world’s end to enjoy peace and life forevermore in God’s new world of righteousness. Choose wisely and live. —Josh. 24:15; Prov. 3:5,6,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">through the schools of many cities is a current of unrest and delinquency. No mere wave of pranks is this. Rowdyism, extortion rackets and violence are taking place in the schools—on playgrounds, in corridors, even in classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One New York city teacher recently wrote a prominent judge: “Vandalism, theft, immoral activities, fights and bodily and mental harm done to teachers are not uncommon. We are now teaching behind locked doors, and demoralization of pupil regard for teachers is especially evident. The common joke among the population is that ‘the teachers are scared.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Stationed at New York city’s most delinquency-ridden schools now are policemen. One of the so-called “difficult” schools with a policeman is Brooklyn’s John Marshall Junior High School. Here, in the month of January, 1958, a thirteen-year-old girl was raped, a patrolman was punched by one of six youths ordered not to loiter in the building, and a recreation director was assaulted by two youths in the basement. The situation has become</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">wrcrsr</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">so difficult in some schools that the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram and Sun </span><span class="font13">was prompted to send out a reporter, one George N. Allen, in disguise as a teacher. Reporter Allen, a Columbia University graduate, got a teaching job at the John Marshall Junior High School. After two months he quit teaching and wrote a series of fifteen articles about the delinquency problem for his newspaper. This is what reporter Allen found:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“There is open defiance in the classrooms. Teachers have been threatened </span><span class="font14">with </span><span class="font13">violence by </span><span class="font14">students. . . . Decent </span><span class="font13">children are terrorized by hoodlums </span><span class="font14">in </span><span class="font13">classrooms and corridors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When he started teaching, reporter </span><span class="font14">Al</span><span class="font13">len felt almost as if he were beginning a course in lion taming: “One </span><span class="font14">of the first </span><span class="font13">bits of advice I received was this chiller from an assistant principal: ‘You </span><span class="font14">must </span><span class="font13">never let them see that you are afraid,’ he told me. . . . ‘Even if you </span><span class="font14">are afraid, </span><span class="font13">you have to walk into your classroom </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font13">make them think that youare not afraid.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Maintaining discipline in the classroom was a formidable problem, Allen </span><span class="font14">found. </span><span class="font13">“I was conducting a quiet and orderly lesson,” he wrote in one </span><span class="font14">of his articles, </span><span class="font13">“when two rowdies in the back of </span><span class="font14">the </span><span class="font13">room suddenly stood up, squared off </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font13">started slugging each other. ‘Stop!’ I shouted. ‘Stop that fighting.’ They kept right on punching. Finally I had to rush to the rear of the room and step between </span><span class="font14">them. </span><span class="font13">. . . The rest of the class was roaring. They howled and shouted and cheered each battier. They banged their desks with </span><span class="font14">their </span><span class="font13">books as I shoved the boys to </span><span class="font14">the front </span><span class="font13">of the room. I lectured them, then </span><span class="font14">told </span><span class="font13">them to return to their seats. But as soon</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">as I released them they began lambasting each other again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Allen’s articles caused an uproar among school officials, but the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font14"> stood firm for what it had published, one editor declaring: “We studied every article carefully and toned down all of them. Conditions are much worse than what we said.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Problem of Big Cities—but Spreading</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">New York is not the only city troubled with delinquency in the schools. Many of the big cities, especially in the northern part of the United States, are having trouble. In Philadelphia police patrol the corridors of ten difficult schools. Their main job is to keep teen-age hoodlums from entering the school to terrorize it. Philadelphia is now reported to have a shortage of seven hundred teachers. If teachers cannot get assignments to good schools, they often quit. Describing a common type of delinquency, Philadelphia’s district attorney recently said: “We do have a lot of youngsters who exact tribute from the younger children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In Detroit teachers report that much of the delinquency in the schools is not made known to the public. If it were it would reflect on the ability of the teachers to control the students. But it is known that teachers have been threatened and ■ struck. Trouble often comes, however, from nonstudents—teen-age hoodlums either unable or unwilling to get a job. They loiter around school buildings and cause trouble. Telling about a male teacher at one of Detroit’s high schools, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">U. S. News World Report</span><span class="font14"> said: “He repeatedly asked his principal for police protection from prowling gangs when he was stationed in the schoolyard to keep order after school. The principal refused to get police help— because of concern over publicity—until the teacher brought a pistol to school and warned that he would use it if attacked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Kansas City </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font14"> not long ago told its readers: “The breakdown of discipline in an increasing number of Kansas City’s high schools is spreading at an alarming rate. ... In some classrooms, a hoodlum element has taken control.... Many teachers, by their own admissions, are losing control.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In Chicago, Superintendent of Schools Benjamin C. Willis reports some improvement: “We have less violence in the schools rather than more, than we had a few years ago.” However, a high police official in Chicago told </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">U.</span><span class="font14"> S. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">News &lt;&amp;&nbsp;World Report;</span><span class="font14"> “Very few educators will ever admit there is anything wrong with their schools. They’re afraid they might be fired. . . . Teachers don’t know how to handle the situation, or what to do.” A big problem is nonstudent gangs that loiter around schools. That some classrooms lack discipline is evident from what one teacher told a police official: “I just try to keep order in the classrooms. If the kids behave, I pass them. That’s all I want out of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Though the problem of delinquency in the schools is mainly a problem of certain sections of large cities, the unrest has already spread to small cities. Last May Dr. W. C. Kvaraceus, professor of education at Boston University and a recognized authority on juvenile delinquency, was asked: How widespread is this bad behavior on the part of school children? He answered: “I don’t think that this is unique in the States. I think this is universal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Wherever it occurs, delinquency in the schools distracts children from their studies. Teachers become less effective, as their time and energy are wasted trying to maintain discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How is it that delinquency in the schools has become so sensational now? This is not a problem that has suddenly developed, says Jackson Toby, assistant professor of sociology at Rutgers University. “The</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'crime wave’ in the schools is no more than a public focusing of attention on 'a chronic problem,” he says. “Recent news stories about rapes, assaults and thefts in public schools are (for the most part) factually correct, but they could have been duplicated in any previous year. A school crime wave occurred in 1958 because newspaper editors . . . decided that school offenses were worthy of more detailed coverage than the hundreds of other crimes committed every day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But there is something that is rather recent. Getting right to the crux of the matter, a veteran school official who grew up in New York city says: “Crime is not exactly a new thing in New York schools. It’s been going on as long as I can remember. But there is a change in the pattern of youthful misbehavior. The youngsters today seem to be more aggressive, more violent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Why this increased violence in the schools? Why do children become student delinquents? There are many facets to the problem. Some observers feel that teachers and administrators are to blame. Educators, however, have good arguments to show that poor co-operation from parents is a big factor in this terrible situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">School Discipline and World Conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Is the discipline in schools lax? Many authorities contend that stricter discipline is needed. Making.a sharp comment on this matter, Philadelphia's Police Commissioner Thomas J. Gibbons recently said: “We have to have respect for constituted authority, and that’s not only as it applies to the police but in the schools. . . . We’ve gotten away from the custom of giving them a cuff on the ear, as we used to get in school when we got out of order. We learned that you couldn’t do these things in the classroom. But we seem to have gotten away from that. I know for a fact that if any of the youngsters in school today are cuffed around by a teacher, immediately there’s a demand to have the teacher removed, and so you can’t have discipline.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">District Attorney Victor H. Blanc of Philadelphia also feels there is a need for going back to spanking delinquent students. He says: “I know when I was a youngster in school, if I did something wrong, I would get cracked over the knuckles with a great big ruler that the teacher had, or I can remember being sent down to the principal’s office at the public school when I had done something I shouldn’t have done and got a terrific ‘lacing’ from the principal. Nobody thought of taking the principal to the federal court and charging him with a violation of civil rights. But that’s what happens today. . . . The whole lack of discipline in the schools today is something which is very, very frightening. And the police themselves, when they are attacked by kids of this kind, are afraid to let them have it as they should, because they are taken down and charged with violation of civil rights and tried in the federal courts as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus the laws in many localities prevent school officials from applying the discipline that is needed. But even if schools are given the right to spank children, this is recognized as being only a partial solution. “The schools,” says Dr, Kvaraceus, “by themselves, can do little or nothing.” The undisciplined culture in which children live and the violence in the world are formidable factors, says this authority. “I think it’s a reflection of the violence and self-indulgence in our culture. . . . Let me say that all you have to do is pick up any headline in terms of, let’s say, a mock air raid—which is suggestive of violence . . . and the need for a ‘summit’ conference under the threat of war—the implication being that the one way to solve your prob-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">lems is to fight your way through to a solution.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Coping with the Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To cope with the problem some schools are suspending delinquent students. This solution, however, only raises another problem: What is to become of youngsters who are branded as ineducable and who are unable to find work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">New York city has approached the delinquency situation by establishing special schools for problem pupils. About 1 percent of New York city's 950,000 school population is described as the hard core of the problem. To cope with this the city has organized the so-called ”600” day schools for the most difficult problem boys from nine to seventeen years of age. These schools, so named because each of them has a number in the 600’s, were first set up in 1947. But with the recent outbreaks of violence in the schools, the city established four emergency schools called ”700” scnools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because of the outbreaks of violence in New York city schools, the State Education Department sent two task forces to find out ways to improve the city’s handling of delinquents. The state’s findings were that the “600” schools “in many important respects are succeeding very well.” However, the state’s report, said the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font14"> “termed the city’s efforts wanting in many important respects. The state said there appeared sometimes to be an almost unreasonable dependence upon the schools to effect cures although they cannot deal with the causes of delinquency: slums, poverty and shattered families.” New York city’s Board of Education issued its own findings: “In its basic elements it is a reflection not of the schools but rather of the society in which it exists.” There is a need, said the board, for “full recognition by the whole community that there is no substitute for the principles of religion and morality.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Crux of the Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What, then, can be done about the student delinquents? The children need to be taught the principles of morality from their infancy. They need to be trained and disciplined from their infancy; and that must be done in the home. “I think the main trouble,” said an experienced New York school official, “is a breaking down of discipline in the home.” J. Edgar Hoover, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, recently pointed his finger right at the heart of the problem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Any program to combat juvenile delinquency can begin in only one place—the home. Abdication of parental responsibility . . . has gained a strangle hold on all too many American households today. One jurist said recently: ‘The (delinquency) problem is not so much an improper youth as it is an improper home.’ Unquestionably, the very heart of the delinquency problem rests with the family.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">This Week</span><span class="font14"> magazine, November 2, 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So delinquency in the schools is just another facet of the whole juvenile delinquency problem. If children are not properly disciplined in the home from infancy, how can they be expected to behave in school? If home discipline is weak, then even intensified school discipline will hardly solve the problem. Only parental training and discipline can solve the twin problem of student delinquents and nonstudent hoodlums. Note carefully what man’s Creator has to say about solving the problem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” “Do not hold back discipline from the mere boy. In case you beat him with the rod, he will not die. With the rod you yourself should beat him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">that you may deliver his very soul from Sheol itself.” “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.”—Prov. 22:6; 23:13, 14; 13:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Obedient and well-trained children may come into contact with the delinquent element in the schools. To guard against contamination, Christian parents also train their children as to the importance of right association, in harmony with the Bible rule; “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”—! Cor. 15:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The main responsibility for right training and discipline rests with the parents, not the schools. Unless this is recognized there will be little progress made in wiping out delinquency in the schools.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">THE psalmist said that wine makes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font13">heart of man glad. Those who live in Portugal feel that they have just the wine for that purpose. It is known throughout the world for its superb taste and aroma. It is the famous port wine or, as some like to call it, “bottled sunshine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although this world-renowned wine has the name of Portugal’s second-largest city, the grapes needed to make this delicious nectar do not. come from Oporto (in Portuguese, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Porto).</span><span class="font13"> They are specially selected and must come from a certain region in Portugal known as the Douro River valley. There was a time when the boundaries of this area were very vague and uncertain. But in the second half of the eighteenth century the government stepped in and definitely determined what would be called the Douro region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the Douro River cuts its way through the rugged mountainous terrain of Portugal, if leaves behind beautiful landscaped mountain slopes terraced to make vineyards. Some of the terrace walls are as high as twenty to thirty feet above ground and represent many days and months of tedious work done by the peasants. The soil in this region is composed mostly of schistose rock, which seems to give the plants the essential nutritive elements that the grapes need to be used for port wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then, too, the climate is another factor that cannot be overlooked. The winters arc very cold. It is not surprising to see the thermometer touch the freezing mark. However, this cold weather is a blessing in disguise because it kills many of the parasites that attack the vines. Then in the summer we have the other extreme, foi’ the temperature reaches as high as 107 degrees in the shade. It is perhaps due to the intense heat and sunshine that the grapes receive that some refer to port wine as “bottled sunshine.” Without this heat and sunshine the grapes would never reach the high sugar content needed for the wine. By the way, not all grapes grown in the Douro River valley are suitable for</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">port wine. They must come from a certain height above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is interesting to note that these vines are not watered by man-made irrigation, but depend solely on the rainfall, October to March being the rainy season. During this season the workers make small ditches around each plant so as to form a small reservoir of water to trickle down to the roots, because in all probability during the long hot summer months there will be no rainfall. Also during the cold bitter rainy months of winter the peasants can be seen pruning the vines. But what makes this scene even more picturesque is the strange attire tfiey wear as protection against the rain. They wear huge cloaks or capes made of various layers of straw and a straw hat. From a distance they appear as bundles of straw among the bare grapevines.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Wine-making Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let us now get to the wine-making time. This is when there is plenty of hard work to be done. The peasants by the hundreds, men, women and children, migrate to the vintage sections of the country. These workers are easily spotted as one goes along the road or passes the railroad station, They all have certain things in common. The men usually have a stick or staff over their shoulder, at the end of which is tied a burlap sack with their belongings. The women carry their things in a basket well balanced on their heads. The men also carry a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">troixa.</span><span class="font14"> It is cylindrical in shape, made of leather or strong cloth stuffed with straw. It has a wide strap that goes around it, the upper part going over the top of the head, causing the leather part to fall between the shoulder blades. It is used to rest the large baskets of grapes on the back of their necks and heads; these they must carry from the mountain slopes to the large cement vats called </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">lagares, </span><span class="font14">where the grapes will be transformed into liquid. The women and children are used to pick the grapes and fill the basnets, which weigh from 100 to 150 pounds. They work from sunrise to sunset. The men, to lighten their laborious task of carrying these heavy baskets, often walk in a line marking time to a whistle,, which the first man in line will blow. Sometimes he will play a mouth organ or a small accordion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The part of the work that the men seem to enjoy the most is the treading of the grapes in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">lagares.</span><span class="font14"> This is still done with the human foot. They claim that this ancient method insures more depth of color and richness without any bitter flavor from the skins, pips and stalks. In this vat that will make about 100 to 110 &quot;pipes” (or casks, holding about 550 liters each) of wine there will be over twenty-five men treading the grapes, wading in must well over their knees. To get the grapes fermenting will take about four hours of treading, which is usually done at night from nine o’clock to one in the morning; this after the men have been working since sunrise. Some of the men tread independently, or they will line up side by side joining arms at the shoulders and one will mark time as they slowly move around the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">lagar.</span><span class="font14"> Also, while treading, many times one will play his mouth organ, another will play the accordion, others sing, and still others dance around to the music. All in all, there is much laughter and frolic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the men get through treading the grapes, fermentation is allowed to reach a certain point. At this time they check it by adding </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">aguardente</span><span class="font14"> (brandy made from wine). They usually add about a hundred liters of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">aguardente</span><span class="font14"> to a cask. This new wine is then allowed to mature in chestnut or oak casks through the winter months there at the vineyards. The cold winter helps to clear the impurities in the wine, which fall to the bottom of the cask. After a few months the wine is drawn off</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">and put into another &quot;pipe” ready for shipping to the wineries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Most of these wineries are located in Villa Nova de Gaya, a town on the Douro River across from Oporto. There was a time when all the wine was shipped there by boats called </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">rabclos,</span><span class="font13"> which are peculiar to the Douro River. They are*flat-bottomed, having a long wooden rudder of a peculiar shape, which is fixed in the stern and acts like a powerful lever. But more and more the wineries are using the railroad 'and truck companies, for they can operate at any time of the year, whereas the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">rabelos </span><span class="font13">could be used only in winter when the river was high. Once the port wine reaches</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Villa Nova de Gaya it is stored and aged in the wineries for many years. They claim that the wines should not be much more than thirty years old. From this town they export the port, mostly in casks, not bottled, to all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Made to Suit Your Taste</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One will find that there are many kinds of port wine. The color will vary from deep ruby to white. The coloring of the wine comes from the action of the alcohol on the pigment in the skin of the grape. Therefore the more they tread the grapes the darker the wine. For the white port they use a special white grape. Also, they blend various ports to obtain the color desired. Although both the red and white port come from the same region, they have characteristics of their own. The wine with a marked aroma and more body is the red port. White port may be lacking in these qualities to a certain degree but certainly makes up for them by its more refined taste and mellowness. Besides the choice in the color, you can have your port dry, sweet or semisweet. You will find that even though port is a wine, it has many characteristics of a liqueur, due to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">aguardente</span><span class="font13"> added while fermenting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Port wine is under strict control of the Institute of Port Wine,-which insures quality, issues certificates of origin, and supervises all export of wine. The wine must have 19 to 21 percent alcohol by volume, so at times more brandy is added to make the desired strength. Then the Institute has “tasters” to check the quality. They are not interested in quantity. Many times what we may consider good wine will not be shipped out as port wine because it does not meet the high standards. The tasters get samples of many different ports, not knowing from which winery they come. A sip of wine is taken, swished around in the mouth allowing the taste buds to react, then spit out. These men know wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So you can enjoy a glass of port at almost any time of the day. The sweet port makes an excellent dessert wine. To one making a social call port wine is usually offered. If you feel you need a tonic or a sedative to calm your nerves, port wine may be the answer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RECIPROCATING</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">STEAM LOCOMOTIVE</span></p><img src="g_E_19590508_files/g_E_19590508-7.png" alt="" style="width:258pt;height:190pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">_ _NE of the most fascinating pieces of mechanical equipment man has ever made is the reciprocating steam locomotive. Reciprocation means an exchange of acts, a mutual giving and returning, and thus can be well used to identify the backward and forward motion of the pistons and rods that cause a wheel to rotate through the action of a crank. It is very interesting to most people to watch this type of engine work because its parts are operating in full view, but when we see these power plants applied to a railroad locomotive, pulling hundreds of tons of freight at high speed, or hustling a passenger train along at upward of eighty miles an hour, the impression of its ability to accomplish tremendous tasks is great. While it is true that more power per ton of fuel can be obtained through the use of Diesel, electric, or some of the later steam-turbine locomotives, yet these engines do not capture the imagination in the same way as the reciprocating engine does, for there is no impression of the power that makes the wheels rotate. Let us go down to the railroad yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">See, here is a four- or five-hundred-ton giant that has just come in trailing a hundred cars. What a feeling of tremendous power, held captive in the great boiler, we get as we hear the hiss of a jet of steam forcing the draught of the furnace as it hustles the smoke up the short smokestack, and note the air pumps pulsing to replace the pressure just now expended in bringing nearly a mile of freight cars to a stop! Look toward the front end of the big machine. Do you see the great cylinders, one on each side, bunched up like the tremendous shoulder muscles of a monstrous giant? Now, do you notice the shining piston rods protruding from the center of each cylinder in the direction of the driving wheels? Notice that these correspond to the upper arms of man. Now look at the rods that connect the ends of the piston rods to crank pin bearings on the outside of one pair of driving wheels —for all the world like giant forearms and hands gripping the crank handle of a wheel. And do you also see the long horizontal side rods coupling all the pairs of driving wheels together? These spread the power of the pistons over a larger surface of wheel tread and rails. You are looking at something that has fascinated and intrigued millions of people during the past hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Like thousands of other persons, as you notice the engineer reaching into nooks and crannies with a long-spouted oil can and then climbing back into the cab, you wonder what it would be like to ride with him and watch the manipulation of the scores of controls you glimpse within, to send this thundering monster on its journey across the countryside. But there is the signal to go. Slowly he pulls a little on the long throttle lever so as not to apply too much power at the start and cause the great wheels to slip, but admitting the steam pressure into the cylinders easily and steadily. Slowly the piston rods push</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">out, one a half stroke ahead of the other, and the cranks begin to turn the great wheels. Back the rods move into their cylinders, slowly and steadily, and then come out once more, and the movements are accompanied with full-throated, roaring chuff, chuff, chuff, chuffs, as the exhaust steam, in great clouds, rushes free at last from the intolerable pressure of the boiler back into the air from where it had originally come. With a steady gathering of speed, the impression of a living giant, slaving in the interests of man, its master, becomes stronger. We do not wonder that this steam giant has so captured the imagination of boys the world over, that many of them keep their youthful interest on into their adult years and, as members of amateur railroad clubs, operate working models of engines and track systems, with all the various items of controls and rolling stock, just as if they were actually working for a real railroad system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ho tv It Developed</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Did you ever wonder about the development of this vital form of transportation and think about the when and why and how of it all? There is so much history, geography, drama, tragedy, social development and industrial expansion in association with the subject that many volumes of books would be required to tell us all about it, so let us just touch the high spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We can trace the idea of a steam jet pushing a vehicle to Sir Isaac Newton in the year 1680. By 1770, Nicholas Cugnot of France experimented with a steam-powered, heavy wagon for hauling artillery along roads. Following this. James Watt applied steam power to the problem of keeping coal mines pumped dry enough to enable them to be worked. Auxiliary engines were also coming into use to assist horses in hauling heavy loads up inclines around the mines. About this time crude tracks were being laid from mines to canals, it having been found that horses could pull much more coal, ore or rock in trolley cars, than by using wagons over roads. In 1803, Trevithick’s steam locomotive appeared, designed to pull more of these loads than horses could. It did, handling ten tons of iron, five wagons and seventy men, at Pen-y-darran, near Merthyr, Wales. It had no resemblance to today’s engines. Its cylinders worked indirectly, and the power was brought down to the drive wheels through gears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By 1807, Fulton was applying steam power to boats over in America, and steadily the required knowledge of this new science was building up. Hedley’s &quot;Puffing Billy’’ appeared in 1813, to be followed by Stephenson's “Blucher” in 1814. Next, in 1829, George and Robert Stephenson built the famous “Rocket.” It developed twenty horsepower, operated on a boiler pressure of fifty pounds per square inch, and pulled a carriage of people at twenty-four miles an hour. In this engine we can trace the design that has now become so familiar to us all. It utilized exhaust steam to increase the heat of the furnace by the simple expedient of sending it up the chimney, and its power rods worked direct onto the wheels by fixed cranks. This engine won an open competition after several days of tests, and can now be seen at the Science Museum, at South Kensington, London, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Stockton-Darlington Railway was now developing and, due to the work of Stephenson, soon discontinued the use of horses for passenger haulage, and steam took over. Wooden rails surfaced with strips of iron, and the short fish-bellied rails, something like the grates in a furnace, soon proved impractical and the development of the modern type of rail began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Opposition to the new method of transportation flared up and then began to die out, and in due time illustrations comparing a derailed locomotive, and passengers scrambling desperately for safety, with horse-drawn coaches gliding serenely and safely along in obvious superiority, began to cease, and those who prophesied the end of all things in clouds,of smoke and scalding steam, with trains hurtling down into the Apocalyptic abyss, began to be discredited and ignored. Stronger boilers, bigger engines, faster speeds, all came into being, and engines developed into two general classifications, the heavier, smaller wheeled, more powerful and slower freight types, and the larger wheeled, higher geared, lighter engines for faster passenger service. The “Flying Scotsman” is a modem example of this latter type. So as the century rolled along, first industrial areas and later cities and rural areas were linked together with a network of steel. Actually, the industrial revolution was a power revolution, and the reciprocating steam engine provided that power.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Use in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Meanwhile, in America, some crude trolley tracks had come into use for the same reason as in Britain, enabling horses and mules to pull heavier loads to canals. But with the eastern range of mountainous country, canals could be built only to the north and from the Hudson to the Great Lakes. This meant that millions of acres of empty land lay idle, while the population tended to bunch up along the Atlantic seaboard. Forward-looking men began to see the possibility of steam locomotion through the mountain passes, to develop the rich lands to the west and south. So we note that in 1829 the “Stourbridge Lion” was imported from England and, built by Foster Rastrick and Company, was the first steam locomotive to operate in America. Next came the “Best Friend,” claimed to be the first engine built for actual commercial operation in America, also the “Tom Thumb,” which lost its early lead in a race with a horse-drawn rail coach due to a mechanical mishap, enabling the horse to win. “John Bull,” another Stephenson product, was imported in 1831, and again sound, lasting principles of design were seen in this engine. Matthias Baldwin patterned “Old Ironsides” after its general design, and it, in turn, served well for some twenty years. Soon the combination of better railroad track and more knowledge of the science of steam power began to show results. It is claimed that by 1837 the “North Star” became the first engine to exceed sixty miles an hour. Longer boilers and more driving wheels appeared on the scene, the “Madison” of 1860 having two pairs coupled together, and Winan’s “Camel,” in 1863, connecting four pairs together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With the end of the Civil War and the following depression subsiding, attention was again turned toward settling the many empty areas of the country, and this period saw longer trackage and increasing size of both locomotives and trains. Mountain types of engines had to be designed, and the problems of long grades and sharp curves led into the Mallet articulated design. This Swiss engineer designed what amounted to two engines, free to move separately, under the one long boiler. Thus weight and power were increased and good cornering maintained.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Continued Improvement</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now the trend is to bring the mighty freight locomotives more in line with passenger train speeds so that perishables are whisked along at speeds undreamed of a few decades ago. All this has meant higher steam pressures, some engines working on 300 or more pounds per square inch. Incidentally, a speed record of 112.5 miles</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">an hour is claimed for &quot;Old 999” in the </span><span class="font13">year 1893. In America today there are giants of over 500 tons weight, 140 feet long, including the tender, from five to six thousand horsepower, and capable of performing at a hundred miles an hour. Their appetite for coal or oil fuel, and water, is seen from the tremendous capacity of their tenders, which tag along with twenty-five to thirty tons of fuel and a refreshing drink or two of some 25,000 gallons of water. No fireman could feed such a glutton with a shovel, so for many years now automatic stokers have taken over the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Economy with the steam generated has received much thought, particularly for when the locomotive has gathered speed and momentum. This has meant a development of the valves that admit the steam alternately into the cylinder on each side of the piston and that provide an outlet for it when it has expended its power. Stephenson’s shifting link motion was used for many years, but the use of Walshaert's motion, driven from the crosshead (elbow), and an eccentric crank, has brought improvement. Being on the outside of the wheels, it is far easier to keep lubricated. We must also mention the automatic coupling, which has saved so many hours of tedious and dangerous handwork and has proved to be one of the big advances made in railroading. Mention must also be made of the air brake, which eliminated the laborious task of scrambling from car to car to apply each individual mechanical brake. Now the engineer controls all brakes simultaneously by a valve in the cab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In America, as elsewhere, there is a large variety of designs of locomotives, but, large or small, they are all classified according to the number and disposition of their wheels. For instance, a 2-4-2 would simply mean that there would be one pair of leading wheels, two pairs of driving wheels and one pair of trailing wheels. A mountain-type Mallet could be 4-S-8-4. Notice a few different types of engines and you will soon get the idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are about three quarters of a million miles of railway Jines, or tracks, in the world today and, mindful of the marvelous ingenuity of man in making the mighty locomotives to run on them, one could easily conclude that these rails, in every land, would all be laid the same distance apart. But not so. Too often men do not agree when there is an opportunity to disagree. The standard width of track, known as the gauge, we regard as four feet eight and a half inches, and this is used in England, America and Canada. Ireland has a gauge of five feet three inches and, in case you should smile at the Irish railroad, Spain and Portugal use one of five feet six inches, and Russia, five feet. Some other lands may vary from three feet to five feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For more than a hundred years the reciprocating steam locomotive has done enormous volumes of work; it has spread man’s physical and cultural horizons. But today other types of power and other modes of transport have taken over in many places. What the future holds for steam-locomotion, we will have to wait to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Jaywalker</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">New York city Magistrate Manuel Gomez, when ruling on a jaywalking case recently, told about the origin of that word used in the United States to refer to people who walk across a street without paying attention to traffic rules. The magistrate said the term was derived from Colonial times when “the jerry bird or jay bird was looked upon as a very dumb bird that performed dumb acts.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">corner bordering on Lake Victoria. Though seeming small on a map of Africa, Kenya, with its 224,960 square miles is 10 percent larger than France and 85 percent as large as Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Other topographical features of Kenya that should be mentioned are its Longonot, an extinct volcano, and its Rift Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The former rises 9,000 feet to the brim of its crater, which has a circumference of eight miles and a depth of 600 feet. It is well worth the effort to climb to the top to see the inside of this gigantic</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Kenya was named after its Mount Kenya, a name that comes from the African’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kilinyaa,</span><span class="font14"> meaning “White Mountain.” The beautiful mantle of snow that clothes its jagged peaks makes the name truly a fitting one. To the Africans living in its shadow Mount Kenya is the dwelling place of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">ngai<sub>r</sub></span><span class="font14"> “god.” With its height of 17,040 feet, Mount Kenya is Africa’s second-highest mountain, being eclipsed only by Mount Kilimanjaro, 19,565 feet, just across the border to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A striking feature of Kenya’s landscape is the great masses of rock that violent volcanic activity threw up from the level plains in prehistoric times. Through Kenya’s center runs the equator, to its north lies Ethiopia and to its south </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Tanganyika. </span><span class="font14">It extends west from a four-hundred-mile shoreline on the Indian Ocean some five hundred miles to Uganda, its southwest </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">basin. As for the Rift Valley, it is a part </span><span class="font14">of the Great Rift Valley, a depression or subsidence of the earth’s surface, that extends from the Jordan Rift Valley of Palestine in the north, down through the Red Sea, through Kenya and on into Lake Tanganyika. In Kenya this valley is from two to three thousand feet deep and from thirty to forty miles wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As for Kenya’s climate, north of the equator it is hot and dry, making the region largely an arid waste in parts of which rain docs not fall for several years at a time. South of the equator there are found three kinds of climate: hot and humid in the coastal region; temperate in the highland region, which ranges from three to ten thousand feet in elevation; and tropical in the area adjoining Lake Victoria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Years ago Kenya, together with Uganda, was known as British East Africa. Today some authorities still refer to the two, together with Tanganyika, by that name. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">And not without good reason, as the three </span><span class="font14">colonies are under British jurisdiction, use the same currency and have common postal and telegraph systems. In passing it is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font14"> interest to note that in 1905 Britain offered the Zionists 6,000 square miles in this region for their homeland. Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, was eager to accept this offer but not the Russian Jews. They stalked out of his Congress and refused to return until he assured them that he would hold out for. a homeland in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>tts Bistory</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Regarding the native people of Kenya and other parts of Africa Sir Philip Mitchell, a past governor of Kenya Colony, once stated: “They had no wheeled transport, . . . they had no roads or towns; no tools except small hand hoes, wooden digging sticks and the like; . . . they never heard of working for wages. They went stark naked or clad in the bark of trees or the skins of animals, and had no means of writing, even by hieroglyphics ... Perhaps the most astonishing of all to the modem European mind, they had no calendar or notation of time . . . they are a people who in 1890 were in a more primitive condition than anything of which there is any record in pre-Roman Britain.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Afrika,</span><span class="font14"> Anton Zischka.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yet in 600 B.C., Egyptian ships sailed through the Red Sea, and in the days of Jesus Christ there was a seaport named Tonike, where today Kenya’s chief harbor city Mombasa is situated: a thriving city of some 100,000 inhabitants and boasting the best harbor on the eastern coast of Africa. Arab colonization of Kenya is believed to have begun about the eighth century when Vasco da Gama explored its coast on his way to India. During the following century the Portuguese gained control, holding it until 1698, when the Arabs regained possession of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The modern development of Kenya by the British dates from the end of the nineteenth century. Britain felt it in her interest to build a railway, at the cost of well over five million pounds, from Mombasa clear across Kenya to the shores of Lake Victoria, covering 587 miles of largely mountainous country. This line ascends to 9,150 feet at Timbora, the highest railway station in the British Commonwealth, and descends to 3,726 feet, the level of the lake. Mombasa’s fine harbor and this railway lured British settlers to Kenya.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Inhabitants—Native and Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As regards Kenya's inhabitants there are four main divisions with each having its subdivisions: Arabs, Indians, Europeans and Africans. The several thousand Arabs reside chiefly along the coast. Some 65,000 Europeans dwell mainly in the ‘ ‘White Highlands.” Scattered far and wide are the 200,000 Asiatics, mostly from India, having been brought in by the British for the development of the country. The Africans number some six million, most populous being the Kikuyu tribe, which accounts for at least 20 percent of their number. Perhaps best known outside of Kenya are the Masai, a stately, tall and beautiful race who are not only fine warriors but also great herdsmen. They keep their cattle not primarily for the meat but as symbols of wealth, for milk and for the blood which they draw from the cattle and drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Kenya’s multiracial society is not lacking in variety. Its people speak many languages. Among the “Europeans,” in addition to English one can hear French, German, Italian, Greek, Polish and Afrikaans; among the Indians are heard Urdu, Gujarati and Punjabi. Add to this the many tribal tongues of the Africans and you have a picture of polyglot confusion. However, while the different peoples hold to their own languages, they all use one common medium of expression, the Swahili language, which is used all over Eastern Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A wide variety of religious beliefs is also found in Kenya. The various sects of Christendom have established many missions. Among the Arabs and Indians are many Moslems, and the Ismaili sect, which recognizes Aga Khan, has a large community in Kenya. There are also many Hindus, and the bearded and turbaned Sikhs are conspicuous everywhere. While the missions have gained close to a million nominal adherents and more and more Africans are embracing Islam, the great majority of Africans are in bondage to witchcraft and other forms of pagan religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It appears that it was primarily this bondage to pagan religion that was responsible for Kenya’s greatest tragedy in recent years, the Mau Mau rebellion. By means of pagan terrorism unscrupulous agitators ‘ exploited the Kikuyu’s grievances and upon pain of death forced many into taking blood-curdling oaths to support the Mau Mau in their ruthless savagery. While the avowed purpose of the Mau Mau was to rid the country of the white man, comparatively few Europeans were killed. In fact, during the emergency more Europeans were killed in road accidents in Nairobi than were killed by the Mau Mau, the majority of victims being Kikuyu who refused to go along with the terrorists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Today the Mau Mau conflagration has all but died out. Embers of it smolder, however, as noted in the report in the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font14"> February 18, 1959, on a trial based on the charge that the leader of the Mau Mau, one Kenyatta, was convicted on bribed testimony. This may result in the reopening of his case. Also, there is another secret society, the K.K.M. (Kiama Kia Muingi), coming to the fore that claims to have the same goals as the Mau Mau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is also much activity on the part of the more moderate members of both the European and African communities to work out their differences, which gives reason to hope that good judgment will prevail over intransigence and racial fanaticism. Taking the lead in this are such men as the minister of agriculture, Michael Blundell, who settled in Kenya thirty-three years ago, and an American-educated Kikuyu, Dr. Gikomyo Kiano. Endeavoring to help in this regard, the queen of England visited Kenya in February, 1959.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Government and Industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The capital of Kenya is the rapidly expanding city of Nairobi of some 220,OCX) inhabitants. Situated in the White Highlands at an altitude of 5,450 feet, it has a pleasant climate. It has modern buildings, at least one ten stories high, an up-to-date international airport and a well-equipped drive-in cinema. Also a serious auto parking problem and such an acute housing shortage that many upon arriving have to stay at hotels while waiting and searching for homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Politically Kenya consists of a Colony and a Protectorate. The latter is a strip ten miles wide that is leased from the Sultan of Zanzibar, an island close by Kenya, and for which he receives an annual rental of 10,000 pounds. Both Colony and Protectorate are administered under the British Colonial Office by a Governor, a Deputy Governor and a Council of Ministers. There are also an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The policy of the government is to gradually give the African more and more to say in governing himself; this policy, however, suits the extremists of neither side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The government operates primary and secondary schools, for which fees are</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">charged. To assist with medical expenses it has a hospital contribution scheme on a scale graduated according to income. Most commercial firms have their own medical insurance schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As for industry, Kenya depends largely upon agriculture, among its chief crops being coffee, sisal, tea and pyrethrum, the latter being a basic ingredient of insecticides. However, efforts are being made to develop industries such as in chemicals, clothing; hardware, plastics, tobacco and glassware. At present Kenya is suffering from a trade recession, common the world over, so that there is a surplus of labor, but industry still needs skilled men and qualified professionals and technicians. The general run of trade and white-collar jobs are well cared for by the Asiatics, often to the chagrin of aspiring Africans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Doubtless best known of all is Kenya’s big safari business based on its wildlife paradise. Thousands come each year from all parts of the world to hunt with gun or camera. Within a few miles of Nairobi you can see in its Game Park at close range such animals as giraffes, zebras, ostriches, baboons, crocodiles, hippos, gazelles, lions, leopards, cheetahs, all in their natural habitat. Most popular are the lions, who are so used to humans that it is possible to drive a car alongside them and quietly watch them. Particularly fascinating is it to watch their cubs at play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An even more excellent tourist attraction is the Amboseli National Reserve, where good accommodations can be had at the Safari Lodge at O1 Tukai. Africa's highest mountain, the snow-capped dome of Kilimanjaro, provides an impressive background to this game reserve. In addition to all the animals that can be seen in the Nairobi park, here are also elephants, rhinoceroses and buffaloes. Walt Disney’s “The African Lion” was filmed here. In fact, films with an African setting have become very popular in recent years and Kenya has had many Hollywood and European stars filming on location. Nor to be slighted are the beautiful beaches of Kenya with their picturesque crafts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is, however, another activity going on in Kenya that should not be overlooked, the most vital of all, that of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. As the 1959 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font13">shows, here also Jehovah God is blessing the efforts of his servants to bring comfort to men of good will that are conscious of their spiritual need by telling them of Jehovah’s name and kingdom. They find many more persons than they can care for who welcome the opportunity to have someone teach them the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">C Every parent knows that the natural tendency of children is to do what they like and to avoid doing what they do not like. The first everyday problem of every parent is to teach his children to do the things they should do, whether they like them or not, and to avoid doing the things they should not do, even though they like to do them. The truth is that children believe in parental discipline. A survey of 96,000 high school pupils in 1,300 schools in the United States revealed the clear-cut opinion that parents should carefully restrict their teen-age sons and daughters as to hours, frequency of dates, places of amusement, choice of associates, smoking and drinking.

<p><span class="font14">HIS is the world’s most interesting [snake,” once said America’s noted reptile authority Raymond Ditmars of the king cobra. “It is the most dangerous of all living wild creatures. Combined with the deadliness of its fangs, it is extremely active and commonly inclined to attack. Coupled with insolence, sometimes prompted by curiosity, 'but more often by anger, is an intelligence that renders it unique.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Would you like to know more about the famous (or infamous) reputation of the cobra known as king? Well, then, we can start with the matter of beauty, for the king cobra is rated as one of the world’s most beautiful snakes. This slender, graceful serpent is usually olive or yellowbrown; its color pattern may also include ringlike crossbands of black or markings of an orange-red color. Enhancing its beauty is its length, for this is a king-sized snake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of all the world’s poisonous snakes, none come close to the “king’s” maximum length—between eighteen and nineteen feet. Its more common length is. twelve to fifteen feet. But even without this impressive length king cobra would be spectacular enough, as it is the business end of this snake that makes it so interesting and formidable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The brand of poison king cobra manufactures is one of the most potent snake poisons in the world. Only a very few snakes in the world have a more potent poison. Recently </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font14"> published a list of poisons with their potency rating. Potency was based on the amount of poison required to kill a man. The rating for the cobra was 20 milligrams (after its poison was dried);</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">for the mamba 20; for the coral snake 5; for the Australian tiger snake 2 and for the krait</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">1.5. It is interesting to note that the most poisonous, the krait, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">one of the most inoffensive of snakes; and the coral snake is often called sluggish. The tiger snake, on the other hand, is aggressive and rivals the king cobra for deadliness. But what the king cobra lacks in potency (and it can hardly be called a lack!) it makes up for in length, athletic ability, intelligence, aggressiveness and king-sized poison sacs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The poison sac of the tiger snake is said to contain about 47 milligrams, that of the common cobra about 300 milligrams or twenty drops and that of the king cobra more than 450 milligrams or about thirty drops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When king cobra bites he injects several lethal doses at a bite. And what bites! The ordinary poisonous snake merely makes a quick bite and lets it go at that. Not so king cobra! He bites and then hangs on, injecting more and more poison until much or almost all of the poison in its king-sized glands is emptied into its victim. “No other snake injects so much poison and no other snake does so thorough a job of destroying its victim,” once said Frank Buck of “bring ’em back alive” fame.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Curiosity and Intelligence</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It may be that the king cobra’s curiosity adds to its dangerousness. It likes to investigate things carefully. Perhaps man feels that the king cobra has a strong, curious nature because, unlike other cobras, it operates during the day, living in the dense jungles of Asia and adjacent Pacific islands. When king cobra examines something, its bronze, round eyes are, as Dit-mars puts it, “disconcerting in their intense stare.” Occasionally, he says, “it will rear four feet high and stand as motionless as a great candlestick, staring fixedly. There is none of the nervous swaying or marked arching of the neck of the common cobra. The attitude is one of intense scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For a snake, king cobra seems to have unusual intelligence. It uses this intelligence in making itself a regal living; in fact, because of its menu it gets its name “king.” Its menu is simply snakes and more snakes. Come what may, smaller cobras or other kinds of serpents, king cobra will eat them. Probably no other snake lives on such a virtually exclusive serpentine diet as does king cobra. Though probably immune to most poisons, king cobra seems to avoid long-fanged serpents, knowing that they could inflict a nasty wound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In captivity “king” displays remarkable intelligence; Raymond Ditmars uses the word “singular.” He writes in his book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Snakes of the World:</span><span class="font14"> “I have observed many demonstrations of the singular intelligence of the king cobra—and am using the word ‘singular’ because other snakes do not act this way. A newly arrived captive soon detects the character of glass, which covers the front of its cage. . . . Captive examples appear to recognize the persons who care for them, yet evince antagonism towards strangers.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Searching for Humans to Hite?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">King cobra’s reputation for attacking and pursuing man is notorious. Just how aggressive is this cobra king? Opinions vary. Frank Buck, who had traveled the world In search for animals, wrote in </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bring </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">’Em Back Alive:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Nowhere in the world is there an animal or reptile that can quite match its unfailing determination to wipe out anything that crosses its path. This lust to kill invests the king cobra with a quality of fiendishness that puts it in a class by itself, almost making of it a jungle synonym for death. One is always thinking of it in terms of loss of life. I find myself recalling a hundred and one instances of its destructiveness. ... I can't get out of mind, for instance, the picture of a big water buffalo, a fine robust specimen weighing about 1,500 pounds, that, walking through a rice </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">padi,</span><span class="font14"> had the misfortune to step too close to a ridge where a six-foot king cobra lay coiled up. The uncompromising reptile struck out and the buffalo was dead in less-than an hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Though elephants have thick hides, they are sometimes bitten on vulnerable places such as at the tip of the trunk; then this mammoth creature dies in about three hours. A king cobra bite is fatal to man within a half hour to an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As to “king’s” aggressiveness, there are hundreds of stories confirming it. But the Englishman N. W. F. Tweedie, who has had considerable experience with king cobras, believes that their savagery is definitely overemphasized. He cites examples of king cobras that were far from aggressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As a species, though, king cobras are exceptionally aggressive. Many reports indicate, however, that these belligerent displays take place after some kind of disturbance. One account tells of a hunter in India who saw a king cobra about twenty-five feet away. It seems that the cobra had first spied the man, because it was reared up about three feet above the ground, carefully scrutinizing the man. After surveying the situation for about a minute, the king cobra slithered off away from the hunter. But the hunter hurled a stone at the serpent; it struck the snake on the back of the head. Quite understandably king cobra was furious. It took off for the hunter with deadly intent, but a heavier stone hurled by the hunter landed on the snake’s neck. It was a crippling blow, and the hunter easily killed the cobra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That king cobra will pursue man there is little doubt, but more often than not there is some exciting factor. Says Raymond Ditmars: “There is no doubt about its fearlessness, nor about its disposition to quickly advance and attack if interfered with, but it seems rash to form the conjecture that the average king cobra pursues man on sight.... The explanation of attacks of this serpent appears to largely revert to the breeding season. . . . [Then] these snakes are extremely savage and hostile at human intrusion, will rise from the ground four to five feet, angrily hiss, and some among their numbers come straight at the person blundering upon their lairs. This is probably the basis for this reptile’s extremely bad reputation, coupled with its insolence in preferring to fight rather than flee if man or domestic beast brushes actual contact with it when prowling.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Snake That Builds a Nest</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Nonetheless, this reptile authority believes that king cobra’s intelligence, athlet</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ic quality and deadliness make it prudent </span><span class="font14">for anyone passing through its known domains to proceed with great caution. This is especially so during the breeding season, when the king cobra, demonstrating another unusual trait, builds itself a “nest.” It is not much more than a heap of leaves, probably shoved into position by sideways movements of the snake’s body. Mrs. King Cobra then lays twenty-one to forty eggs in the bottom of the nest. She remains on guard, coiled in an upper compartment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One can well imagine how Mrs. King Cobra will react if man or elephant should disturb the nest. In </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">All About Reptiles </span><span class="font14">W. S. Berridge writes: &quot;Captain G. H. Evans, in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society,</span><span class="font14"> tells us that a Burmese who happened inadvertently to disturb a brood of them was chased by the female. He ran away as fast as he could towards a river, into which he plunged and swam across. He then clambered out on the bank, but was terrified to see that the snake had followed him, and was reared up, ready to strike. Fortunately the man had the presence of mind to take off his turban and throw it at the serpent. Upon this it wreaked its vengeance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not without reason the cobra known as king is called “the most dangerous of all living wild creatures” as well as “the world’s most interesting snake.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Hair</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;L &quot;The average adult scalp,” says the volume </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Dermatology,</span><span class="font13"> “contains about</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">120,000 hairs—blondes about 140,000; redheads about 90,000; and brunettes about</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">110,000. Scalp hair grows at a rate of about one-half to three-quarters of an inch per month. Long hairs grow more slowly than short ones. The average life of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">a scalp hair is two to six years. The healthy scalp loses a certain number of hairs every day and a normal scalp begins to grow a certain number of new hairs every day, the rate of loss and replacement varying from person to person, and from time to time in the same person.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">What About the Rich Man and Lazarus?</span></p><img src="g_E_19590508_files/g_E_19590508-13.png" alt="" style="width:143pt;height:20pt;">
<p><span class="font21">T</span><span class="font13">HAT is a favorite question asked by those who hold to the teaching of eternal torment for the wicked. Thus clergyman W. Ray Duncan begins his arguments in his forty-eight-page booklet </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">An Answer to No-Hellism</span><span class="font13"> by quoting all of Luke 16: 19-31, the account of the rich man and Lazarus, as the best possible proof of eternal torment for the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And a tract entitled “So You Don’t Believe in Hell!” also starts out by quoting: “And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments . . . And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, . . . for X am tormented in this flame.”—Luke 16:23,24, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">AV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What about these arguments? Are they sound? Do those words of Jesus prove that eternal torment is the fate of the wicked? No, they do not. Why not? Because Jesus obviously here was speaking a parable. In fact, only by understanding that point does what he said make sense. Besides, are <sup>we </sup>not told that “without an illustration he would not speak” to the crowds? There is even some evidence that Jesus made use of a parable that was current in his day. —Matt. 13:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In examining the parable let us note first of all that nothing is said about the rich man as being wicked; only that he dressed and dined well. Neither is anything said about Lazarus as being a Godfearing man, but only that he was poor and covered with ulcers. Nowhere does the Bible teach that it is wicked to be rich. Abraham was a very wealthy man; so were Job, King David, Solomon and Joseph of Arimathea. Nor is poverty in itself a virtue. In fact, the wise man tells us that many a man’s poverty is due to his own foolishness or laziness.—Prov. 20:13; 24: 32, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Next we read that both died. The poor man, Lazarus, was taken by angels to sit in Abraham’s bosom, whereas the rich man went to Hades, there to suffer fiery torments. Is it reasonable to conclude that Jesus meant that Lazarus literally sat in the bosom of Abraham? How could that be when Jesus plainly stated that, at least up to the time he was on earth, no one had ascended into heaven?—John 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If what happened to Lazarus is not to be taken literally, then why put a literal construction on what Jesus said happened to the rich man? Hades is literally the realm of the dead or gravedom and corresponds to the Hebrew word </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font13"> concerning which we are told: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going”—regardless of whether you are good or bad.—Eccl. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Further, to hold that any at death go to a burning hell would be to belie God’s judgment of sinner Adam: &quot;Dust you are and to dust you will return.” It also contradicts the apostle Paul’s plain statement that “the wages sin pays is death.” More than that, the apostle Peter likens the wicked to brute beasts, to “unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed.” Does eternal torment or annihilation await the lower animals? Peter says that the same fate awaits the wicked. —Gen. 3:19; Rom. 6:23; 2 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides, did not Jesus say: “Do not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">w</span><span class="font13">-vel at this, because the hour is coming in</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment’’? If at death man goes to either heaven or hell, how can it be said that at some future time Jesus will call all the dead forth from their memorial tombs?—John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then what is the application of this illustration? The rich man or Dives, as he is sometimes called, well represents the clergy of Jesus’ day who were well provided with spiritual riches; men who considered themselves children of God’s kingdom, figuratively clothed in purple, and who claimed to be righteous, pictured by the white linen Dives wore. On the other hand, Lazarus pictured the Jewish common people whom the religious leaders despised as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">am ha-a'rets,</span><span class="font14"> “people of the earth.” Of them the Jewish clergy said: “This crowd that does not know the law are accursed people.”—John 7:49. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then death, as it were, came to each class—picturing what? A change, even as the apostle Paul indicates at Colossians 3:3: “For you died, and your life has been hidden with the Christ.” What brought about this change? Jesus’ preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. By reason thereof many of the Jews became the spiritual remnant of Jewry and were given the hope of the heavenly kingdom, becoming part of the spiritual seed of Abraham that is to bless all the families of the earth.—Gal. 3:16, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At the same time Jesus’ expose of the clergy caused a change to take place in their lives. From their state of selfrighteousness and luxurious ease they were brought into such a state of torment that they had no rest until they had put the Son of God to death.—Matt. 21:45, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And what about the chasm between the two? This pictures Jehovah’s righteous judgments which cannot be changed as regards the two classes. (Mark 3:28-30) As for the five brothers of the rich man, these well picture the associates of the Jewish clergy who manifested the same spirit as the Pharisees. In that these refused to believe Jesus they refused to believe Moses, for Moses wrote of Jesus. Jesus said that even if one was raised from the dead these would refuse to believe, and so it proved to be: both Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, and Jesus himself were raised from the dead, and still they refused to believe.—John 12:10, 11; 1 Cor. 15:3-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All of this finds a striking parallel in our day. Again there is a clergy class that flaunted its spiritual riches and that has been reduced to a state of being tormented by the preaching of the truth by God’s servants. And again there is a lowly Lazarus class that has experienced a change to God’s favor particularly since 1919. Since then these anointed witnesses of Jehovah have been preaching the good news of God’s established kingdom. By reason of their preaching, hundreds of thousands of others, men of good will, have been privileged to share in the comfort enjoyed by the modern Lazarus class, otherwise termed *in the Scriptures “the remnant.” And today, too, we see the associates of the rich man, the politicians and men of industry, finance and commerce, also refusing to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thus we see the various details of this illustration of the rich man and Lazarus having a twofold fulfillment, further proving that Jesus uttered a parable, not a historical incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all,—Eccl. 9:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&amp; The territory of Hawaii, 2,000 miles from continental U.S., was approved, on March 9, for statehood by a vote of 323 to 89 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Just the day before, the Senate had given its approval by a vote of 76 to 15. On March 18 U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaiian statehood hill. Before actually becoming a state, however, Hawaii must hold a referendum approving statehood, to be followed by primary and general elections. President Eisenhower will then issue a proclamation of the territory’s acceptance into the Union. Hawaii's population of 578,000 is made up of persons of pure and part Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese, Caucasian and other racial backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Turmoil in Tibet</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&gt; Reports reaching New Delhi on March 20 revealed that a revolt against the Communist Chinese had broken out in Lhasa, capital of remote Tibet. The whereabouts of the Dalai Lama, religious and temporal ruler of the Tibetans, was unknown. Some sources felt that he mitht be a prisoner of the Chinese Communists, whereas others thought that he might be directing the revolutionary movement from some remote area. On March 25 the Kashag, Tibet’s cabinet, declared the country to be independent and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese Communists. The Communists have directed Tibet’s military and foreign affairs since the enacting of a treaty granting them those controls on May 23,1951. Thubten J. Norbu, a brother of the Dalai Lama, said that about 90 percent of his country’s populace were resisting Communist domination. Those who refuse to enter collective organizations are told to get out, according to Norbu. &quot;'Those who can ride horses flee to the hills,” he said, '‘those who are left -the old, the very young and the women—are machine-gunned by the Chinese.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Project Argus</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On March 19 it was revealed that in early September the U.S. had exploded three atomic devices about 300 miles above the South Atlantic. The experiment, carried out by the U.S. Navy under the supervision of the Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission, was called Project Argus. The detonation of the three atomic devices resulted in a globe encircling blanket of radiation, The explosions also caused various auroral displays. The radiation from the blasts had enveloped the earth in less than an hour and had apparently lasted for several weeks. Project Argus was lauded by one source as &quot;the greatest scientific experiment ever conducted.&quot; Though inconclusive and incomplete, data obtained by these explosions showed widespread interference with radio and radar. They also provided scientists with considerable information about the earth's magnetic field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The French Vote</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Municipal elections were held in France on March 8 and 15. In the first of these, covering thirteen major cities, Communists obtained 27.7 percent of the popular vote. On March 15, however, in 38,000 municipalities throughout the country, the Communists received only 16,3 percent of the total votes. The newly elected municipal councilors would make up a considerable number of the electors in the French Senate and thus this is where the election results would largely be felt.</span></p>

Commenting on his discussions with Eisenhower, on March 23 Macmillan said that these were “the best conference we ever had.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-Rule for Northern Nigeria </span><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Northern Nigeria achieved internal self-government on March 15. It was the last of the country’s three regions to do so. Nigeria, with a total population of about 30,000,000, is to become a completely independent country in October, 1960. It covers an area of about 373,000 square miles and is Britain’s largest colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Vote In Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; The United Federal party received considerable backing in the March 20 elections in Northern Rhodesia. Incomplete reports showed that the party, headed by Sir Roy Welensky, had won thirteen of the twenty-two elected seats in the Legislative Council. The United Federal party is against African nationalism. Welensky’s apparent victory is considered a further step toward the nation’s achieving dominion status within the British Commonwealth. Welensky expects Northern Rhodesia to attain this status by 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Rojas Found Guilty</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On March 18 the Colombian Senate, by votes of 62 to 4 and 65 to 1, found Lieut. Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla guilty of violation of the national constitution .and abuse of power during his administration as president of that nation. Rojas had taken power in a military coup in 1953, but was ousted by a military junta in 1957. Though at first he had fled from Colombia, he returned in October, 1958. A Senate committee was set up to fix a sentence for the country’s expresident.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Rebel Regime in Maldives</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; A revolutionary government over what was termed the United Suvadiva Islands was set up in the Maldives early in March. A spokesman of the rebel regime gave “misrule and imposition of new high taxes on almost everything&quot; as reasons for the revolt. The rebels were reported to be in control of three southern atolls of the Maldive group. Though the Maldivian government promised to act against them, the insurgents were not dealt with immediately. The Maldives are 450 miles southwest of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean. They have a population of about 82,000, though most of the 7,000 islands in the archipelago are uninhabited. The Maldives, under British protection since 1887, became a republic in 1953. After a coup in 1954, however, a sultanate was established headed by Sultan Al Amir Mohammed Farid Didi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Strong Presumption”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">4&gt; In a note to Moscow on March 23 the U.S. held that there was a “strong presumption” that the Russian Ashing trawler Novorosslsk had been responsible for breaks in five trans-Atlantic telephone and telegraph cables near Newfoundland between February 21 and 25. A U.S. naval boarding party had invoked provisions of the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables in investigating the Soviet Ashing vessel. Moscow had protested the boarding on March 4. In its note the U.S. held tha the cables had been severed by cutting and &quot;that the evidence in its possession raises a strong presumption that the master and crew of the Soviet trawler Novorosslsk had violated Article </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font13"> of the Convention of 1884.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Seaway Tolls*</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On February 12 Canada and the U.S. announced an agreement on tolls for the St. Lawrence Seaway. The tolls, to go into effect April 1, are thought to be sufficient to cover operating costs and to liquidate construction debts. Certain rail, port and shipping interests, however, have called the fees unrealistically low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Indian Uprising</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'$&gt; The council house of Ohswe-ken, capital of the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, Canada, was seized by a group of Indians on March 5. In 1924 the Canadian government withdrew the Indians’ tribal rights to rulers hip by hereditary chiefs and established a twelve-man council to administer affairs of the reserve. Chief Joseph Logan, Jr., and his followers, numbered at about 1,000, hold that their reserve, twelve miles square, is but a portion of the land grant given them by King George III of England in 1784. The tribes comprising the Six Nations, with a total population of about 6,000, are the Cayuga s, Mohawks, Oneidas, Onon-dagas, Senecas and Tuscaroras. Though at first the Canadian government took no action, the Indians were ousted from the council house by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after about a week’s occupancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Contact with Venus</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;&amp; In a report issued on March 19 eight physicists of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revealed that success had been attained in making radio contact with Venus. The experiments had taken place on Feb-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ruary 10 and 12, 1958* The intervening months had been spent In isolating the signals thorn static picked up in space. This was the first time a radio beam had ever been bounced off a planet. According to electronic computation there is less than one chance in 10,000,000 that the signals received were not actually those that were sent. In addition to revealing certain things about the surface of Venus, a planet enclosed in cloud layers, the experiment is viewed as a considerable stride toward more accurate measurement of inter-planetary distances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Antarctic Land Mass</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At one time it was believed that Antarctica was made up of a number of islands covered over by a great body of ice* In the latter part of 1958* however, a Russian expedition trekked from Mirny on Antarctica's Knox Coast to a point approximately 1,400 miles inland, called the &quot;pole of relative inaccessibility?’ About every thirty to fifty miles the Russians made soundings of the icecap by setting off dynamite charges* By this means sound waves were sent down through the ice and echoes were received from the land masses underneath. The experiments revealed a large continuous land area under the icecap. It appears that the topography of Antarctica’s continental land mass varies from 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level. In some areas the ice covering is about 3,000 feet thick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;(tospel of Thomas”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In 1946 peasants discovered in an earthen jar, about sixty miles from Luxor, Egypt, a number of leathcr-bou4d papyrus manuscripts in the Coptic language. Among these was the &quot;Gospel of Thomas.” It is an apocryphal writing that is not a part of the Bible. After thirteen years of research scholars have revealed that it contains 114 sayings attributed to Jesus Christ. Some of these are said to agree word for word with the canonical Gospels* Others are variations of Jesus* sayings recorded in the canonical Gospels, and there are some that are unknown and are not found in the true Gospel accounts. Commenting on the s i x t e e n-hundred-year-old document, Dr, Oscar Cullman, a professor of Early Christianity at the Sorbonne in Paris, says that the Gospel of Thomas &quot;was rightly not included in the New Testament*” &quot;Our four canonical Gospels are the only ones on which we can rely,” said Cullman, adding, &quot;Again and again we must marvel at the fact that from the large number of primitive Christian writings only those were accepted as canonical which really came from the oldest time and which were free from heretical tendencies,”</span></p>

FIELD MINISTRY
“I am awake!” people will often say, and no doubt they are awake to many things. Yet how easy it is to overlook matters vital to one’s well-being! To aid people to be awake to matters of greatest importance, during October Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for the magazine Awake! for $1. New subscribers will receive free three enlightening Bible booklets.
A STUDY OF GOD’S PURPOSE
Here are two extremely popular aids in your study of the Bible, “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. Each provides a thorough study of God’s purpose on the theme expressed in its title. Both are hard-bound editions, beautifully illustrated, with gold-embossed covers. Both will be sent postpaid on your contribution of $1.25. Send today and receive free the two booklets God’s Way Is Love and God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?

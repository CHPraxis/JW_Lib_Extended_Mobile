FIELD MINISTRY
March is the third month of the Watchtower campaign. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere will continue to offer this vital magazine to persons of good will at $1 for a year’s subscription, giving three free Bible booklets to each new subscriber. Encourage your friends and neighbors to subscribe for The Watchtower; it will help them to learn how to gain life in God’s new world. For further instructions on how you may share, go to the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses
TRUTH BENEFITS THOSE WHO SHARE IT
Truth is little thought of in these days of exaggerated advertising, misleading political promises and deceptive international relationships. Yet there are still many persons who appreciate its worth. That is one reason for the astounding growth in circulation of the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Are you availing yourself regularly of the benefits to be had from their dedication to this outstanding virtue? You can be! Send only $2 and you will receive both magazines for one year. Send at once and receive as well free six stimulating booklets on the Bible.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It is the will of God,” say many when faced with heart-breaking events. How sadly they misconstrue God’s will! And when praying to God, “Your will be done on earth,” few realize that God’s will for earth means the restoration of paradise. To aid all persons of good will to get such important Bible knowledge, during December Jehovah’s witnesses will offer the two books <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth” </em>and <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, </em>with two booklets, for $1.25.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FOR DAILY READING</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For daily reading you should have the 1960 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>Not only does it contain stimulating experiences of the Christian ministry world-wide, but it also provides daily consideration of God’s Word through the Daily Texts and Comments. In this popular portion of the <em>Yearbook </em>a text of the Bible is quoted for each day, followed by comments from <em>The Watchtower </em>of the year 1959. Send 50c for your copy today. Also, you will want the 1960 calendar, beautifully illustrating the year’s text. Send 25c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“When God Speaks Peace to All Nations” is the title of the featured talk at the 1959 Awake Ministers District Assemblies. All together, four days of vital information have been arranged for by the Watch Tower Society that will be shared by thousands of active ministers and those with whom they are studying the Bible, as well as other persons who are of good will toward Jehovah God and his new world of righteousness. You will want to join these thousands in attendance throughout the United States and Canada at the convention city nearest you. In spite of world conditions and a threatening future, there is real hope for those who put their trust in God’s provision. Hear it discussed at any one of the assemblies scheduled. For details write WATCHTOWER CONVENTION, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn 1, N. Y.</p>

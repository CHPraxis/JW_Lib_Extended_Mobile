<p><span class="font24">H</span><span class="font16">APPINESS is determined to a large extent by our receiving with appreciation. Unthankful and unappreciative people are not happy. How could they be? If one is unthankful, he is likely to be discontented and among those who are “complainers about their lot in life.” —Jude 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is not surprising that many persons are victims of unhappiness, discontent and complaining, since so many persons are unthankful toward the Source of our greatest blessings, Jehovah God. Yes, we have come to the time, the “last days,” when the apostle of Christ said that men would be “without gratitude.” Since there is widespread ingratitude to the great Giver, we can readily understand why so many persons receive goodness at the hands of their fellow man without appreciation. —2 Tim. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One may show sincere appreciation by reciprocal kindness. Said the Lord Jesus: “Practice giving, and people will give to you.” There is also the matter of the heart moving the mouth to express the gratitude that one inwardly feels.—Luke 6:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Children should be trained to receive with appreciation at an early age. It is easy enough when one is young to overlook appreciation. Commenting on his own experience as a youth, Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote in his </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of Childhood and Youth:</span><span class="font16"> “I am haunted by an oppressive consciousness of the little gratitude I really showed [people] while I was young. How many of them have said farewell to life without my having made clear to them what it meant to me to receive from them so much kindness or so much care! . . . Down to my twentieth year, and even later still, I did not exert myself sufficiently to express the gratitude which was really in my heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So kindnesses should not be taken for granted. Do you have precious privileges? These also should not be taken for granted. Do not let the regular enjoyment of them blunt your appreciation. Show appreciation by proper use of privileges. Do not abuse them. Be moderate in all your ways. One may regularly receive transportation through the kindness of a person with an automobile. There is a danger that the regularity of the kindness may dull one’s appreciative response. Guard against assuming that appreciation, once expressed, is now permanently understood and need not be expressed again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How can a dulling of appreciation for privileges and kindnesses be detected? There are symptoms of discontent and complaint. The Israelites in the wilderness, for example, murmured against the miraculous manna provided by God. They received this gift from God regularly. In time they lost their appreciation: “The mixed crowd that was in the midst of them expressed selfish longing, and the sons of Israel too began to weep again and say: ‘Who will give us meat to eat? How we remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the watermelons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic! But now our soul is dried away. Our eyes are on nothing at all except the manna.” Now how did this lack of appreciation manifest itself in a most serious way? “The people kept speaking against God and Moses: ‘Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread and no water, and our soul has become disgusted with the contemptible bread.’ ’’—Num. 11: 4-6; 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So receiving without appreciation can lead even to speaking against God. Christians want to bless God. They are taught to be thankful for the gifts that come from God’s hands through his Son. By regular expressions of thankfulness the Christian guards against complaining against God. “In connection with everything give thanks.”—1 Thess. 5:18; Eph. 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">No matter what our status in life, we have much for which to be thankful. The Bible tells us how ten lepers once came to Jesus Christ, saying: “Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!” Jesus healed them. Yet how many received this great mercy and kindness from God through his Son with appreciation? Only one, a Samaritan. This one fell upon his face at Jesus' feet, thanking him and “glorifying God with a loud voice.” This one person who expressed his thankfulness must have received with appreciation even while he was a leper. In his diseased state he had much for which to be thankful; and so when this big thing happened in his life—the miraculous healing^—he did not receive it without appreciation.—Luke 17:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Every day'in our life should be a day of thankfulness. The true Christian does not limit his thankfulness to special occasions or special days. Take, for example, America’s “Thanksgiving Day.” Does it set the right pattern for daily thankfulness? Are the celebrants of this day primarily thinking of God or of themselves? Are they showing thankfulness to God by overeating and overdrinking? If they were really thankful to God, they would feel a sense of obligation to do something in return. When we appreciate' what someone has done for us, we feel attached to that person. But does this world or its masses of “Thanksgiving Day” celebrants feel attached to God? Why, the masses of Christendom do not even want to acknowledge their dependence upon God. They want to feel free and independent. Having attained what they view as success by their own brawn and brain, they feel no need to thank God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Christendom’s masses are not only ungrateful for the natural mercies of God but they also depreciate the gift of God’s Son, the kingdom of God and the messengers of that kingdom. Those who really receive with appreciation should be glad to hear the Word of God, glad to learn of the glorious good news of the established kingdom. In spuming the Kingdom good news, the masses show their true heart condition, that this is true of them: “Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” —Rom. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So God will wipe out this world of people “without gratitude.&quot; Do not copy this world in its ingratitude. Always receive, from man and from God, with appreciation. This is the way of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Vjunbelievabl^ ■ ^ eXclaimedFufhiko, She could&quot; perhaps be excused for saving this, for it was the first time she had looked up at Tokyo Tower. However, it was real, for there it stood, all 333 meters of it. Moreover, if someone had told Fumiko’s mother and father, when they were her age, that someday they would sit in the parlor at home and watch swmo or baseball through the telecasts from Tokyo Tower’s antenna, they too would have exclaimed, “Unbelievable!” But no longer can they say this, for television has become everyday fare to them. And if Fumiko’s family could once say, “Unbelievable!&quot; what would the knights of Edo have said a hundred years ago had someone told them that so tall a giant as Tokyo Tower would someday grace the Kanto plain?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Let us climb even farther back through history to the days when the daimyo ruled, and the Genji and Heiki clans were fighting it out. Supposing we could have told those warriors that someday men would replace their glittering swords and spears with hollow sticks that could shoot death out over</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">-r ' Pl<sup>ace</sup> i<sup>n</sup> the world in a time. Our forebears of a years' back wbuld have exclaimed, “Unbelievable!” We who live in the latter part of the twentieth century are compelled to say, “Believable—and utterly horrible!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When face to face with the unheard-of, or when told of something not yet experienced, man is always inclined to exclaim, “Unbelievable!” Indeed, many of the great scientific discoveries of history have excited this comment, and in some cases newly discovered facts of science or new inventions have met with bitter opposition from those who preferred not to believe. When man began to emerge from the “dark ages” and to discover that the earth was round, and not flat, the Roman Catholic Church preached against it. When Galileo invented the telescope in the early seventeenth century, learned “fathers,&quot; fearful of the new discoveries, refused to look through it, and preached sermons to the text, “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?” However, despite the unbelief of the clerics, the trie-scope was a fact, and the discovery that the earth was a planet among sister planets was also true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When the “iron horse” or locomotive appeared in the nineteenth century to compete with the fleshly horse, there were some who declared it was possessed of a demon. However, unbelievable or believable, demonized or not, the locomotive has spearheaded more that a hundred years of industrial and economic development, and has enabled millions to take in the pleasures, as well as the discomforts, of travel throughout the continents. Would our ancestors of Tokugawa times have believed this possible? Certainly not! Nor would Magellan’s men, who toiled for years at sea to circumnavigate the globe, have believed that jet planes would someday circle the earth in forty-eight hours’ flying time.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Natures “Unbelievable^''</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Nature itself is full of the unbelievable. Unless he were told of it, what diner on the succulent eel would believe that there is such a thing as the electric eel? However, if he visited South American rivers and grabbed one of these slimy creatures, both the desire for dinner and the disbelief might be shocked out of his system with a 700-volt punch! Moreover, recent research has brought forth the “unbelievable” discovery that the electric eel uses electric impulses, much as man uses radar, to detect the presence of objects in the water many feet removed from the eel. Do you say, “Unbelievable”? It may be unbelievable, but it is true, and modem naval men would give millions of dollars to know the secret of the eel's “radar” system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Like the electric eel’s “batteries&quot; and “radar,” many wonders of earth outdate man by millenniums, and yet man is only now beginning to fathom their secrets and copy them in his modem inventions. Radar in the eel and sonar in the bat, jet propulsion in the squid, the pin-point navigation system of the migrant bird, the helicopter-like flight of the hummingbird and the air-conditioning system of t^e beehive are only a few of the wonders of nature that have become “modem inventions” of science, even though they existed in the animal world long before the creation of man. All of this makes it believable that a Master Intellect, a mind far greater than man’s, thought out and brought forth these marvels that fill all nature. Moreover, this same Master Intellect placed in nature all the astounding resources and forces from which the inventions of modem man originate. The great pity is that man uses these wonders first for destruction, instead of for construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does someone still say, “Unbelievable that a Master Intellect, an almighty God, created it all”? However vigorously the atheist and agnostic may cry “Unbelievable!” all the facts unite to answer back: “Believable and indisputably true!”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Believe Bible’s Record of the Future</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Jehovah God, the Master Designer and Builder, is also the Master Author. Even more wonderful than all the glorious creations in nature, and the uses to which natural resources are put in bringing forth modem inventions, is the incomparable record contained in God’s Book. The title of that Book? It is called the Holy Bible. It is the most scientific book on earth today. It is the only scientific book that does not need to be rewritten every ten or twenty years, to bring it up to date with latest research. Though it started to be recorded 3,500 years ago, all its parts are still as reliable, and today they are even more valuable to us than in the day the Master Author inspired men to write this book. Do some say, “Unbelievable”? If they will make the effort to study the Bible, they too win be compelled to say, “Entirely believable and true!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As an example, take the prophecies of the Bible. Many moderns glibly parrot the word “Unbelievable!” when they are told of the global tragedy of Armageddon that is about to befall mankind. It is the same “Unbelievable!” that the self-satisfied world of Noah’s day parroted when God’s prophecy warned of the approaching flood. However, who was right on that occasion? “By faith Noah, after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household, and through this faith he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.” (Heb. 11:7) The unbelievers found a watery grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When Ezekiel, Jeremiah and others prophesied the destruction of apostate Jerusalem, the wicked populace refused to believe. (Jer. 26:8, 9; 28:10, 11) However, those prophecies came true with unerring accuracy, even to the restoration of a remnant of the Jews to Jerusalem exactly seventy years later. (Jer. 25:11) Afterward the restored Jerusalem again became apostate. Jesus prophesied concerning its destruction, but the populace professed disbelief, mocking him on the torture stake: “Bah! you would-be thrower-down of the temple.” (Matt. 24:1, 2; Mark 14:58; 15: 29) However, as Jesus prophesied, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman army A.D. 70, over a million unbelievers perishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As it throws its searching beams down into this twentieth century, Bible prophecy again undergoes remarkable fulfillment in the catastrophic events of the nuclear age, including the power struggle between the communistic “king of the north” and the democratic “king of the south.” (Luke 21: 25, 26; Dan. chapter 11) It tells that we stand at the threshold of the complete elimination of all the wicked from the earth, in Jehovah’s war of Armageddon. Though no Bible prophecy has ever yet failed of fulfillment, &quot;wise’’ ignoramuses continue to cry, “Unbelievable!” Bible prophecy thunders back in answer that “by the word of God” this entire wicked world of the space age will suffer destruc-? tion. Its fiery demise is just as certain as the annihilation that befell the corrupt world of Noah’s day and the two apostate cities of Jerusalem. (2 Pet. 3:3-7) Nor will the most hypocritical system of all, the bloodguilty Christendom that has indulged in every crime that is unchristian, escape Jehovah’S judgment. (Jer. 7:12-15; 14:13-15) Unbelievable? You may live to see these prophecies come true, just as every previous page of Bible prophecy has had its certain fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Throughout history, men faced with some innovation, with a new experience or with Bible prophecy, have been inclined to cry, “Unbelievable!” How often has the unbelievable tqyned out to be true! Unbelievable as all the wonders of modem scientific development would seem to men of a few years ago, these wonders are now with us, as tangible proof that they are true. Unbelievable as Bible prophecies have sounded to some who first heard them, they have always come true with astounding accuracy. Now these same prophecies point unerringly, not only to the destruction of the entire wicked system that now controls the earth, but also to the establishment of an earth-wide society of peace and happiness. That great change is in the immediate future. Fumiko, her father and mother, and countless other persons of good will, now have opportunity to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, to learn of these great wonders yet in store for mankind, and to say, &quot;Belieyable and true!” Marvels yet unheard of are about to unfold before the eyes of God-fearing men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">breadth of the country is the mighty Congo River with its many tributaries. This giant of rivers can be likened to the backbone of the Congo. Concerning it the stilloperative Congo Basin Treaty of 1885 defines “that the trade of all nations shall enjoy complete freedom” over the wide area watered by the Congo River and its affluents, including Lake Tanganyika. The Congo River is not only the greatest river , _ in Africa, but also the world’s second largest, being exceeded only by the Amazon of South America.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">The Congo River discharges almost four times as much water into the Atlantic as does the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico. Though not as long as the Nile, it boasts of some 2,900 miles, rising remotely in Northern Rhodesia. It has more</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font16">IE Belgian Congo truly is a giant, a giant both in size and in natural resources. With its more than 900,000 square miles, it is one third as large as Australia, more than three times as large as Texas and seventy-six times as big as its mother country, Belgium. From the map you can see that it lies right in the heart of Africa, extending from its twenty-five-mile shore line on the Atlantic Ocean on the west to Tanganyika on the east, and from the Sudan on the north to Northern Rhodesia on the south. It extends from about 5° north to about 12° south of the equator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The British explorers David Livingstone and H. M. Stanley figured prominently in the history of the Congo. Then how did the Congo become a Belgian colony? Due to the astuteness, we are told, of King Leopold II of Belgium. Politically the Belgian Congo is divided into six provinces, and ever since its inception it Jras been administered by a governor-general. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Transversing the entire length and than 4,000 islands, fifty of which are more than ten miles long. To what extent waterways are a feature of this territory can be seen from the fact that it has upward of 15,000 navigable miles, giving berth and passage to 3,400 vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Lying as it does within the equatorial zone, it is not surprising that most of the Belgian Congo is hot. Due to its ample rainfall and many waterways there is a certain amount of humidity, but one gets acclimatized after a while. Evidence of this is seen in the 107,000 Europeans of many nationalities that live in the country. As regards seasons, there is no winter or summer but, rather, dry and rainy seasons. In that part of the Congo south of the equator the rains commence early in October and finish at the end of April, with dry periods in between. These southern provinces are best suited for Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Over 13,000,000 native Africans live in this vast land, most of them being Bantus. Other races represented are the Sudanics, NiJotics and the Hamitics. A knowledge of Swahili, which is spoken by all natives who have had contact with the Arabs, will be very useful to the traveler, although he will run up. against many local native languages and dialects. The predominant religion is Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To the tourist or visiting businessman the Congo offers a variety of modem modes of travel. It is served by excellent overseas and internal air routes and by 3,254 miles of railways. While some of the provinces maintain but limited road transport facilities, others have extensive public auto transport services, carrying passengers, baggage and mail over a network exceeding 6,250 miles. Congo travelers have 85,000 miles of roads to use, some of the chief ones being equal to European standards.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Nature's Attractions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">The national parks of Central Africa are some of the most remarkable attractions in the world, combining as they do both abundant wildlife with magnificent scenery. Four of the most beautiful of these parks are located within a radius of just 180 miles. Within one of these, the Queen Elisabeth Park, there are some eighty extinct volcanic craters, seven of which contain water, while the others are the homes of game and are forested or covered with thick bush. The same attractions are to be found in the Albert National park, a gorilla and game sanctuary. This park, which, in 1935, was enlarged to a million acres, lies along the western shores of Lake Edward and stretches northward past a range romantically styled the “Mountains of the Moon.” Here all species of flora can be seen, from equatorial varieties to high-altitude plants. This park extends southward to the volcanoes of the Kivu, two of which are still active. From safe points of vantage it is possible to get a good view of these craters through the veils of sulphur gases and molten lava.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Safari! To many this word means merely a journey, but to others it means hunting. In the extreme north the plains of the Congo are full of buffaloes, wart hogs, elephants and even lions. In the estuary of the Semliki River, near Lake Albert, crocodiles and hippopotamuses abound. Farther south we have antelope as well as wild hogs and river hogs, and then, reaching the Luama region, we enter the leopard country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Licenses are necessary for hunting. The white rhinoceros, the okapi, gorilla and a few other species are strictly protected from hunting. But to many persons, hunting with a camera is more exciting and satisfying, and, it might be added, certainly more in keeping with Scriptural principles and man’s God-given dominion over the lower animals, all of which rule out taking the life of lower animals for sport. The cardinal rule for camera hunting is: Get as close as you possibly can to your prey, which can still be at a safe distance if you have telephoto lens on your camera. Besides animal shots there are other things of interest for the photographer, such as the famous Watutsi and Batwa dancers at Kisenyi, and, in the Ituri Forest, the pygmies in their natural state.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Leopoldville and the “Capital of Copped’</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">The capital of the Belgian Congo is Leopoldville, a fine modern-looking city with bright shops and adequate recreational facilities. Here, as in all the principal centers, there are government schools for the European children, as well as missionary schools operated with government support for the others. Twenty thousand Europeans live in this city along with 350,000 Africans. Though over two hundred miles inland, and land-locked, Leopoldville is a busy port, complete with docks and cranes, it being the downstream terminal for the heavy river traffic. It has a strong continental atmosphere, with its sidewalk cafes and its national tongues of Flemish and French. Right across the Congo River from Leopoldville lies Brazzaville, the onetime capital of French Equatorial Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While Leopoldville is the political capital, Elisabethville is termed by some the “Capital of Copper.’’ It originated and was developed owing to the discovery of important copper fields and was built on the site called Lubumbashi (after the name of a river flowing nearby). Elisabethville was founded in 1910 when the railroad from Rhodesia reached the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Today the city gives the appearance of a rich resort town, having a pleasant climate and residential districts surrounded by flower gardens. The average temperature is 69 degrees Fahrenheit. Compared to the rest of the Congo the climate of Elisabethville is relatively dry. It has good hotels, a music academy, museum, zoo, and so forth, being indeed a well-appointed city. The European population is 14,250, the African, 171,000. Nearby are the Lofoi Waterfalls. These drop in a single stream from a height of 1,115 feet, making them the highest vertical waterfalls in Africa, though not comparing with the mighty Victoria falls in width or flow of water.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Awakening Giant</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">The Belgian Congo is a rich country. True, it has to import many manufactured items, such as clothing, motor vehicles and machinery, as well as coal and petrol, or gasoline, but its exports far outstrip its imports. Coffee, gum, cocoa, coconuts and coconut oil, rubber, palm oil, skins, timber and ivory are among the products exported in quantity. But the big export business is in minerals, with copper at the top of the list. Other minerals include gold, tin, manganese, zinc, cobalt and diamonds from the province of Kasai. Included also must be radium from uranium ores, and silver. The annual output of gold is more than 11,000 kilograms (a kilogram is 2.2 pounds), and the annual diamond output is 12.5 million industrial carats and 600,000 carats in gem stones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As for agricultural products, these include tea, quinine, maize and pyrethrum. Areas ftee from the tsetse fly are suitable for cattle raising, and there are 386,000 head of European and nearly a half million head of native-breed cattle. These form the basis of a thriving dairy industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Focusing attention on the awakening of the Belgian Congo giant was the headline that appeared in the Rhodesian newspaper, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Northern News,</span><span class="font16"> May 15, 1959: “Congo Africans Move from Dark Ages into Atomic World.’’ Among other things, the article stated: “Belgium has established two multi-racial universities, one at Leopoldville and the other at Elisabethville. African students are leaping from the dark ages of the witch doctor into the atomic future. For next month the first nuclear reactor on the African continent will start producing radio-isotopes at the Lovanium University.’’ The government is aiming for eventual political independence for the Africans, although it “has refused to set any. time limit, or give any indication of its time-table for independence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, the Congo, which just eighty years ago was an unknown territory of vast forests, seemingly countless rivers and streams, and teeming with animal and insect life of every description, is, today, if the plans of the administrators are fulfilled, due to become one of the most advanced of the African territories. Nearly 14 percent of the four hundred million pounds (upward of $1 billion), to be spent in the second ten-year plan for the Congo, will go into the effort to make life easier and more prosperous for the African small holders. Economic planners are placing the main emphasis on aiding the millions of Africans living in the rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Livingstone, Stanley and others may have discovered the Congo, but today the twentieth-century planners are harnessing the many potentialities of this vast land. In view for the Congo River is a giant hydroelectric project that is awaiting final decision from Brussels. “An African Ruhr May Transfigure Belgian Congo,” is the way one newspaper headlined the striking report in which it was pointed out that the proposed Inga project to harness the water of the mighty Congo River would dwarf the Egyptian Aswan Dam and the huge Zambezi River power plant at Kariba. Engineers say Inga’s power potential is at least 25 million kilowatts, more than twenty times that of Kariba. It would be located between Leopoldville and the port of Matadi.—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Northern News, May</span><span class="font16"> 12, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In view of all the foregoing it can truly be said that the Belgian Congo is an African giant that is awakening. Because of this, technicians and other people of skilled trades are very welcome. The Office of Colonization (OFCO, 12, rue du Grand Cerf, Brussels) readily supplies information to would-be immigrants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the time of this writing religious liberty has not yet been extended in the Congo to that body of Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses. Nevertheless, they are active, and in Leopoldville six congregations of African witnesses function, and their persistency and faithfulness has won for them some recognition and permission to hold meetings. An evidence of the prosperity of their rapidly growing organization was that 1,417 attended a special talk on April 5, and over 1,500 attended the celebration of Christ’s death, or the Memorial, on March 23 of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As the Belgian Congo awakens to industrialization and economic activity, it is to be hoped that many of its inhabitants will benefit from a far more important awakening—to the significance of our times and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies. Doing so, they may hope to be among that “great crowd” from many nations and tongues who will be blessed with everlasting life in happiness in Jehovah God’s new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">“On the Side</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;L Discussing the bulk of Hollywood-made motion pictures and their effect on minds, H. A. Overstreet says in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Mature Mind: </span><span class="font15">“What Hollywood discovered—by rule of thumb and box-office returns—was that the sure-fire way to attract people (or at least, most of the people most of the time) is to give them compensatory illusions. Motion pictures bqpame the big business through which unsatisfied men, women, and adolescents in unprecedented numbers were granted a daydream fulfillment of their hopes. The motion picture did not aim to make these unsatisfied people go forth and take positive action to solve their own problems.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awakel” eorreipondent in New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">E fundamental freedoms of speech, ssembly and worship for minority groups in New Zealand were made more secure recently when the Supreme Court ruled that Jehovah’s witnesses are entitled to use public war memorial halls for the purpose of holding Bible lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Following this significant decision on August 21, 1959, newspapers throughout the Dominion carried two- and three-column headlines proclaiming: “War Memorials Are for Use of All, Says Judge’’; “Jehovah’s Witnesses Can Use Memorial Halls, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Judge</span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Says”; &quot;Freedom of Worship—Jehovah’s Witnesses Given Use of Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Here is the story behind this civil liberties case involving the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and the Mt. Roskill Borough Council, Auckland. In January, 1958, Jehovah's witnesses applied for the use of the Levin and District War Memorial Hall to hold a three-day Christian assembly. The Levin Borough Council was agreeable to this until the local Returned Services’ </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Association voiced</span><span class="font16"> a strong disapproval. The Association requested a lead from its Dominion executive committee, and on January 31, 1958,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16">a resolution was passed by </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the New Zealand</span><span class="font16"> R.S.A. It stated that “a War Memo-k rial is sacred to the memory of those who served their country in time of peril,” and continued </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font16"> an <sup>E</sup> emotion-charged appeal for their members to endeavor to influence those controlling such buildings to</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&amp; deny their use to Jehovah's witness-es, <sup>w</sup>h°&gt; it <sup>sa</sup>*d&gt; had been declared juT &nbsp;&nbsp;subversive back in 1940. However, they</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">failed to mention that that decision, being unfounded and unproved, had been revoked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The complete text of that resolution was published extensively by the press throughout New Zealand as was a reply by the Watch Tower Society. Urged on by the resolution, the Levin R.S.A. requested the Borough Council </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to reconsider its decision </span><span class="font16">to let the war memorial hall to Jehovah’s witnesses. The Council gave way to the R.S.A., and the contract was broken. The papers </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">widely publicized the action of both </span><span class="font16">Levin bodies, and many letters of protest from Jehovah’s witnesses were sent to the mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the meantime the R.S.A. circulated its resolution. Unwisely, many public officials allowed their eyeglasses of fairness, justice and tolerance to become smoked over by the fire of the R.S.A. and they barred Jehovah’s<sub>z</sub>witnesses from using war memorial halls. The Mt. Roskill Borough </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Council was sent a copy of the resolution </span><span class="font16">on February 24, 1958, and on April 3 the council notified the R.S.A. that a resolution had been passed prohibiting Jehovah’s witnesses from using the war, memorial hall. One council went so far as to say on its application for hire that the memorial hall would not be let </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to Jehovah's witnesses. </span><span class="font16">While a few councils resisted the pressure of the R.S.A., many others followed the course of discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If this continued it would mean that scores of memorial halls would be closed to Jehovah’s witnesses. What could be done? Should the narrow, prejudiced views of a few men be allowed to influence responsible councils to deny the Witnesses their freedom to have Christian assemblies in public halls for the purpose of hearing Bible lectures?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Test in Court</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">It was decided that such an important issue should be tested in the courts. The basis for a test case began July 8, 1958, when the Society made application to use the Mt. Roskill War Memorial Hall for a Bible lecture. The Council turned down the application. Legal aid was engaged, and on December 18, 1958, the Mt. Roskill Borough Council was advised of the Society's action against it. Before this case was heard another borough council broke its contract, as the Levin Council had done, with the result that the Society brought an injunction case against the Huntly Borough Council in April of this year. However, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Council, and Jehovah’s witnesses were compelled to make other arrangements for their assembly in Huntly. This aroused more interest in the controversy and it became a matter of public debate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the hearing of the case in May the Society’s lawyer, F. H. Haigh, argued: “This ban can be regarded as nothing less than fantastic and there is not the slightest justification for deciding that what persons did during World War II should be the test in 1958 regarding their rights with some utilitarian war memorial. The Council’s action is a denial of natural justice brought about by unjustified discrimination.’’</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Freedom Upheld</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">After certain procedural matters had been cleared up with the help of the Court, the decision in the case was handed down by Justice T. A. Gresson in the Supreme Court of New Zealand, Northern Judicial District, Auckland Registry, on August 21, 1959. It said: “This Hall. . . was financed by public subscription and grant from the defendant Council, which the Government subsidised in accordance with its policy of helping to finance War Memorial Community Centres. It was a condition of the subsidy ‘That the project be vested in the territorial local authority to ensure that the Memorial will always be available for the use of all sections of the community.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The judgment showed that Jehovah’s witnesses had used the hall in question for public Bible lectures three different times in 1956 and 1957 and that “on each occasion these lectures took place without incident or disorder of any kind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Justice Gresson observed: “It is not seriously disputed that in refusing plaintiff the use of the Hall the Borough Council was acting in deference to the wishes of the New Zealand Returned Services’ Association. It was doubtless greatly influenced by the fact that on the 24th October, 1940, the plaintiff body has been declared a ‘subversive organisation’ by the Attorney-General.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“On the 8th May, 1941, the Attorney-General modified his original declaration so, as to permit Jehovah’s Witnesses to hold meetings for the study of the Bible, prayer or worship ... On the 27th March, 1945, while the war was still in progress, the original declaration that Jehovah’s Witnesses were a subversive organisation was revoked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“The plaintiff body was thus allowed to hold its religious meetings in New Zealand for the greater part of the Second World War, and it has incurred no subversive stigma during the past fourteen years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Commenting on the beliefs and practices of Jehovah’s witnesses and the right of individuals to choose their own beliefs, Justice Gresson cited several legal authorities, including four judgments involving the Witnesses in England, Australia and Canada, and said: “Its ideology .,. stresses the absolute and exclusive personal relation of the individual to the Deity without human intermediation or intervention. ... Its attitude towards martial strife is one of strict neutrality ... it is important to record that Jehovah’s Witnesses did not engage in overt hostile acts, and their attitude towards military service was dictated by their conscience and their religious beliefs. ... As Latham, C. J., has pointed out; ‘The religion of the majority can look after itself. ... It is the religion or absence of religion of minorities, and in particular of unpopular minorities, which require the protection of the law.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">He pinpointed the issues on which the decision rested when he said: “The Minister of Lands vested the land upon which the Memorial Hall is erected in the Mayor, Councilors and Citizens of the Borough of Mt. Roskill for recreation purposes . . . and in trust for that purpose. . . . The defendant Council thus holds the land as a trustee for a special purpose and is not entitled to deal with it as though it held the land as an absolute owner. ..,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“The power to regulate admission would, in my view, include the power to prohibit admission on reasonable grounds, but legitimate regulation of admission must not degenerate into a mere means of discrimination or hindrance in the way of one class' from which other classes are free.... The Act shows quite conclusively that the administering body shall not so deal with the reserve that the public are excluded from free access thereto, and it is at least arguable that if public Bible reading can be regarded in the wide sense as ‘recreation,’ then in refusing plaintiff permission to use the Memorial Hall for this innocuous purpose, the defendant Council discriminated unjustly against it and infringed the spirit, if not the letter, of this Section. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“There is, however, another and in my view stronger ground upon which I prefer to base my judgment. The defendant Council accepted the subsidy ... on trust that the Memorial Community Centre would always be available for the use of all sections of the community, and maintained on as wide a community basis as is practicable. It cannot be disputed that the citizens of the Borough who are Jehovah’s Witnesses comprise a lawful section of the community, and, though in a relative minority, they must, in my view, enjoy the same legal rights and bear the same legal obligations as members of the Returned Services’ Association. In declining to allow the plaintiff the use of the Hall, the defendant Council in my view acted in breach of the wide terms of this trust.. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“In these circumstances I make the following declaration: ‘That the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and/or . . . are entitled to have access to the Mt. Roskill War Memorial Hall for the purpose of holding Bible lectures, at such reasonable times and upon such reasonable conditions as the defendant Council shall impose.’ ”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Victory Brings Loud Repercussions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">The wires of the New Zealand Press Association were hot with the news of the victory for Jehovah’s witnesses, and the next day all daily newspapers in both the North and South Islands carried the report. A few papers gave a thorough coverage of this outstanding decision, but the majority omitted the favorable comments respectfully made by Justice Gresson about Jehovah’s witnesses. The victory caused great rejoicing among the Witnesses, but what would be the attitude of the R.S.A. to this stinging defeat in the New Zealand Supreme Court?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The first published comment came from Palmerston North in a lengthy, two-column editorial in the Times of August 25. It remarked in part: “Though it will leave returned servicemen aghast and seem at least regrettable to most New Zealanders, there is now no doubt of the legal right of Jehovah’s Witnesses to share in the use of War Memoi’ial Halls where these have been built with funds subscribed by the public and subsidised by the Government. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“It would be inconsistent with the principles of freedom . . . that any section of the community, however controversial its beliefs, should be excluded from the use of public amenities to which it had contributed by way of taxes. Such exclusion would be a moral wrong on the part of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“While admitting this, we would like to add our emphatic opinion that the Jehovah’s Witnesses are themselves perpetuating a moral wrong in their unduly assertive insistence on their rights.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Judging from comments made continually to Jehovah’s witnesses, it is evident that hundreds of returned servicemen are opposed to the policy of the R.S.A., and there are thousands of other fair-minded people in New Zealand who, although not agreeing with the beliefs of the Witnesses, uphold their rights and express admiration for their fearless stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus, under the heading “Humble Pie Week at the Road Board,” the biweekly Waiheke </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Resident</span><span class="font16"> (Auckland) of August 31 said: “Mr. Justice Gresson gave a decision regarding religious discrimination by local bodies that has rocked our benighted members, all eight of them.,.. The Board, like a lot of weak-willed local bodies up and down the country, scurried to obey the R.S.A. when it told them that Jehovah’s Witnesses were not to be allowed the use of Memorial Halls. Mr. Gresson says the Witnesses have as many rights as the R.S.A; So the Road Board must now open the Waiheke Memorial Hall to the Witnesses or openly flout the law as they flouted the democratic rights of the Witnesses. Now the Witnesses can worship their God in their own way without being subjected to the tyranny of the Waiheke Road Board.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Also on Monday, August 31, in the twr, where the R.S.A. stirred up the controversy, the Levin </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font16"> reported: “The Levin Borough Council would have no option other than to grant the use of the Memorial Hall to Jehovah's Witnesses if an application was made. This opinion was given by the Mayor, Mr. E. W. Wise, when asked for his comments. , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Reference to the recent court decision was made at the quarterly meeting of the Levin R.S.A. Should the occasion arise where the Jehovah’s Witnesses wanted the Memorial Hall, would it be let to them? the member asked. The secretary replied: ‘We’ve no option now.’ Another question was: Did the decision apply to all memorial halls? The secretary replied that he considered it did.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then came an unexpected turn of events. On September 2 the Manawatu </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Standard </span><span class="font16">carried the two-column headline “R.S.A. Wants Government to Amend Regulations.” The article stated: “The New Zealand Returned Services’ Association is to make representations to the Government to amend the regulations to enable controlling authorities to prohibit the use of war memorials by organisations which have been declared subversive. This decision was made at a meeting of the Dominion executive committee of the R.S.A. last night after considering the recent Supreme Court judgment allowing Jehovah’s Witnesses to have access to the Mt. Ros-kill war memorial hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the same item there was an official statement of the R.S.A. accusing Jehovah’s witnesses of ‘impeding the defence of the country’ and saying they &quot;did their best to subvert others from so doing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The reply of the Society’s branch office to these false charges was printed in the New Zealand </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font16"> of September 5. It' protested against the move of the RJS.A. to nullify the effects of the decision of the Supreme Court, pointing out that hundreds of returned servicemen and their families would be included among those discriminated against. The article showed that Jehovah’s witnesses have never been proved guilty of subversion, but their position has always been one of strict neutrality. As evidence of the well-established position of Jehovah’s witnesses, it quoted from their book &quot;Let </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True”</span><span class="font16"> which says: ‘It is wrong for Christians to be subversive and (to engage in subversive activities. Jehovah’s witnesses do not oppose the desire of any person to serve in the armed forces. Nor do they oppose the efforts of any nation to raise an army by conscripting its manpower.’ Jehovah witnesses are a law-abiding people, who follow the command of the Lord Jesus: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”—Luke 20:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For many years Jehovah's witnesses have been using all types of halls, including war memorials, without any trouble. Even a number of local R.S.A. groups were renting their private halls to the Witnesses. Then suddenly in January, 1958, the Dominion executive committee threw a bombshell at Jehovah’s witnesses by passing an unjust resolution asking public officials to discriminate against them. Since then it has not ceased throwing verbal and printed hand grenades at the Society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Because Jehovah’s witnesses have appealed to the courts of law to protect their civil liberties some say that the Witnesses are “perpetuating a moral wrong in their unduly assertive insistence on their rights.” But is it a moral wrong to avail oneself of the freedoms guaranteed by law? Is it wrong to take steps to safeguard the rights of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of worship? In many communities public war memorial halls are the only ones available or suitable for certain assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses, and in applying for these Jehovah’s witnesses are asking only for what they are entitled to have as citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This momentous decision of the Supreme Court has made the basic freedoms of speech* assembly and worship more firm in this land, not only for Jehovah’s witnesses but for all people, especially the minorities. Jehovah’s witnesses are very grateful for the equitable decision that establishes these rights and they urge all to respect and act in harmony with that decision. They are determined to stand uncompromisingly for the Christian principles of the Bible and to continue preaching the good news that God’s kingdom, the kingdom of heaven, is now established and is the only hope for mankind.</span></p><img src="g_E_19591122_files/g_E_19591122-9.png" alt="" style="width:203pt;height:208pt;">

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font16">breath of air!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Maybe it was the first thing you were conscious of this morning when you were awakened, and, stretching, arose to meet whatever the day might bring. But did you consider where it came from and why it is here? What is it like, and how do we use it—this air that we breathe? Or were you so preoccupied with news reports of the inventions and tests of the scientists, or the strain of this age of materialism, or, in general, the demands of life that you thought nothing of it? But you are glad that you kept on breathing, are you not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is true, we are in the “space age.” Our very life seems stepped up to a startling, unprecedented pace. Yesterday’s most fantastic dreams are today’s realities. Vocabularies are swelling with new words. Advertising is geared to ‘finding one’s orbit.’ Sound, heat, and “controllability” barriers of the atmosphere have been either overcome or reduced to mere “areas of difficulty.” Sputniks, Pioneers, Explorers, Vanguards and others have made their contributions, and, instrumented as they are, are aiding in fields of scientific research. Successful launching of these satellites has been followed by efforts to retrieve them, and even to man them, first with one of the canine family, then with monkeys and mice. Now the recently named National Aeronautics and Space Administration has selected seven test pilots, one of whom will be cliosen for a space flight perhaps in 1960. As early as 1957 a thirty-two-hour flight “to pave the way for space travel and to determine man’s adaptability to live in space” was made by an Air Force major who soared at an altitude of nineteen miles above the earth. The officer in charge of the experiment said that the trip proved that men can live outside the earth’s atmosphere “by taking their own atmosphere with them.” So while ideas hitherto labeled ridiculous, such as staking out claims on Mars, booking passage to the Mcon, ox going to Venus this summer, do not seem so farfetched these days as in bygone years, nevertheless, the need for air to breathe on the proposed instruments ■ of conveyance, these little rocketed capsules, is pinpointed and is admittedly great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We cannot escape it: if we are to continue living as human creatures we must breathe. And there is one satellite that has been in orbit for undisclosed millenniums of time, is still in orbit, and, according to the very highest Authority, will always remain in orbit; and it is surrounded by an atmosphere that man can breathe. It is more than just coincidental that it is this “space-traveling” earth that we live on!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Earth’s Atmosphere and</span><br><br><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>the Air We Breathe</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Gaseous, thin, highly elastic, easily set in motion, and apparently nonexistent on a calm, sunny day, the atmosphere is confined to out planet by gravity. This very force, in view of man’s difficulty in making space ships to overcome it, seems to Invite us not to be too anxious about leaving this planet; but rather; to tarry, carefully consider, and appreciate how truly wonderful its atmosphere really is. Its very abundance bespeaks the generosity of a loving Creator, and the dependence of all plant and animal life upon it indicates the consideration of an all-wise Workman, A very brief record, kept through the ages, bears eloquent testimony of its creation, saying: “And God went on to say: ‘Letan expanse come to be in between the waters and let a dividing occur between the waters ahd the waters.’ Then God proceeded to make the expanse and to make a division between the waters that should be beneath the expanse and the waters that should be above the expanse. And it came to be so.’’ (Gen. 1:6, 7) This happened on the second day of preparing this earth for man’s home. By the end of the sixth creative day, this expanse or firmament or atmosphere had been clarified of its carbon vapors and had become just right for earth’s caretaker, man, to breathe. The exact thickness of this vast dome of air about us is not known definitely, but, according to some authorities, there is evidence that it extends for several hundred miles beyond earth’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Here at the crust of our satellite we find ourselves at the very bottom of the sea of atmosphere, this mixture of gases divided into seventy-eight parts, by volume, of nitrogen, twenty-one parts of oxygen (so essential to life), and one part of water vapor, inert gases and carbon dioxide. This' air that we breathe—tasteless, odorless, invisible—is the lower layer, the troposphere, of the marvelous, globe-encircling atmosphere, and extends, it is said, from four miles above the earth at the poles to eleven miles at the equator. These miles of it, plus the miles in the “blue yonder” of other layers of atmosphere—the stratosphere, mesosphere, and ionosphere—cause a tremendous pressure, namely, fifteen pounds per square inch at sea level; however, this pressure is exerted equally in all directions and, due to the internal pressure oi the human body, is not felt. So we breathe with delightful ease. Easily compressed, the air at earth’s surface is of greater density than at higher altitudes. Temperature decreases from the equator to the poles and from earth’s surface upward to the top of the troposphere. Could we ever doubt that it is an especially prepared medium peculiar to our earth?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Breathing Process</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">How can we avail ourselves of its benefits, taking in its oxygen, so vital for life? It is in answer to this question that one of life's many interesting processes holds our attention; a process set in motion by none other than the great Creator who made the atmosphere, and who proceeded to “blow into his [Adam’s, the first man’s] nostrils the breath of life.” (Gen. 2:7) Individually, we humans, so ’wonderfully made in a fear-inspiring way,’ from birth to death, minute after minute, day after day, year after year, whether awake or asleep, whether conscious or unconscious, continue to benefit from that process as we breathe.~Ps. 139:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Observation and analysis of the procedure fills one with awe and wonder. When an anxiously awaited newborn baby arrives, his little lungs are solid, for he has not used them yet; but they are there, ready to unfold and expand if he is normal. The crucial moment arrives! He is now an independent individual! Will he be able to 'breathe? Either the cold air that now surrounds him or the carbon dioxide accumulating in his own body stimulates the tiny brain, and that welcome, waited-for cry is heard. The mouth opened, the air rushes in to fill the lungs, at least partially, and the breathing process, now set in motion, is off to a good start. From then on, as long as he lives, his lungs will never be completely empty of air. As he grows and is allowed to cry, within reason, his lung power develops more and more. Sometimes he may go into a “tantrum,” holding his breath until he gets some attention, either in the form of a dash of cold water in the face, a quick slap on the provided place, or his own bewilderment as he “comes to,” regaining consciousness. Wonderful, is it not, that even if he should become unconscious for the lack of air, the accumulated carbon dioxide in his blood stream will “ring the bell” and the impulse sent to the brain will start him breathing again!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The organs of respiration, so marvelously correlated, function throughout the life span of the individual in a most fascinating manner. That it might be strained of dust, tempered to more nearly body temperature, moistened to just the right degree, the air passes through specially prepared passageways. The external nostrils, lined with hair, start this conditioning, filtering process. From there' on through the nasal cavities (and is it not nice that there are two, in case one does not function for some reason?), over the pharynx, through the trachea, bronchi, and lungs to the very tiniest air cells, the vigil is never relaxed. The fibrous, muscular windpipe, the bronchial tubes and the bronchioles are lined with mucous membrane, and on the inner surfaces with mucus bristling with minute, lashlike processes called </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">cilia, </span><span class="font16">which vibrate with an upward and outward movement expelling any invader that becomes entangled in the viscid secretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After reaching the lungs (whose function was so graphically set forth in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> of June 8, 1952), the air, amounting to some four hundred cubic feet daily, or the entire volume of a seven-and-a-half-foot cube, is channeled through the fine tubes or bronchioles into the air cells covered with capillaries. Here, where the amount of surface exposed to the air has been so greatly increased that it is estimated to be one hundred times greater than that of the entire body, is where the carbon dioxide of the blood is exchanged for the oxygen of the air. By contraction of the chest muscles the impure air is pushed out, or expired, and the partial vacuum created is ready for the next breath forced in by atmospheric pressure. And how we are stimulated! Does anything more exciting take place in the scientist’s laboratories?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Let us remember, too, that from the time we come into the world, whether we are rich or poor, we continue to inhale and exhale. Suppose that we had to pay, oh say, one cent for every breath. It is generally accepted that during the first year we breathe forty-four times a minute, that is if we are in normal health but not exercising at all. Our lowest possible cost for that first year would be $231,164. By the fifth year this rate of intake has been cut to twenty-six times per minute; but even so, that would amount to $136,656 annually. Gradually this figure tapers off and somewhere between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five this filling and partial unfilling of the lungs attains and from then on maintains the average, normal standard of eighteen times per minute—costing $94,608 per annum. But imagine—living a life without exercise! What parent could be happy to see its child just breathing but nevfer exercising other parts of its body? Where is the adult that never does anything to increase the rate of respiration? Do not forget, though, if we were paying for it we would have to add to the above figures for all exercise—and for any illness or any stimulus that would increase the heartbeat, for the ratio of pulsation and breathing is one to four. How much &quot;extracurricular” breathing could we afford; or, for that matter, how long would our salaries let us keep on living? Surely we must thank Jehovah that the air is free! By breathing deeply, expanding the lungs to their greatest capacity, more waste material can be expelled and we will feel more refreshed; and it costs no more to breathe deeply than to take just a shallow breath.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Pollution or Appreciation, Which?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Obviously the more nearly pure the air is the better. But what is happening to this marvelous God-given free air that we breathe? Starting with the basic unit of society, the family group, what do we find? Circles and circles of blue smoke ascending from cigarettes puffed too often by those who have never seriously considered how precious pure air really is, or worse, by those who do not care. It follows from the home into every means of public transportation, over the “coffee break,” into the markets, business houses, back to the home again; and the nonsmoker is the unfortunate victim of circumstances, having his lungs filled with what he does not want—but what can he do? Perhaps no less desirable, but considerably more necessary, is the smoke from home furnaces, dirt from grinding operations, street repairs, construction work, wear of rubber tires, insect sprays, and so forth—all polluting the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nationally, air-contamination problems confront sanitation engineers as huge industrial plants belch out dangerous waste discharges. Smog, so often caused by improper combustion in auto engines and increased by high humidity and certain air currents, has become such a hazard that millions of dollars is spent every year on scientific research to control or abolish it. Air-pollution abatement problems have become national problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yet all these pale into insignificance in this nuclear age when puny man tries to get control of this atmosphere and the space beyond it! While East and West are proposing and disagreeing over nuclear test bans, both sides are detonating bombs that cause the whole earth to be encircled and blanketed with mysterious radioactive particles causing untold damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Will it always be like this? The One who made the air, our earth, and man upon it assures us that it will not, for he has promised ‘to destroy those who destroy the earth? Today there are hundreds of thousands of people, God-fearing individuals in all nations and of all races and religions, who are realizing that all man’s efforts can never equal, to say nothing of duplicating, such a thing as our atmosphere. And as they look into the beautifully curtained, star-studded vault above they experience not only the breath-taking grandeur of the celestial bodies “declaring the glory of God” but also the refreshment that comes with each breath of air, and they are comforted as they go on preparing themselves to stay here to enjoy it forever. They are showing their appreciation by using their breath, their strength, their vital energy in praise of the loving Creator, Jehovah God, who gave us this wonderful gift—air to breathe!—Rev. 11: 18; Ps. 19:1.</span></p>

On each quayside they loop mooring ropes to bollards. Slowly the ship’s electric winches tow her damaged bows, bollard by bollard, to the head of the 520-foot dock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Hydraulic lock gates and sluices close. Down in the pumping station twenty-eight feet below ground the great centrifugal pumps break into a whirring roar. The depth-gauge indicator pointing at twentyseven and a half feet begins to fall as 36,000 gallons of water a minute surges through the outlet overhead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Back on the surface three-men teams sling lines across bows and stem, white plumb bobs marking the dead center of the ninety-two-foot-wide dock. Shouted directions to block and tackle gangs bring the ship’s hull on center. Side clearances are measured, and other teams sling shoring timbers from bulwarks, resting opposite ends on dock sills. Down and down the water level drops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Crews of four, armed with long-handled brushes, man two rafts. Pulling themselves along the ship’s sides by cables slung from stem to stern, they wash the sides of the vessel in readiness for painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Then the water begins falling away from the ship. Her keel now resting on the keel blocks, shoring gangs wedge timbers into place. With the gangway mounted, repair crews go aboard to fit new rivets in engine-room plates. Air compressors, pneumatic drills and electric welding plant are brought into position on the dockside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Soon the closespaced, four-foot-high blocks come into view. One and a half hours after the 495-horsepower electric pumps began turning, the Consuelo stands high and dry, her towering tonnage balanced on the keel blocks by twenty-eight shoring timbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Surveyors and engineers inspect the damage while lofty trestles and rigging are set for painting and for work on the giant phosphor-bronze screw. “Normally on the New York run,” explained a repairman, “she ran into ice up in Montreal.” Every one of , its four mounted blades was damaged. Floodlights for night work are put in place, and pneumatic drill operators swarm over the grain ship’s propeller, gouging and prizing from the propeller boss the concrete protection for the gigantic nuts holding the great blades in position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In adjacent dry dock No. 1 troopship Empire Parkeston has just completed her half-yearly overhaul. Gear removed, the massive sluice blocks are about to lift. Double cataracts bursting through the curving flood tunnels will float the vessel and leave her ready in forty-five minutes to edge through the open lock gates into King George dock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There we must leave the dry docks to see what else is happening at Britain’s 800-year-old third port. Stretching more than seven miles along the north bank of the River Humber, it handles 7,000 vessels, with a net tonnage of more than 5,500,000. Annual traffic exceeds 10,000,000 tons, worth £350,000,000 ($990,500,000),</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Twelve Miles of Quays</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">The port has eleven docks, with a total water area of 200 acres, and twelve miles of quays. It deals with the larger types of ocean freighters serving all the chief ports of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Dock railways, 320 miles of them, cover every part of the installation. Berthed at the south side of King George dock, toward the eastern end of Hull’s dock system, a Scandinavian freighter piled high with pit props is unloading into fifty-truck trains alongside. Of the port’s more than 200 electric and hydraulic cranes with capacities up to forty tons, a battery of eight lines the quayside at this point. In the modern manner, the huge bundles are left in the slings to cut out re-slinging in the timber storage area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Train movement,” engine driver Arthur Harland told me, “is a high-pressure job. Dockers are paid on piece work. The moment they go to dinner we must couple up to those loaded trains and get them away to the mechanical prop yard. By the time the dockers are back, empty trains must be there waiting for loading. The same thing happens at teatime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the fifteen acre, eighteen-track prop yard, rail-traveling diesel-driven cranes unload the trucks, using the attached slings. A limited number of props are taken out of their slings and built up horizontally and crosswise into square columns fifty feet high to form four corners of a vast dump. Into this the cranes drop their bundles, the bundles being locked in position by crosswise timbers. Millions of pit props forming woody-smelling canyons fifty feet high stretch in 300-foot sections, three sets of rails running in the artificial gorges. There the pitwood is left for seasoning.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>High-Speed Coal Handling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Ten coal wagon hoists and four conveyor belts load coal at high speeds. The hoists raise trucks bodily, tip them up and drop the coal down chutes into ships’ holds. The conveyor belts are even faster, handling 800 tons an hour. Quicker than one a minute, loaded trucks rolling down an incline are arrested by grabs. Tipping rams tilt the trucks forty-five degrees. Portions of the rail platform tilt also, leaving gaps through which the coal slides down with little breakage into a hopper feeding a below-surface conveyor. The rubber belt carries the coal to an overhead chute that directs the coal into the ship’s bunker. Each conveyor handles two end-door wagons at once, which, after leveling up, continue down the incline, making way for two more loaded trucks. “Coal and coke was our biggest bulk commodity,” said Mr. Harland as we stood at No. 7 Conveyor. “But we’re handling much less now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Grain imports, however, keep the highly mechanized plant busy. Most of it is concentrated at King George dock. Much of the country’s grain passes through Hull. And one of the port’s chief industries is flour milling and the processing of other grain products.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Pneumatic Grain Handling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Berthed at No. 1 Quay in the northwestern arm of King George dock, a 10,000-ton grain ship is having her cargo literally sucked out of her. Two booms stretch out from a floating elevator dipping their long suckers from a lofty height into the forward hold. Vacuum pumps draw the grain into the elevator at the rate of three tons a minute, automatically weigh it and discharge it down a chute into a lighter moored alongside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A soaring shore-based pneumatic elevator (one of four) raised its booms, swung into position and lowered its swinging trunks into the aft hold. The huge pipes sink their snouts into the golden grain, automatically cutting out if they encounter any obstacle. Two thirty-six-valve vacuum pumps driven by 175-horsepower motors begin sucking the cargo out of the ship at the rate of 120 tons an hour. Discharge motors pump the grain down chutes into manholes in the quay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">High up in the towering installation, fitter John Hewson, quiet-spoken, friendly, whose job it is to keep these panting monsters sucking and belching with maximum greed, showed me the automatic dust extractor. ’‘Taking that dust away in sacks,” said Mr. Hewson, “keeps one man busy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the silo fair-haired and amicable Mr. Chapman, for twenty-two years machinery attendant at the 40,000-ton-capacity silo, showed me what happens to the grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Fast-moving underground conveyors catch the cereal and carry it to elevators in the silo, where it is raised in buckets, automatically weighed and then dropped into four elevators, each handling 480 tons an hour. The elevators raise the grain to the top, or fifth, floor, and drop it on belt conveyors. These convey it to traveling chutes feeding batteries of bins, 288 in all, each twelve feet square by fifty feet deep and holding, roughly, 140 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Hoppers at the lower end of the bins, at ground level, deliver the grain in sacks or in bulk after it has been automatically weighed once more. Sacks are filled with a measured quantity in two seconds. As I watch, some is being loaded by hand at the nearby loading bays into road and rail vehicles; some is carried by conveyor belt to waiting lighters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the same time other storage bins are delivering weighed grain in bulk to conveyor belts running out of the silo and overhead across the quay. From the time grain enters Hull docks until the time it leaves, it is entirely untouched by hand.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Traveling Roof Cranes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Take a quick look at King George dock’s wool-handling arrangements at the northwest arm of the dock, where 40 percent of Britain’s wool imports are dealt with. Lofty portal cranes (cranes mounted on arches like inverted U’s) are unloading cradles of wool from the Panama. Sorted to marks and numbers in the two-story transit sheds mounted with roof cranes and backing the quay, bales are moved to the modern well-lit wool shed. From loading bays running the 800-foot length of the vast shed, rail and road wagons take the wool to the industry’s heart, the West Riding of Yorkshire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Besides wool, perishables pass over the 237,000 square feet of King George dock’s six transit sheds. Normally berthed in this dock, the eighty-ton self-propelled floating crane with a lift of ninety-four feet above the pontoon deck is used in other docks also. Just now it is moored in Alexandra dock, where the port’s one-hundred-ton fixed crane is located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On Alexandra dock’s north quay pipelines connected one of three 15,000-ton-capacity tanks with a molasses ship moored there. Edward Marshall, of The United Molasses Company Limited, told me that pumps, bringing the molasses through the 300-foot-long pipes, transfer 12,000 tons in seventy-two hours. I wondered how the thick, glutinous substance would flow through long pipes. With a slow smile, Marshall explained: “Steam circulating in coils in the ship’s tanks keeps the molasses fluid. We deal with cargoes from the West Indies of up to 12,000 tons here. The molasses we handle goes for cattle food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Near Alexandra dock two electric coal conveyor belts reach out 400 feet into the Humber to River Pier, 1,300 feet long. The water is never less than eighteen feet deep here. Continental fruit and vegetables unload at this pier without the vessels entering dock.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>11,750,000 Project</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">Just opened, Hull’s £1,750,000 new Riverside quay for cargo and passengers replaces the thirty-four-year-old quay destroyed by incendiary bombs in 1941. It provides deep-water berths irrespective of tide, the depth varying from nineteen to forty feet. This and its quick tum-around facilities bring continental ports several hours nearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Moving out on the tide, Arctic Hunter is leaving St. Andrew’s fish dock for Icelandic grounds. The largest trawlers in the world are among the 2,000 fishing vessels that pass this point. For periodic underwater inspection and repair, trawlers are brought to the four slipways located in St. Andrew’s dock extension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A big tanker stands at the No. 1 T-ended jetty at Salt End—eastern extremity of the dock layout. Oil, 4,500,000 gallons of it, gushes from her hold. Pipelines carry it to the 82,000,000-gallon tank-storage clustered half a mile away. Coastal tankers take on bulk shipments by pipeline. Hull’s oil imports last year rose by 12.5 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Three docks reach up into the city-center of Hull, bringing graceful bows to tower majestically beside shop fronts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the dock headquarters, Victoria Square, a British Transport Commission official checked his lists. “At the moment there are 55 freighters and 32 trawlers berthed,” he told me. “That’s about normal. More than 6,000 men are working them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">World-ranging ships. Mammoth machines. Six thousand men. This vast dock installation is itself a huge machine, handling anything from matchsticks to one-hundred-ton castings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY’S “PENTAGON”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I</span><span class="font15">TALY’S Christian Democratic party has at the top what the magazine </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Atlantic </span><span class="font15">described in its September, 1958, issue as “a cozy Tammany-like atmosphere of all-pervasive clientele, favors, short cuts, boondoggles, and shocking preferences that the Italians by now call simply ‘the undergovernment,’ in the sense in which one would mean the underbrush. This undergovernment is being taken over by the Italian 'Pentagon,' the ruling group in the Vatican. ... It is hard to assess the influence of the Italian Pentagon in American terms. Imagine a sovereign power installed squarely in Washington; a power whose influence extended over half the world, whose finances not only reached out on the international plane but also controlled an impressive share of the nation's stock market and real estate; a power which practically monopolized the nation's social assistance with</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">fitTT’AST is East, and JCjWest is West, and never the twain shall meet,” wrote Rudyard Kipling. There are, indeed, great differences between East and West. At first a visitor from the West may think the differences in the way of life here are bothersome, but once he has grown accustomed to them he may feel that some are improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">May I take you on a brief tour of a typical city in Asia? You will see for yourself. I am best acquainted with Bangkok, so let me show you around. This is the capital of old Siam, now known as Thailand, and the largest city in southeast Asia, having a population of a million or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Here is a bookshop. There are many in town. Asiatics love to read. This in itself is a big difference between East and West. Westerners are more inclined to watch television or a motion picture, and I well remember how I disliked reading assignments when I was a high school student in the United States,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I see you have noticed the maps hanging on the wall. Are you having difficulty in finding your country? Most maps printed here center around the continent of Asia. Is it not reasonable that a country should center its maps around its own land?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You have noticed the calendars on sale, have you? Yes, this is 1959 according to the Christian era. However, in Buddhist Asia it is B.E. 2502. That is, this is the year 2502 according to the Buddhist era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As we leave the bookshop you will see ail|i elderly Siamese woman on the side-<sup>1</sup> ijiijlk selling mangoes and sweetened glutinous rice. Notice how she squats, resting her torso on the heels of her feet. Could you do the same? If you could learn to sit in this fashion you could rest your weary bones anytime, anywhere. When this woman was young the mahogany color of her teeth was considered a beauty feature. They are stained by the betel nut she chews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some Westerners ask about</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">the custom of removing shoes when entering a home. Bear in mind that here the floor is chair, table and bed. It is kept clean and polished. To wear your shoes in the house would be equivalent to putting them on the dining room table or on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We have been making our tour but a few minutes, yet it is already evident that this is a man’s world—at least this part of the world is. The woman walks along behind the man, whether the man is a husband, father or brother. This attitude extends into the personal daily life of the Asiatic. Man’s headship is undisputed here. This is a deviation from Western custom, if I ever saw one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Shall we have something to eat? Here is a typical shop. Of course, chopsticks are used instead of knife and fork. Here the “staff of life” is rice. Bread? If you like, we can have some of that for dessert, soaked in pork fat and sprinkled with sugar. Bread is cake here and eaten as a delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You are attracting the attention of everyone in the shop. I think you will be surprised to know why. It is because of your dark hair and skin. The common people in Asia believe that all Westerners have blond hair, pink skin and blue eyes. I am afraid that you are not very acceptable as a Westerner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the West your good tan would be considered to be most wholesome. Here people take care to shade themselves from the sun. This is true not only because it is unbearably hot, but also because light skin is considered a beauty feature here. An Asiatic equivalent to your “he doesn’t have sense enough to come in out of the rain” would be—you guessed it—“not enough sense to come in out of the sun.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If we want to get the shopkeeper’s attention we have to call out “Boy!” or “Brother!” It is no breach of etiquette to call out your order or shout for the shopkeeper if ydu need him. That is true in any restaurant except those that regularly cater to foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Shall we have some pineapple? In southeast Asia they are plentiful. Here is the boy with some sliced in a dish. It isn’t ripe, you say? This is the East, my friend, and fruit is usually eaten when it is still unripe so that it will have a tangy flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How do you think the women here compare with their Western sisters? A bit more opulent, aren’t they? In this region that’is true. In the West women struggle with diets and body-shaping contraptions to keep themselves trim. Here just the opposite is true. The male is the one that tends to his waistline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I think I know the man approaching our table. If he comes to see us he will sit down before saying more than a few words. Why? Because here in the East to speak down to one who is seated is considered an act of disrespect. In the West it would be expected that we stand to be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There are many things far more important than these differences between East and West. For example, we have all descended from one common ancestor, Noah, who survived the great flood. You will be interested to know that in Sanskrit the word for mankind is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ma~not<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font16"> derived from the word </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">manu.</span><span class="font16"> Manu is a character of legendary history well known to the Hindu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In McFarland’s Thai-English dictionary, printed by Stanford University Press, under the word “Manu&quot; is the following very interesting explanation, which quotes from an account found in the Satapatha Brah-mana: One morning Manu caught a small fish in the water that had been brought to him for washing his hands. The fish immediately pleaded for protection until it should be grown, promising in return salvation from a great flood that was to destroy mankind. Manu kept the fish, which grew rapidly until nothing except the ocean was large enough to contain it; then he let it go. At that time the fish foretold the time of the coming flood and instructed Manu to make a big boat in which to save his life. Manu did as directed, and when the flood did come the fish returned. Manu fastened the cable of his ship to the fish’s horn, thus passing over the northern mountain (the Himalayas, as a commentator explains), where he was instructed to fasten his ship to a tree until the waters should subside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We know that “Noah” in Hebrew means “rest; consolation.” In Sanskrit the name “Manu” bears the same meaning. Used in many compound words, it implies comfort, encouragement or consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Boy! Boy!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Shall we have something to drink before leaving? What will it be? Why, tea, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I am afraid our time is up. We will have to be on our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">No, no tipping here. This is not Europe, my friend. This is Thailand.</span></p><img src="g_E_19591122_files/g_E_19591122-13.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:120pt;">
<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font16">IE message about God’s kingdom that Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to the people is the best of good news. By this evangel they are fulfilling their prophetic commission to ‘bind up the brokenhearted and comfort all that mourn,’ even as stated at Isaiah 61:1, 2. However, that prophetic command also includes the proclaiming of “the day of vengeance on the part of our God.” This they are doing by warning all people regarding “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” Armageddon. —Rev. 16:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because they are also true to this part of their commission some take offense, such as a certain Canadian Jesuit priest who recently published and is circulating a card entitled “An Answer to Yankee Stadium.” Addressing it to the Witnesses, he claims to admire their zeal and to grant that they are sincere, but insists that they are sadly mistaken regarding their God Jehovah. The God they preach, he contends, is cruel and unreasonable; no God of love would destroy nearly all his children in a horrible Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What about this argument of his noted above? Does it carry any weight in the light of reason and the Scriptures? Let us see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the first place, as for Jehovah God destroying so many of his children, let it be noted that God does not consider all humankind his children. When the nation of Israel, which at one time truly did consist of his children, became unfaithful, God refused to recognize them further as his children, and he inspired his prophet Moses to say: “They have acted ruinously on their own part; they are not his children, the defect is their own.”—Deut. 32:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nor may we overlook that Jesus spoke of the religious leaders of his day, not as children of God but as ‘of their father the Devil, whose desires they wished to do,’ Jesus also likened the vast majority of mankind to goats, whose destiny is destruction. He showed that the sheeplike ones that will inherit eternal life are comparatively few.—Matt. 7:13, 14; 25:31-46; John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As for God being unreasonable and cruel to destroy so many of mankind, let it be noted that God has four basic qualities or attributes, namely, power, wisdom, justice and love, and these are perfectly balanced with one another. Jehovah God is not a sentimentalist. In his omniscience, he, as the Life-giver, has determined the conditions upon which his intelligent creatures can be an honor to him and a blessing to themselves as well as to their fellows. When any of his intelligent creatures fail to meet those conditions they fail to serve God’s purpose for their existence and so he cannot let them continue to live on indefinitely.—Ezek. 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Such is not only a reasonable conclusion but also a Scriptural one, as we read: “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.” True, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that”—all mankind may live? No, but “in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” Because “the wages sin pays is death,” therefore God calls out: “Search for Jehovah, you people, while he may be found. Call to him while he proves to be near^ Let the wicked man leave his way, and the harmful man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”—Ps. 145:20; John 3:16; Rom. 6:23; Isa. 55:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Today, especially in so-called Christendom, we find the conditions foretold at 2 Timothy 3:1-5: &quot;But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, selfassuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, without gratitude, with no loving-kindness, having no natural affection, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because of this wicked condition God is having his witnesses call out: &quot;Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues. For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.” True, not all persons may be alike wicked, but if they remain in this wicked old system of things they will go down with it. Regardless of how moral any of the antediluvians may have been, unless they got into the ark with Noah they perished.—Rev. 18:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As for Armageddon as being &quot;horrible” —it will be, but not needlessly or unjustly so. It might be said that pulling out a diseased tooth or cutting out a brain tumor or a breast cancer is a horrible deed, but one and all such horrible procedures are necessary to the welfare of the patient and are really the lesser of two evils. So also will Armageddon be, as it were, a horrible surgical operation. However, it is absolutely necessary for the vindication of God’s name and the welfare of all lovers of righteousness that all the godless and wicked be destroyed. Or to use another illustration: A strong and honest city government is obligated to get rid of its criminal elements even though this may cause suffering to the wives and children of the criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The thing to do is to get God’s perspective of matters, that of the surgeon performing the operation or of the city government interested in a decent city, rather than be swayed by sentimentality. To such men as the Canadian Jesuit who find fault with God’s judgments, he says: “For the thoughts of you people are not my thoughts, nor are my ways your ways . . . For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.”—Isa. 55:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Did not Jesus prophesy that as it was in the days of Noah it would be down at the end of this world or system of things? And did not that Deluge wipe out all save Noah and his family? Think how horrible that must have been! What panic must have gripped earth’s inhabitants as the rain kept on falling, ten, twenty, thirty, forty days, and the waters rose higher and higher and higher, until they at last covered the highest mountain peaks. And what about the fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah? Or the annihilation of Pharaoh’s host in the Red Sea? Horrible all these destructions? Without a doubt, but also just, wise and loving, for they meant both the vindication of Jehovah’s supremacy and the deliverance of the righteous who had been suffering at the hands of the wicked.—Ex. 14:26-28; Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So regardless of what a Canadian Jesuit priest may say, reason and the Scriptures unite to show that Armageddon’s destruction of the wicked is consistent with Jehovah’s attributes of wisdom, justice and love.</span></p>

The satellite passed the moon at a distance of 4,375 miles from its surface on October 6, then traveled out beyond the moon to about 292,000 miles from the earth on' October 10, Whether the satellite photographed the surface of the moon never seen from the earth was unknown, as Soviet scientists were not forthcoming with reports on data gathered by means of the vehicle. Lunik III, as the satellite is called, would reportedly complete a circuit of its large orbit twice a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Khrushchev in Peiping</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Soviet Premier Nikita S, Khrushchev arrived in Peiping on September 30 just in time for the celebration of the Communist Chinese regime’s tenth anniversary. Ten thousand guests from other lands, among them top Communists from 87 nations, were also on hand. Upon his arrival, Khrushchev called his recent talks with U.S, President Eisenhower “valuable,” &quot;We, on our part,” he said, “must do everything possible to preclude war as a means for settling outstanding questions.” “Even so noble and progressive a system as socialism cannot be imposed by force of arms against the will of the people,” Khni-shchev further declared. The Russian leader departed for Moscow on October 4, following a series of talks with Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the Chinese Communist party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">British Elections</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Britain’s Conservative party headed by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan won 49.4 percent of the 28,000,000 votes cast in the general elections there on October 8. The Conservatives got 365 of the 630 seats in the House of Commons, to compare with the Labor party's 258. On October 14 Macmillan named a new cabinet geared to spur scientific advancement. The 65-year-old prime minister and the Conservatives will thus have overwhelming control of the House of Commons, and a position at the helm of British politics, for another four years. Regarding his party's victory, Macmillan remarked, “It has gone off rather well.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">, The 1959 Nobel Prize in medicine, amounting to about $42,000, will be shared by Dr. Arthur Kornberg of Stanford University and Dr. Severe Ochoa of New York University. On October 15 the two U.S. biochemists were honored for their discoveries of enzymes for artificially producing nucleic acids, found in living cells. One of these substances, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), carries hereditary qualities from generation to generation. The other, RNA (ribonucleic acid), while thought to pass on hereditary instructions in the case of some viruses, is also involved in the production of protein, the basic material of the living cell. Working separately, Drs, Ochoa and Kornberg have dis covered enzymes capable ol promoting the production of RNA and DNA respectively from smaller organic molecules. Now it will be possible to study these vital chemicals in isolation. The Caroline Institute, which makes the annual awards under provisions of the will of Alfred B. Nobel, said that the scientists had “clarified many of the problems of regeneration and continuity of life.” They had not, of course, answered the question, “What is the origin of life?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S.-Philippine Accord</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; On October 12 a memorandum of agreement was signed between the Philippine Republic’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Manila. Though details are yet to be worked out, substantial agreement was reported on the matter of legal jurisdiction over U.S. military personnel stationed in the Philippines. Under the terms of the accord the U.S. will retain four military bases and a few minor installations in the island republic. Certain matters pertaining to the use of the bases and the types of armaments used there will be subject to discussion and agreement, as is the possible renewal of the twenty-five-year term of the holdings. Under provisions of the 1947 accord with the Philippines the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">had held twenty-three bases and installations there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Rhinoceros Gets Landslide Vote</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In what was described by one sociologist as &quot;a severe criticism of the regime,” a female rhinoceros named Caca-reco won an overwhelming vote in municipal elections in Sfio Paulo, Brazil, on September 7. She even did well in the industrial city of Campinas and the port of Santos. It was said that Cacareco received at least 50,000 votes in the Sfio Paulo election and that a final all-inclusive tally might bring her 100,000. Shortages of food staples, high living costs and general displeasure over Brazilian politics were said to be factors underlying the rhinoceros vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Hunger and Poverty</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Over one billion people in 100 nations and territories associated with the U.N. are waging a fight against &quot;continued acceptance of poverty, illiteracy and chronic i H health.” This was pointed up by Paul G. Hoffman, managing director of the United Nations Special Fund, in an address to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations General Assembly on October 5. Hoffman appealed for an increase in contributions to the fund to further its program of technical assistance for underdeveloped countries. Annual per capita income in the substandard lands would be only $125 to $130 this year, to compare with $110 in 1950, Whereas this is a gain of $15 to $20 for these countries, nations of Western Europe and North America have experienced an average gain of $300 in per capita income over the same period. With a Special Fund goal of $100,000,000 set for this year, Hoffman hoped for a time when &quot;hunger, illiteracy and chronic ill health everywhere can be the memories of the past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Assassination Attempts</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;§&gt; On October 7 Iraqi Premier </span><span class="font15">Abdul Karim Kassfrn was the victim of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">an attempted assas</span><span class="font15">sination. Fired upon as he rode in his auto down Baghdad’s busy Rashid Street, the 45-year-old state head suffered a flesh wound and a fractured shoulder, but his condition was not serious. The attempt followed a series of riots in the capital protesting the execution of seventeen military men and civilians charged with plotting against Kassim’s regime. A second plot to kill Kassim was revealed on October 15, but details of the attempt were not then furnished by the Baghdad government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">De Gaulle Upheld on Algeria </span><span class="font15">•§&gt; On October 16 the French National Assembly voted in favor of President Charles de Gaulle's new plan for Algerian self-determination. The count was 441 to 23. Just a month earlier De Gaulle had offered Algerians the chance to determine their own political future by referendum within four years of the attainment of peace in Algeria. They would be able to choose between independence, autonomy with ties to France, or integration into the French Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A War-Free Antarctic</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;§&gt; Representatives of the twelve nations active in Antarctica opened a parley in Washington on October 15. Among the participants were the Soviet Union and the chief Western nations. All reportedly agreed that the White Continent should remain demilitarized and that it should be open to scientific study by any country. A treaty incorporating these points was expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Wave of Terrorism</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Acts of terrorism swept through Venezuela in early October. By October 13 over 100 persons had been arrested </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">by the Caracas government. They were suspected of com</span><span class="font15">plicity in a plot to overthrow Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt. Terrorists set off explosions in such places as clubs, movie houses and radio stations, seemingly for the purpose of creating the impression that the administration was incapable of maintaining order throughout the land. Among those arrested were a number of lawyers and writers thought to be the &quot;intellectual authors” of the wave of terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Haitian Senators Ousted</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;§■ On October 9 Haitian President Francois Duvalier issued a decree dismissing six of Haiti’s twenty-six senators. It was maintained that the six ousted senators had abandoned their responsibilities and that the National Assembly would therefore choose men to replace them. Five of the dismissed senators are living in exile. All six were charged with plotting against the Duvalier government and were accused of involvement in preparations for an invasion of the island by foreign mercenaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Synagogue in Madrid</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In 1492, yielding to the pressure of the Spanish Inquisition, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella issued an edict expelling Jews from Spain. In early October, on Rosh Ha-shana, the Jewish New Year, a new synagogue was dedicated in Madrid. It was the.,first Jewish synagogue dedicated since the royal order of nearly five centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Typhoon Wreaks Havoc</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">'$&gt; Over 5,000 persons were reported missing or dead as a result of Typhoon Vera, which struck Japan on September 26 and 27. It was said that more than 10,000 persons had been injured and a million and a half were rendered homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The port dty of Nagoya was among the hardest hit. This </span><span class="font15">industrial center was termed </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">&quot;sea of dead.&quot; Property damage in this, the most damaging storm in Japan’s history, reportedly ran into tens of millions of dollars, at least 5750,000,000, according to early estimates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Soviet Consumer Credit Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">•$&gt; On October 1 many Soviet shoppers had their first experience with installment buying. Throughout the Russian Republic, which covers over half of the Soviet Union, customers could purchase such items as wrist watches, bicycles, radios, cameras, accordions and clocks for a down payment of from 20 to 25 percent. Service charges of one or two percent would have to be borne by the buyer and payments would </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">be made through payroll deductions over a period of six </span><span class="font15">months to a year. Missing from the credit lists were such things as television sets, refrigerators and automobiles, for which the demand is considerable but the supply small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Congo Violence</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Violence flared up In the Belgian Congo on October 13. Lulua and Baluba tribesmen clashed in the central Congo province of Kasai. A week earlier, police broke up a fight between them at a soccer match. Later, Lulua raiding parties attacked Baluba villages. On the night of October 13, at Matadi, a Congo River port 100 miles southwest of Leopoldville, about 2,000 members of the African Ngouziste sect gathered in the native quarter, defying a curfew. Reportedly in “religious hyste</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">ria,&quot; about 1,000 sect members battled with police. Before </span><span class="font15">they were dispelled 35 Europeans and Africans had been injured. Matadi- was placed under martial law on October 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;Red Tide”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">From time to time </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">waters </span><span class="font15">in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Gulf of Mexico are </span><span class="font15">darkened by the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">notorious </span><span class="font15">“red tide.” The reddish </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">hue re</span><span class="font15">sults from rapid </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">and great </span><span class="font15">multiplication of tiny </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">organ</span><span class="font15">isms called dinoflagellates.

<p><span class="font16">HE PREACHING that is productive bears permanent fruit. It has the preserving quality of Jesus’ early disciples, whom he called &quot;the salt of the earth.” Words of such preaching, &quot;seasoned with salt,” come only from God. Jesus said: &quot;Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore', beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” Is this prayer being answered? Is this small band of workers producing fruit to God’s praise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You will thrill to the report of the Christian ministry performed by Jehovah’s witnesses this year. Throughout the world the preserving message of God’s kingdom that they preach has produced thousands of new workers for the harvest. Their experiences, their joys, their detailed activity, are all available in this year’s report for only 3/6 (for Australia, 4/-).

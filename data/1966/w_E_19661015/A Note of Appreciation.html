<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a letter to the Watch Tower Society signed by both her daughter and granddaughter, one of Jehovah’s witnesses in England writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Do you remember how Jehovah reproached Israel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:24-23:43:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 43:24</a>) and said that His people had brought Him no ‘sweet cane’? That seems such a small thing for the God of all the earth to mention, but how understandable. Everything is his, for he made all good things. He originated the aromatic ‘sweet cane’ and all other delightful things of the earth, yet it grieved him that the Israelites had not wanted to share with him the good things he had given them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When my children were little, how warm it made my heart when they broke off a piece of the chocolate I had bought them and popped it into my mouth. The loving response to love, how valuable it is! And that brings us to the point of why we are writing to you. We wish to send the ‘sweet cane’ of our thanks to all the dear brothers and sisters who help in doing Jehovah’s work, especially in preparing our dearly loved <em>Watchtower. </em>We indeed feel a part of a big and devoted family. So please accept our loving thanks and thoughts.”</p>

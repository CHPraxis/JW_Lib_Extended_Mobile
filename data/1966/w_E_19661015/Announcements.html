<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many centuries ago Jehovah God foretold a world government that would bring endless peace to mankind, a heavenly government that would be ruled by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 9:7</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses believe that divine promise, and they publicize that heavenly government. During October they will do this by offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three booklets, for $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>PROTECTION FROM MORAL BREAKDOWN</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Never before in history have so many words been spoken or written that are not worth hearing or reading. Not so, however, with <em>Awake! </em>magazine. It considers timely world issues as well as scientific, social and economic problems, yet the words it contains are well worth reading. They are upbuilding, strengthening and comforting. That is because <em>Awake! </em>upholds Scriptural principles of honesty, truthfulness, justice, moral cleanness and love for all mankind without racial or national distinction. Its words provide real protection from the world’s cultural breakdown. Read it regularly. Send for a year’s subscription and receive free three timely booklets on Bible subjects. Only $1.</p>

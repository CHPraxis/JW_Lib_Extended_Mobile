WHY SUCH A WICKED WORLD?
Have you ever wondered why God, who is All-powerful, would allow wickedness to continue so long? Have you ever asked yourself if it will ever end? Is the rapid increase in crime and delinquency cause for pessimism or is there hope of relief in sight for our generation? These questions and many others are answered in the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”; 416 pages, hardbound, gold-embossed cover; 50c. Send at once and receive the free booklet When God Is King over All the Earth.
FIELD MINISTRY
It is important for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses to keep in mind the Scriptural counsel not to “neglect the house of our God.” And it is a great kindness to others to encourage them to attend the meetings of the congregation too. At their weekly Bible studies held in relatively small groups in various neighborhoods throughout their congregation territory, Jehovah’s witnesses are at present studying the fine book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” With a view to sharing this vital information with others, during July they will offer that book, with a booklet, to other interested persons on a contribution of 50c.

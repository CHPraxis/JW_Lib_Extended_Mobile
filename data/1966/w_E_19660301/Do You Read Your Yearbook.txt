Do You Read Your Yearbook?
For many years the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been published only in the English language, but it is now available in German and Spanish. One Witness in Florida writes, in appreciation for the Spanish Yearbook: “I have felt something special in having the privilege of reading it in my own language. As I read in Spanish the experiences of far-off countries, I have felt a sensation of unity with the brothers in those places. I consider the Yearbook to be one of the most marvelous provisions that God’s organization has provided. I have spoken with several brothers and they have all expressed to me the same thing; namely, the happiness, edification and knowledge that they have received in what they have read up to now. The Yearbook in Spanish is for all the Spanish-speaking brothers throughout the world one of the most effective ways that Jehovah has used to keep us up-to-date with the progress of his visible organization.” Are you reading your Yearbook?

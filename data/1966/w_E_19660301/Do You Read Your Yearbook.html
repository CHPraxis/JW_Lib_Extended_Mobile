<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For many years the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>has been published only in the English language, but it is now available in German and Spanish. One Witness in Florida writes, in appreciation for the Spanish <em>Yearbook: </em>“I have felt something special in having the privilege of reading it in my own language. As I read in Spanish the experiences of far-off countries, I have felt a sensation of unity with the brothers in those places. I consider the <em>Yearbook </em>to be one of the most marvelous provisions that God’s organization has provided. I have spoken with several brothers and they have all expressed to me the same thing; namely, the happiness, edification and knowledge that they have received in what they have read up to now. The <em>Yearbook </em>in Spanish is for all the Spanish-speaking brothers throughout the world one of the most effective ways that Jehovah has used to keep us up-to-date with the progress of his visible organization.” Are you reading your <em>Yearbook?</em></p>

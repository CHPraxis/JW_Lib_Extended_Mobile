FIELD MINISTRY
As willing and devoted slaves of Christ who appreciate that they were “bought with a price,” Jehovah’s witnesses will hold fast to the service of their heavenly Master during March by sharing in the ministry. (1 Cor. 7:23) As they do so they will offer to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.
LORD’S EVENING MEAL
On Tuesday, April 5, after 6 p.m., Standard Time, the Lord’s Evening Meal will be commemorated by all congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses along with other interested persons. Each congregation should make advance arrangements for this occasion, notifying interested persons in its territory of the exact time and place of the meeting. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers, if available and capable, should be assigned to deliver the discourse.
SEEING IS NOT ALWAYS BELIEVING
There is so much to look at through modern mass media of instruction and entertainment. But can you accept at face value everything you see? When it comes to matters affecting your life you want to be sure. You can be with The Watchtower and Awake! These magazines give sound reasons and Bible proof. Enjoy them regularly. Both for one year, only $2. Send today.

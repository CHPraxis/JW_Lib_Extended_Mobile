<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">According to Dr. J. A. Schindler’s book <em>How to Live 365 Days a Year, </em>“The heart rate goes up markedly during anger, often to 180 or 220, or higher, and stays there until the anger has passed. The blood pressure rises markedly and steeply from a normal of 130 or so to 230 or more. This is a manifestation that often produces dire results.” Clearly, those who heed the Bible’s counsel to “let anger alone and leave rage” and to cultivate the fruits of the spirit are wise.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:22, 23</a>.</p>

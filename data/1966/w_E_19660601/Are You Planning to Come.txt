Are You Planning to Come?
WE TRUST that you are diligently making plans to attend one of “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies this summer, and we would like to impress upon you the importance of arriving at the convention location of your choice by the first day of the assembly. Why? Because right from the opening day there will be delightful portions of the program that no one will want to miss. For example, there will be vivid portrayals of Bible accounts that are filled with meaning for us all in this day. These will thrill you with their graphic and accurate presentation of vital lessons.
In addition, outstanding Bible discourses will be heard, effectively spread throughout the days of the assembly. You will want to hear them all, for each one will play a vital part in thoroughly equipping you for life and service in the days that lie just ahead. Consider some of these fascinating topics that will be presented on the program: “Building on a Right Foundation with Fire-Resistant Materials,” “Making Grateful Use of a Penny,” “Liberty-giving Worship and Freedom of Worship,” and “Preach a Release to the Captives.” Then, too, there will be the widely advertised public talk, “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?” Be sure to come early and reap the benefit of each day’s full and informative program.

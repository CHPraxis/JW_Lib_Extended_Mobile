FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God is the Provider of a banquet for all peoples. Already men of all nations are feasting on the satisfying spiritual provisions he has made, and it is the privilege of those who do so to invite others to join them. This Jehovah’s witnesses will do during June by offering to others the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” and two booklets, for $1.50.

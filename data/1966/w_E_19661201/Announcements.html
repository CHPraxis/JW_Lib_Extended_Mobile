<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses know that the things that God says in his Word are true, and by their ministry they endeavor to aid others to have that same conviction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:4-45:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 3:4</a>) For that reason, during December they will be calling at the homes of persons everywhere to talk to them about the Bible, and, to aid in a study of God’s Word, they will offer them the modern-English <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>and the 416-page book <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, </em>with two booklets, for only $1.50.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ARE YOUR HOPES HIGH?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Life is man’s dearest possession. But life in good health and in peace is almost too much for most persons to hope for. Yet the Bible’s promise is endless life under perfect conditions for those who seek to know God’s will and do it. What God expects of us in these modern times and how we can fit our lives into the pattern of this world’s complex and conflicting demands without violating Scriptural principles are satisfyingly considered in the book <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </em>Read it with great profit by comparing it with the Bible. Send for a copy, along with the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>a modern-language edition of the complete Bible. Both together for only $1.50.</p>

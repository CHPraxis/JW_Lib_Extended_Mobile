It Dwells in the Palace of a King
● At Proverbs 30:28, the “gecko lizard” is listed as one of the four small things that are instinctively wise, this lizard being able to take hold “with its own hands” and make its way even into a king’s palace, where it can take hold of any surface by means of its “hands”—its adhesive-padded feet. The adhesive disks, says Raymond Ditmars, “are strikingly like the magnified pads on the foot of a fly; and their method of adhesion is the same—not aided by a sticky secretion, but through actual suction produced by close-set, concave areas.”

FIELD MINISTRY
Outstanding love for one another identified first-century Christians, and it is still an unmistakable trait of the Christian witnesses of Jehovah in the twentieth century. (John 13:34, 35) Yet their love is not limited to fellow believers; it reaches out to others, moving them to call at the homes of people everywhere to acquaint them with God’s glorious provision of his kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. As they share in this work during the month of May they will be offering to interested persons a handsomely bound Bible-study aid, along with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
WHAT HOPE IN RELIGION?
In spite of ecumenical conferences and religiously inspired movements toward racial integration, the world situation continues to grow more tense. Brotherhood of nations has long been forgotten and even brotherhood within national boundaries is rapidly disappearing. Why have the world religions failed to bring unity and peaceful cooperation, even among those professing the same faith? Can we conclude that religion has failed? The book What Has Religion Done for Mankind? will give you answers that will strengthen your faith as it reveals the pitfalls facing those who look to religion as their hope for the future. Send for your copy today and receive a free booklet. Postpaid, 50c.

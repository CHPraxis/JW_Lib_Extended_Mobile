<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● When Jesus Christ said, “Happy are those who mourn” (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:4-40:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 5:4</strong></a><strong>), did he mean just any mourners at all?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No. Mourners who are happy are those mourning because of inherited sinfulness, or due to unrighteous conditions. The good news that God’s Son takes away the sin of the world and that God’s kingdom will remove wickedness and causes of mourning makes them happy.—Pp. 259, 260.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Protestantism retained the basic doctrines of the Catholic church, in organizational structure it maintained the clergy-laity division and its method of preaching does not follow the general-priesthood principle of the early Christians.—Pp. 308, 309.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● The number of the symbolic “wild beast,” which is 666 according to </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:18-66:13:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 13:18</strong></a><strong>, emphasizes what?</strong></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have we seen an increase in “pestilences” and “food shortages” since 1914, as Jesus Christ foretold as part of the visible “sign” of his second presence? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) Yes, we have. The “Spanish influenza,” termed “one of the most devastating plagues of all time,” took 20 million lives and, for a few short months, put 200 million in bed. Cancer and degenerative diseases continue to increase. As for food shortages, the Director General of the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization recently said that “up to half of the world’s population, 1,500 millions, suffer from hunger or malnutrition or both.”</p>

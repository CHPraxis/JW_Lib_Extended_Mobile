A Little Leaven
Illustrating the apostle Paul’s words about the power of “a little leaven” to ferment the whole lump, is the way of preparing bread in villages of Cyprus. From time immemorial the method has been to mix the flour with water and then to knead it well. When the kneading is considered satisfactory, a piece of leaven is added. There are several kinds of leaven, but the one mostly used comes from old dough. Usually, when kneading is over, a piece of dough is put aside in a warm place. This small piece, after thirty-six to forty-eight hours, is ready leaven and can be used to ferment the whole lump.—1 Cor. 5:6.

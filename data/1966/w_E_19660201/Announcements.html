<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Witnesses of Jehovah God have great joy because of their relationship to him and to his anointed king, Jesus Christ. Unselfishly they endeavor to aid others to share that joy, and they do this by taking to them the faith-inspiring message of the Bible. During February, as they share in this Christian work, they will offer to all persons the outstanding aid to Bible study, <em>The Watchtower, </em>with three booklets, on a $1 contribution.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>MATURITY THAT ALL CAN HAVE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Immaturity can be expected in children, but in adults we look for full-grown stature and stability. Just so, spiritual maturity is the mark of one who has left elementary Bible doctrine or the “milk of the word” and who has progressed to the stature of one capable of eating “solid food.” Such nourishing and faith-building spiritual food is to be found regularly in <em>The Watchtower. </em>Here, Bible truth is presented in understandable and stimulating form. Grow to spiritual maturity. Read <em>The Watchtower </em>each issue, semimonthly. Send today and receive three booklets free. One year, $1.</p>

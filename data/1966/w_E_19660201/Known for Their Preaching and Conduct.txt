Known for Their Preaching and Conduct
◆ A circuit supervisor of Jehovah’s witnesses in Kansas reported this experience: “I called on a group of college students from various countries, prominent professional men who had come here for further education. Two men were from Liberia. They listened to what I said about the Bible and accepted The Watchtower and Awake! Both said they were acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses in Liberia, one of them adding that he even had a cousin who is a Witness there. He explained that he was very much impressed by the change in conduct of those who become Witnesses. One young man, he said, worked for him and used to beg him constantly for money, liquor and cigarettes, and his conduct with women was questionable. After becoming a Witness, all of that activity ceased. When this man teasingly offered the new Witness cigarettes and liquor, he politely declined. Neither does he ask for money anymore. ‘I like that very much about your religion because now he is a very good man,’ the Liberian told me. Both men agreed they would like to have more missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses to educate their people about the Bible and its principles. They were also impressed, by the fact that though they were in the United States half a year, no other persons had called at their door to talk to them except Jehovah’s witnesses.”

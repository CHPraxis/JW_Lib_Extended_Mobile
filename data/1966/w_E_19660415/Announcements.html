<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How many people are there in the world who, if there is a choice, are willing to die rather than compromise on what they believe? Not many. But those who have firm faith In God’s promise of a resurrection are thus strengthened to faithfulness. Jehovah’s witnesses have such faith, and during April they will continue to call at the homes of people everywhere endeavoring to aid others to gain faith in God and his Word. As an aid in this work, they will be offering a year’s subscription for this magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>along with three Scriptural booklets, for $1.</p>

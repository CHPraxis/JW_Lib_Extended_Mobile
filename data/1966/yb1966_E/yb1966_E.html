<h1><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark96"></a>1966 YEARBOOK</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar at Rome God’s declaration came to John, the son of Zechariah the priest. He came into the country around the Jordan River, “preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” (Luke 3:3) John the Baptist was telling his hearers what was written in the book of Isaiah (40:3), and he said: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, you people, make his roads straight.’ ” (Luke 3:4) It was because something marvelous was to happen! John was saying: “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (Matt. 3:2) What news that was for the Jewish people! They were to prepare for the coming of their king. Hence, symbolically speaking, “every gully must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled down, and the curves must become straight ways and the rough places smooth ways; and all flesh will see the saving means of God.”—Luke 3:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throngs of people came out into the wilderness from “Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan” to see this prophet with “clothing of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins.” Moreover, his food “was insect locusts and wild honey.” But what a message John was speaking! On hearing it many of his hearers took immediate action. “People were baptized by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.” (Matt. 3:4-6) The crowds were excited and in real expectation. As they heard John speak and observed his sincerity they wondered about John himself. They thought, “May he perhaps be the Christ?” (Luke 3:15) John gave the answer: “I, for my part, baptize you with water; but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not fit to untie. He will baptize you people with holy spirit and fire.” (Luke 3:16) John referred to Jesus the Son of God, who was shortly to come to him for baptism in water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When John the Baptist made this prophecy of the Jews’ being baptized with holy spirit and fire the Messiah or Christ had not yet appeared. But in due time he did appear. “When all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized and, as he was praying, the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: ‘You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.’ ” (Luke 3:21, 22) Jesus was now about thirty years of age. The people who were acquainted with Jesus were of the opinion that he was the son of Joseph. However, Jesus was the Son of God! It was just as the voice out of heaven said. Thirty-one years previously an angel had said to his virgin mother: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.” —Luke 1:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JESUS BRINGS GLORY TO GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus came up out of the Jordan River, having been fully immersed under its waters by John the Baptist, he was full of holy spirit. The spirit of God led him off into the wilderness, where he stayed for forty days. Then the Devil tried very strenuously to turn Jesus, the Son of God, away from his Father in heaven by means of three temptations. One temptation was that Jesus, being a son of God, should be able to turn a stone into a loaf of bread, and so break his forty-day fast. However, Jesus wisely answered: “Man must not live by bread alone.” The Devil then tried something else. He showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time and said to Jesus: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours. In reply Jesus said to him: ‘It is written, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” ’ ” The Devil failed the second time in his effort to turn Jesus against his Father. Then, after Jesus came to be upon the battlement of the temple in Jerusalem, the Devil said to Jesus: “If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down from here. . . . Jesus said to him: ‘It is said, “You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.” ’ ” —-Luke 4:1-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PUBLIC MINISTRY OF JESUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After these three temptations by the Devil, Jesus returned victorious to the country of Galilee. There in Galilee he began to teach in the synagogues and was held in honor by all. In course of time Jesus traveled to the city of Nazareth. “He came to Nazareth, where he had been reared; and, according to his custom on the sabbath day, he entered into the synagogue, and he stood up to read.” (Luke 4:16) Not only according to Luke but also according to Matthew, Mark and John it was Jesus’ custom to visit synagogues in the various cities in Palestine all his life. As a child with his parents and as a carpenter in Nazareth and after his baptism in the Jordan River, he was never lax in assembling with the Jews on the sabbath in the synagogue or at the temple in Jerusalem. Here was the place for him to come to worship Jehovah and hear what was written in God’s Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On a particular sabbath day, about which Luke tells us, Jesus was in the synagogue at Nazareth. The attendant handed him the scroll of Isaiah, and Jesus opened the scroll to what our Bible lists as chapter sixty-one and then read: “ ‘Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.’ With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed upon him. Then he started to say to them: ‘Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.’ ” (Luke 4:18-21) When Jesus said this, how the eyes of those within his hearing must have opened in amazement! All hearing these words of the prophet Isaiah believed that sometime these truths would be fulfilled. But surely not in this man! Why, this Jesus lived in Nazareth till thirty years of age and most of those in the synagogue were acquainted with him. Now they heard him say: “Today this scripture ... is fulfilled.” That must have made them think. Here was a man who would bear watching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still, “they all began to give favorable witness about him and to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth, and they were saying: ‘This is a son of Joseph, is it not?’ ” (Luke 4:22) The Jews of Nazareth here in the synagogue should have known that Jesus was an unusual man because, not far away, about seven miles north, in Cana of Galilee, he had performed his first miracle. Jesus had been invited to a marriage feast. The wine provided for the occasion ran out, and Jesus said to the men: “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled six water jars to the brim. “And he said to them: ‘Draw some out now and take it to the director of the feast.’ . . . When, now, the director of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine but did not know what its source was . . . the director of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him: ‘Every other man puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have reserved the fine wine until now.’ Jesus performed this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him.”—John 2:7-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those in the synagogue of Nazareth must have known, too, that when Jesus went to Jerusalem to celebrate the preceding Passover he drove the traders from the temple. “He drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he said to those selling the doves: ‘Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise!’ ” (John 2:15-17) They must have heard that exciting news about the money changers because the “Galileans . . . had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival.” (John 4:45) Then, too, they must have heard that Jesus was talking about the kingdom of the heavens as drawing near. (Matt. 4:17; Mark 1:14, 15) And very likely they heard of the second miracle that Jesus performed at Cana, the healing of a boy in Capernaum when a certain attendant of the king had spoken to Jesus in Cana. At the very hour that Jesus said, “Your son lives,” to the father in Cana the boy in Capernaum became well again. Because of this miracle the attendant “and his whole household believed.” (John 4:46-54) News of this kind would spread fast, also to Nazareth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very likely on this sabbath day in the synagogue in Nazareth all these happenings were being mulled over in their minds while Jesus was speaking, and then they heard Jesus say: “No doubt you will apply this illustration to me, ‘Physician, cure yourself; the things we heard as having happened in Capernaum do also here in your home territory.’ ” (Luke 4:23) But Jesus told them: “Truly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory.” (Luke 4:24) After Jesus referred to the things that happened in the days of Elijah and Elisha “those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger; and they rose up and hurried him outside the city, and they led him to the brow of the mountain upon which their city had been built, in order to throw him down headlong. But he went through the midst of them and continued on his way.” (Luke 4:28-30) Even though the Jews of Nazareth tried to kill Jesus this time, he did return to Nazareth; and about a year later, according to his custom, on the sabbath he went to the synagogue. Matthew writes: “After coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: ‘Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works?’ . . . But Jesus said to them: ‘A prophet is not unhonored except in his home territory and in his own house.’ And he did not do many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.” (Matt. 13:54-58) Please note this, that, in spite of the previous attempt to kill him, Jesus went back to the synagogue at Nazareth, “according to his custom,” thus practicing what he preached, ‘Love your enemies.’—Matt. 5:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The weekly assembly place for the worshipers of God in Jesus’ day was the synagogue and that was where you would find Jesus on the sabbath, teaching. When he was in Jerusalem he would go to the temple and teach. Jesus spoke to great crowds, and his disciples were with him to learn. He was not hesitant in telling the truth to the Jewish religious leaders of his day either, and he proved them to be hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, Jesus preached in many places besides the synagogues. He taught multitudes on the hillsides near the Sea of Galilee, and along its seashore. He did considerable talking to his disciples on the Mount of Olives, in private homes and at the temple. But on the sabbath day you would find Jesus teaching in the “house of our God.” (Neh. 10:39) In proof of this, when Jesus was brought before the chief priest shortly before being put on the torture stake, he unhesitantly said to the chief priest who questioned him about his disciples and about his teaching: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.”—John 18:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those people knew, and Jehovah’s witnesses today know, that the custom of Jesus during his three and a half years of ministering was to attend the meetings of God’s people regularly and to teach them God’s Word there. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses today meet regularly in their Kingdom Halls and preach and teach God’s Word, the Holy Bible, and make this their custom. They, too, “have spoken to the world publicly,” and the religious leaders of the day know it. More than 1,034,268 of Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house customarily every month declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. You will find them going from house to house, studying the Bible in private homes with interested persons and in their Kingdom Halls. From the time a person dedicates his life to do Jehovah’s will and is baptized as Jesus was he must prove himself to be a minister of God as the early Christians did. In the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Outline of History*</span><span class="font6"> it says: “What is clearly apparent is that the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth was a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prophetic teaching</span><span class="font6"> of the new type that began with the Hebrew prophets. It was not priestly, it had no consecrated temple and no altar. It had no rites and ceremonies. Its sacrifice was ‘a broken and a contrite heart.’ Its only organization was an organization of preachers, and its chief function was the sermon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A GOOD CUSTOM FOK US</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the very time that Jesus began his ministry in the fall of 29 C.E. after his baptism, he never neglected his ministry, and he preached sermons in the house of God and in other public places. He set an excellent example for Christians today in that “we should not neglect the house of our God.” (Neh. 10:39) We, too, need to learn and to teach. It is in the house of God that we learn the truth from God’s written Word, and this equips us to give better sermons as we disciple people of all nations of the world to the true Christian faith.—Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the worldwide organization of Jehovah’s witnesses schools are organized, one in every congregation. This school is called Theocratic Ministry School. In it every one of Jehovah’s witnesses may be enrolled, as well as other people who wish to be. In this ministry school you can learn how to express yourself so as to teach. Each one takes his turn on the platform, men and women, and a brief sermon based on some Scripture text is spoken in the Kingdom Hall. Sometimes two or three people will have a Bible discussion on the platform as though it were in someone’s home. Bible sermons, public or private, are based on God’s Word. Using this manner of teach</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* By H. G. Wells, Third Edition, Revised and Rearranged by the Author, pages 522, 523, September 1921. </span><span class="font6">ing, one can make disciples of people of all the nations. This is the way Jesus got his followers. Today Jehovah’s witnesses use the same method to turn the hearts of men to their Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses know that faith comes from hearing. If someone is going to hear, there needs to be a preacher. By making it their custom to assemble in the house of God, Jehovah’s witnesses learn how to teach and preach. From their Kingdom Halls they are sent forth to teach and preach, just as the apostle Paul said they would be. “How . . . will they preach unless they have been sent forth?” (Rom. 10:10-15) Paul here is emphasizing what Jesus said a few days before he ascended into the heavens: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.” —Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being a Christian minister of God today does not mean one has to stand in a pulpit and preach to an audience in some church building. It means every individual Christian’s letting light shine by speaking the truth of God’s Word at every opportunity. His light shines, not only in the customary meeting place, “the house of our God,” but when he delivers a Bible sermon to an individual or a small group of people anywhere in the whole world. Do you “let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens”?—Matt. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All people of all nations are invited to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses at their Kingdom Halls and to take part in their five Bible study meetings, including enrollment in the Theocratic Ministry School. These instructive Bible sessions are held each week for upbuilding the mind and taking in accurate knowledge of the Word of God. Remember, Jesus never neglected “the house of our God.” It was “according to his custom” to be there to learn and to teach. We do well to make it our custom too. “We must not neglect the house of our God” either. We need to know the truth. Let us go where we can find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT IS YOUR RELIGIOUS CUSTOM?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All religions have their “holy days” and special functions in their religious temples. On these special days usually their places of worship are filled. During the time of Christendom’s Christmas festival they put on colorful pageants about Joseph and Mary, the babe Jesus and the shepherds coming to see him. Joyful music is arranged and nearly the entire congregation will attend this service. Even strangers not belonging to the religious group flock in to hear the special music and see the show. Easter Sunday is another one of Christendom’s “holy days,” and it brings the people out for its big spring fashion show of new hats and other finery. Of course, some, who go to the church of their denomination, think seriously of the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus. But why do so many people of Christendom need big attractions like these two “holy days” to get them to their places of worship, just two times out of fifty-two weeks? What real meaning do these two celebrations have for the people who are twice-a-year Christians? Do they really believe that Jesus Christ died to save them? Save them for what? Do you think that after the whole affair is over they feel they are better Christians, or do they feel like hypocrites? What is your own religious custom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is common knowledge that most of the churches of Christendom are crowded out during the Christmas and Easter holidays. But do you, if a churchgoer, ever ask yourself: “Why do I go? Was it my community interest? Was it social interest? Could it be a good business policy?” Maybe you think you will meet some of your political friends there. Did you go because you had nothing more important to do? Stop! Think! Do you really go to your religious meeting place to learn the truth about God and your salvation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real reason for going into the house of God should be to gain knowledge of your Creator, Jehovah, and to learn more about his Son, Christ Jesus, who made provision for all of us to gain everlasting life. You should want to learn about the salvation that God brings to all mankind through his Son by the establishment of God’s kingdom, for which Christians have been taught to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matt. 6:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AV)</span><span class="font6"> Your regularly going to the house of God should improve your thinking ability, and you should come to appreciate that life is a gift from God and you should want to know why mankind is here on the earth. Learning the truth in the house of God should make you want to tell other people what you have learned regarding Jehovah’s provisions for mankind. If your place of worship does not move you to action and make you want to tell others what you learned there, then you had better find the right place to learn the truth and the proper way to worship God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When persons heard Jesus speak they were astounded with his way of teaching and followed him. They learned more truth as each day passed by and they put into practice the things that Jesus taught them. Does your religion do that for you? It was Jesus’ custom to go to the synagogue every sabbath because he knew he would hear the Word of God read from some portion of the Hebrew Scriptures. He knew there would be discussion and an explanation of it too. One sabbath day in Nazareth Jesus was invited to read the Scriptures, and he applied them to himself. He knew he was anointed to declare good news to the poor. This meant for him a lot of traveling from place to place and talking to many people. He told the oppressed Jews that there would be a release of the captives and that freedom would be theirs in due time. How would the promised recovering of sight for the blind come about? Jesus actually made people see with their eyes, but seeing the truth and having an understanding of the Word of God in their heart and mind was far more important. (Luke 4:16-20) His hearers could have all this if they accepted “the kingdom of the heavens,” which was at hand. What preaching and teaching this required! It was a big assignment, but he could fulfill it with Jehovah’s blessing. He was the chief minister to all mankind, announcing God’s kingdom come. Would the people accept him as God’s minister? Jesus said: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matt. 20: 28) Jesus surely would ransom many in God’s due time, and, through His kingdom, we will see God’s will done on earth as in heaven. Does your religion help you to ‘exercise faith in him’ so as to gain everlasting life? (John 3:16) Do you then tell other people what you learn and do you minister to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Jesus came to be a minister himself, he also prepared his disciples to be ministers. He saw to it that his disciples were properly trained in the study of the Word of God and then that they preached that Word regularly. The Christians of our century must do likewise. They must be ministers preaching and teaching the good news of God’s kingdom to everyone.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus had selected his twelve disciples they traveled with him continually, learning and preaching as they went. It was their custom, too, to go to the synagogue and temple and listen to Jesus’ teaching. They were anxious to hear what he had to say. They asked many questions because they desired to learn the things Jesus knew. In public places it was possible for them to engage in interesting discussions. On an occasion they were sent out by twos to preach in Israel. This improved their thinking ability. They had different dispositions and came from various walks of life, and this, too, would add interest to their conversation. For example, Simon and Andrew were fishermen. Jesus had said to them: “Come after me, and I shall cause you to become fishers of men.” They at once abandoned their nets and followed him. He also called John and James at the same time. The five of them went into Capernaum, and “no sooner was it the sabbath than he entered into the synagogue and began to teach. And they became astounded at his way of teaching.” (Mark 1:1622) It was not the powerful and noble men who followed Jesus, but, rather, men whom this world might view as ordinary. However, their being with Jesus and learning from him had a lasting effect on them. We know this because, when the apostles were arrested and appeared before the religious leaders and rulers, they “beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary . . . And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus.” (Acts 4:13) The disciples profited by listening to Jesus’ teaching in the synagogue. It matured them and made them more able ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE APOSTLE PAUL’S CUSTOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The early Christians, like Jesus, knew the value of assembly and used the synagogue in which to preach. After Saul’s conversion from Judaism to Christianity “he got to be for some days with the disciples in Damascus, and immediately in the synagogues he began to preach Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.” (Acts 9:15-20) After he learned the truth it did not take him long to express his belief. Saul, later called Paul, knew that the best place to begin his preaching work was where people were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The disciples of Christ did a lot of traveling. They had to in order to reach all nations. By their going from city to city, from province to province, the good news of God’s kingdom got preached and the Christian congregations grew. When Paul and other Jewish Christians came into a city they always went to the synagogue and preached on the sabbath. They followed the custom of Jesus. Here is a sample of what would happen: “They... went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pi-sidia and, going into the synagogue on the sabbath day, they took a seat. After the public reading of the Law and of the Prophets the presiding officers of the synagogue sent out to them, saying: ‘Brothers, if there is any word of encouragement for the people that you have, tell it.’ So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand, he said: ‘You Israelites and you others that fear God, hear.’ ” (Acts 13: 14-16) Paul was anxious to stand up and declare his faith, and he gave a masterful discourse, as recorded in the thirteenth chapter of Acts. He set out the history of the Jewish people from the time that they were alien residents in Egypt down to the period of the judges and kings. Quickly covering centuries of time, he went on to quote John the Baptist, the prophet announcing Jesus’ coming. Then, to the surprise of all the people, he told of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and declared: “But God raised him up from the dead; and for many days he became visible to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.”—Acts 13:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This sermon by the apostle Paul in the synagogue on the sabbath day certainly caused a stir. “So after the synagogue assembly was dissolved, many of the Jews and of the proselytes who worshiped God followed Paul and Barnabas, who in speaking to them began urging them to continue in the undeserved kindness of God. The next sabbath nearly all the city gathered together to hear the word of Jehovah. When the Jews got sight of the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things being spoken by Paul.” (Acts 13:43-45) It took boldness for Paul and Barnabas, being in the synagogue, to speak out and say to the people: “In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the extremity of the earth.’ When those of the nations heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah, and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.” (Acts 13:47, 48) Right there in the house of God these early believers learned the truth. The reason why they did was that Paul and Barnabas were prepared to give a sermon on God’s Word. They went to the synagogue to tell their faith to others the same as they did when going from house to house or when they were in some other public place. It was urgent upon them to preach the good news any time, any place. It was their custom to talk about the true religion they now embraced. Does your faith in Christ Jesus make it your custom to preach and talk like those early Christians did? It should!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Paul went to Athens he was very much irritated at seeing the city filled with idols and the people worshiping images. “Consequently he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshiped God and every day in the market place with those who happened to be on hand.” Paul was in position on this visit to spend all his time preaching “every day in the market place with those who happened to be on hand.” He must have given many sermons “every day” to groups of persons and individuals because “certain ones of both the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers took to conversing with him controversially, and some would say: ‘What is it this chatterer would like to tell?’ Others: ‘He seems to be a publisher of foreign deities.’ This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.” (Acts 17:17, 18) This gave the apostle Paul a wonderful opportunity to talk with these learned men of Athens. “So they laid hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying: ‘Can we get to know what this new teaching is which is spoken by you?’ ” (Acts 17:19) Paul used this occasion to give a marvelous witness, trusting in Jesus’ words: “For it is not you who will be speaking: it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking in you.”—Matt. 10:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NEB.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian life of Paul was a very active and interesting one. Finally, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth. There he met up with certain Jews, Aquila, who had come from Italy, and Priscilla. Aquila was engaged in the same trade that Paul labored at when he needed funds to keep him in the ministry. Paul stayed at their home and they worked together as tentmakers. “However, he would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks.” (Acts 18:4) That was his religious custom, and he made disciples. What is your religious custom? “However, after staying quite some days longer, Paul said good-by to the brothers and proceeded to sail away for Syria ... So they arrived at Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.” (Acts 18:18, 19) Paul never let an opportunity pass by. He was interested in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, proving that “it is impossible for God to lie.”—Heb. 6:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No matter where Paul went he always planned to be with people and, whenever possible, in “the house of our God” so there could be an interchange of faith. Paul needed encouragement like anyone else and he was always glad to give encouragement. Here is how he expressed it to Christians in Rome: “I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you in order for you to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” (Rom. 1:11, 12) Think of what good you can do for your brothers by expressing yourself in the “house of our God.” Jehovah’s witnesses do this at their weekly meetings in their Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS TODAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religious custom of Jesus and his disciples was to use the “house of our God” to tell other persons the truth, to express their own faith, to get an accurate knowledge of the Bible and to declare God’s kingdom as man’s only hope. Is it the same today in Christendom’s churches as it was in the early Christians’ meeting places? Do you hear the same Bible message about “the kingdom of the heavens” ring in your ears as it used to ring in the ears of those who lived in the time of Christ? Or do you hear in your church that the United Nations is the “last hope” there is? Do you agree with Pope Paul VI when he spoke to the United Nations, saying: “We might call our message a ratification, a solemn moral ratification of this lofty institution. . . . The peoples of the earth turn to the United Nations as the last hope of concord and peace; we presume to present here, with their tribute of honor and of hope, our own tribute also”?<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark97">1</a></sup> Nineteen hundred years ago Jesus Christ rejected the kingdoms of this world offered him by Satan the Devil, and he said to Governor Pilate just before he was put on the torture stake: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 18:36) Today, when the principal religious leader of Christendom says ‘we ratify the United Nations,’ and he tells the peoples of the earth to turn to the United Nations as the last hope of concord and peace, where is his faith and teaching of God’s kingdom? He has none! Do you in an ecumenical spirit want to go along with those who no longer believe the Sacred Bible? Not only have the leaders of Christendom rejected God’s kingdom but they have tried to shatter the faith of their numbers in almost all of Christ’s teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nineteen centuries ago Jesus taught that all in their graves would come forth, that there would be a resurrection of the dead at the hearing of his voice. (John 5:28, 29) How did things get changed so that the clergy of Christendom tell us that man goes to eternal hellfire or purgatory or some few go to heaven? This teaching is strange to a Christian, because the Bible tells him that in Sheol, the grave, where man goes at death, ‘‘there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom.” (Eccl. 9:10) Man is asleep in the grave (Sheol), out of existence. “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Gen. 3:19) Faithful Job knew this, but he also believed in God’s kingdom and the resurrection of the dead. Job said: “O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” (Job 14:13) The Bible teaches that man was created, but science and many of the religious leaders say man has evolved from some lower animal or other form of life. Which one do you believe, man or God? (Gen. 2:7) The Bible says God loved the world so much that he sent his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Son</span><span class="font6"> to save it, but the clergy say that God came, that Christ is God, and to prove it they teach a pagan trinity doctrine. (John 3:16) Jesus Christ quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures, talking about the days of Noah and Sodom and Gomorrah. He believed the written Word of God, but today many of the clergy who claim to be Christ’s followers say the Creation story, Noah and the ark, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and even the virgin birth of Jesus are myths, just stories not to be believed as fact or truth. Regardless of what the leaders of Christendom teach, Jehovah’s witnesses agree with the apostle Paul, who said: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Rom. 3:4) Why such an amazing change in Christian teaching over the centuries? The Bible answers that too.—Genesis, chapters 1 and 2, 6-8; 19:1-29; Exodus, chapter 14; Luke 1:26-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The god of this world, Satan the Devil, has blinded the eyes of the people and has kept them in darkness. (2 Cor. 4:4) Jesus was right when he said concerning the scribes and Pharisees, the religious leaders of his day: “Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (Matt. 15:14) Unfortunately, too many people allow the ministers of the various religious denominations in Christendom to do their thinking for them. It would be far better to study the Bible yourself than to be led astray by false religion. Most people let their clergy do their praying too, and this praying is usually a reading of prayers from some pages of the prayer book. The audience in a religious assembly is not encouraged to express itself. There is no “interchange of encouragement.” How different from Jesus’ day when a scripture was read and then a general discussion ensued! Jehovah’s witnesses still carry on this practice in their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study. The presiding minister states the subject to be discussed, then the scripture around which the comments will center is read. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine is used to guide the general conversation of the whole congregation, but the congregation expresses itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MORAL CUSTOMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About forty or fifty years ago, and before that, there was much more Bible study being done in the private homes of the people than there is today. Many religious organizations used to encourage home Bible reading and study. Today, it seems, the Bible is generally looked upon as a book of fine literature with some good thoughts and expressions in it, something to be read when you have nothing else to do. Many persons say, “How could anyone live by its moral code today? The Bible teaching on fornication and adultery is passe.” So they conclude that, if there is nothing wrong in sex relations before marriage, why not a little variety after marriage? Such promiscuity is going on in Christendom around the world. But what does she do about it? Nothing! Have the clergy closed their eyes to what Paul wrote: “What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom”? (1 Cor. 6:9, 10) One might reason, ‘If Pope Paul VI thinks the UN is “the last hope,” then why consider the idea any more of inheriting God’s kingdom?’ And if there is no faith in God’s kingdom, then it is easy to ignore the moral code of that kingdom. It seems that all Christendom has ignored it. In fact, the world empire of false religion, Babylon the Great, has nothing to offer the people spiritually or morally. That is why God’s written Word says: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues. For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.” (Rev. 18:4, 5) Hundreds of thousands of people have got out of Babylon the Great and are turning to the pure, simple worship of God, and they are becoming real Christians. You will find them today associated with Jehovah’s witnesses because they feel the need of Bible study and association with persons who believe the whole Word of God. These persons have dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will, and their religious custom now is to preach the kingdom of God, which is the only hope for mankind. To keep strong in the faith once delivered to the holy ones, Jehovah’s witnesses meet regularly in the “house of our God” because they know ‘that the friendship with the world is enmity with God. Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.’ (Jas. 4:4) The purpose of the Christian congregation is to build up one another in their most holy faith and to train God’s people to preach the good news contained in God’s Word, not to compromise and be a ‘friend of the world.’ Be a real Christian. Walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Do what he did. Be a Christian every day of the year, not just on Christendom’s “holy days.” Make it your custom to worship in the house of the true God Jehovah and learn what Jesus said: “My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give them everlasting life.”—John 10:27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAS CHRISTENDOM DONE FOR YOU?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the two previous articles in our review of the life of Christ Jesus, the Founder of Christianity, and of Paul, a follower and apostle of Christ Jesus, we learned that it was their custom to go to the “house of our God” on every sabbath. There they would worship Jehovah and preach about God’s kingdom and how to gain everlasting life. Paul had to make a big change in his life so as to become a Christian, and he was the first to admit it. In writing to the congregation in Galatia he said: “You, of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Judaism, that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it, and I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age in my race, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.” (Gal. 1:13, 14) Luke records that as this persecutor was approaching Damascus a brilliant light suddenly flashed around him and he fell to the ground, and Jesus spoke to him, saying: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” (Acts 9:4) Saul was converted to Christianity, and he never lost his zeal for the ministry and preaching in synagogues. “So according to Paul’s custom he went inside to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures. ... As a result some of them became believers and associated themselves with Paul and Silas, and a great multitude of the Greeks who worshiped God and not a few of the principal women did so.”—Acts 17:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a difference between Christianity and Christendom, which was established in the fourth century C.E. So the teaching of true Christianity today can do the same for people as Paul’s teaching did to people in his day. It can make true Christians out of Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Hindus, Moslems, Buddhists and others if they hear and believe. Paul made Christians out of Greeks, Romans and other pagan worshipers. Paul’s Christian ministry had an effect on all kinds of people—men, women, young and old, bond and free, Jews and Greeks. Christianity does not narrow itself down to any special group of people, but the invitation is so inclusive that it reaches out to all kinds of men. If accepted and followed through to its full blessing, it will change a person’s way of life. The change made will be due to love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As all kinds of people study the Word of God and associate with Christians who have been studying the Word of God and live by its teaching, they will see their own personalities change. Paul saw the change a Christian had to make. He made it! That is why he wrote: “You should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but that you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.”—Eph. 4:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This new personality had to be real. It was not just a veneer, something you could show off like a new piece of clothing. This new personality had to be developed by showing love, the kind that Jesus spoke about, loving your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength and loving your neighbor as yourself. (Matt. 22:37-39) Paul pointed out that, even when in the ministry, if you were gifted in languages and could ‘speak in the tongues of men and angels but did not have love, you have become like a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal.’—1 Cor. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul emphasized that this principle of love is very essential in a Christian’s life, because love must be the governing factor or motive in everything a person does after dedicating his life to do God’s will and becoming a Christian. Many philanthropists of Paul’s day were very much like wealthy men today who give to the poor. Even great nations, calling themselves Christian, take of their wealth, usually their surplus of food, and give it to the poor people of other nations that are starving. This is a kind and generous thing to do, but of what benefit is it to the giver nation if these things are not given because of love for that poorer nation? It is just as Paul says: “If I give all my belongings to feed others,... but do not have love, I am not profited at all.” (1 Cor. 13:3) How true! Many men and nations have given out of their plenty for selfish reasons, for political reasons, for personal power, or for influence they gain over others; but if it is not done out of love, what does it profit them? Nothing! For all the good that nations do for other nations they still remain ununited nations. Why? No love! Love is essential for unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So what has Christianity done for you? Have you changed? Have you learned to love people or whole nations? If you have 'not neglected the house of our God’ (Neh. 10:39), then you have come to realize by now that Jehovah “God is love.” (1 John 4:8) You should have learned that even though the first man, Adam, rebelled against his Maker and brought sin and death to mankind, the love of God never changed. Jehovah’s personality would not be upset by someone else’s lack of love. Jehovah’s high principles governing life anywhere in the universe were not interfered with by man’s developing a hatred or lack of love for God, or by man’s dislike for other human creatures. Rather, by going to God’s house you would have learned that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) Is this statement hard for you to believe? Any individual who will attend meetings in a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses will certainly learn about God and how he loved the world of mankind so much that he sent his very first creation, the Word, and arranged for this one, “his only-begotten Son,” to be born of the virgin Mary so that he could take away the sin of the world. (John 1:1; Rev. 3:14; 19:13) This was showing love! John wrote: “By this the love of God was made manifest in our case, because God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him.” —1 John 4:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEED OF FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True Christianity can help you to know that God’s love has reached out so far that it can take hold of you. God’s Son laid down his life willingly to redeem mankind. That would include you if you exercise faith. (John 3:16) With regard to faith, Jesus said to Martha at the time her brother Lazarus died: “ ‘Your brother will rise.’ Martha said to him: ‘I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.’ Jesus said to her: ‘I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life; and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?’ ”—John 11:23-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lazarus was raised from the dead, and Jesus accomplished this wonderful miracle by the power of God before a great crowd. Jesus said to Martha at Lazarus’ tomb: “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” “Therefore they took the stone away. Now Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: ‘Father, I thank you that you have heard me. True, I knew that you always hear me; but on account of the crowd standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that you sent me forth.’ And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: ‘Lazarus, come on out!’ The man that had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his countenance was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them: ‘Loose him and let him go.’ Therefore many of the Jews that had come to Mary and that beheld what he did put faith in him; but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.”—John 11:40-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus had previously said that “the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28, 29) Jesus actually proved that this statement would come true by what he accomplished in the resurrection of Lazarus. This one act of the resurrection of Lazarus certainly showed Jesus’ love. Jesus did not expect any favor from Lazarus because of this good deed. In performing this miracle he brought glory to his Father in heaven, to show mankind what wonderful things God would accomplish through his kingdom by the restoration of the human family to perfect life here upon the earth, the dead being brought forth to life and then on to perfection on this earth, which will blossom like </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">rose. Would you call that love?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you believe Jehovah God loves mankind that much? If you have any doubts, very likely the reason is that you do not go to the “house of our God” regularly and read the Word of God, or talk these Scriptural things over with others so that your faith in God’s Word can be built up. Maybe you think like some of the clergy in Christendom who say that many of the things told in the Bible are not true and never did happen. Who started these doubts in your mind? Not you yourself because of studying God’s Word, but very likely it was the very ones who profess to be the teachers in Christendom. In Jesus’ day he said of the religious leaders: “You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What has Christendom done for you? Put doubts in your mind? Or do you believe God’s written Word? Is Christ Jesus a reality to you? Do you believe he died for mankind? Do you believe that God loved you so much that he provided his only-begotten Son and that he has the power to resurrect those who die? If your faith is so strong and your love so great, will you tell others what you believe? A Christian will!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPROVING IN LOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only way to improve your love is by putting what love you have to work. It takes time, but it can be done if you appreciate that love is based on principle. Love seems to be the pinnacle or goal in the progress made by a Christian in putting on “the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.”—Eph. 4:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peter in writing to Christians of his day showed what progress can be expected when one has faith. He said this: “Supply to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge, to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control endurance, to your endurance godly devotion, to your godly devotion brotherly affection, to your brotherly affection love.” (2 Pet. 1:5-7) The word love is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ag'ape</span><span class="font5"> in the Greek language. According to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, ag'aye</span><span class="font5"> is “spontaneous, self-giving love expressed freely without calculation of cost or gain to the giver or merit on the part of the receiver.” This is the kind of love that Jehovah showed for the sinful world of mankind. It was a love freely expressed without calculation of cost or gain. The love expressed was not something owed to the receiver of it. Arranging to take away the sin of the world was not something God had to do. It was something that mankind gets, but it is undeserved. Is that the kind of love we show to one another and to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus showed that kind of love based on principle. If a Christian walks in Jesus’ footsteps he should show some kind of progress in love. Then Christianity is doing something for him. In Jesus’ sermon on the mount he made this very astonishing statement: “You heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you; that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing? You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”—Matt. 5:43-48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is perfect in expressing his love! He gave his only-begotten Son. God was self-giving, mankind got all the benefit. How can a Christian be perfect in his love just as the heavenly Father is perfect? If a Christian can love and pray for his enemies and those who persecute him, then he is beginning to manifest the same kind of love that his heavenly Father has. Jehovah the Creator of our earth and all the universe allows the sun to rise upon the wicked people as well as on those who are good. There is no distinction. He allows the rain to fall on the righteous people’s land as well as the unrighteous people’s land. He does not show any partiality. His love is far-reaching. Has your study of the Word of God, has your living among Christian people, changed your personality so much that you have this kind of love?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is essential that Christians have love like this if they are going to gain everlasting life. Has your “Christianity” made you love your enemy, made you love those persecuting you and made you love your neighbor? If it is not doing that, maybe you sire lacking in faith, virtue, knowledge and some other things spoken of in God’s Word. Maybe you need to know more about his principles of truth and righteousness. That is why Paul in writing to the Philippians said this: “This is what I continue praying, that your love may abound yet more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment; that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not be stumbling others up to the day of Christ, and may</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">be filled with righteous fruit, which is through Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise” (Phil. 1:9-11) Paul’s argument shows that love grows. It expands, becomes more plentiful. Knowledge and insight of every kind increase with the practice of love. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New English Bible</span><span class="font5"> states the matter this way: “This is my prayer, that your love may grow ever richer and richer in knowledge and insight of every kind, and may thus bring you the gift of true discrimination. Then on the Day of Christ you will be flawless and without blame, reaping the full harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” The footnote on the word “discrimination” in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New English Bible</span><span class="font5"> says: &quot;Or may teach you by experience what things are most worth while.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So accurate knowledge of the Word of God will help you to grow in love. This love will help you to see how wonderful it is of God to allow it to rain upon the righteous and the unrighteous. You will be glad the sun shines and the rain falls on the crops of all mankind so they can eat. If God can do these good things, what should a Christian do? Has your “Christianity” sent you out to declare the good news of God’s kingdom in all the world? Has it made you a minister of God?</span></p>

With love in their hearts they preached the good news of God’s kingdom in 197 different lands, under the direction of 92 branch organizations of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has blessed Jehovah’s witnesses for showing love to their enemies and those who persecute them, because many who have been opposed to the work have now listened to their message, and have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God. In fact, during the last service year there were 64,393 baptized, showing that they have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God. By studying the Word of God they are now gaining accurate knowledge of Jehovah, his Son and his work and they are showing the same kind of love that those who have been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses for many years are showing. To show their love for mankind Jehovah’s witnesses in twelve months of the 1965 service year spent 171,247,644 hours going from house to house and visiting with people in their homes conducting Bible studies. They have made 59,165,475 return visits on interested persons, and each week throughout the entire year 770,595 Bible studies were conducted in the homes of interested persons. These studies are being conducted with the Bible and Bible study books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To aid those who do not even have the time to study an hour once a week millions of copies of books and booklets have been placed with people in 164 different languages, and Jehovah's witnesses were able to place 4,450,687 bound books, 12,326,060 booklets and 135,397,426 magazines throughout the world. In addition to this they were able to get 1,614,146 subscriptions for the two very fine magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the 1965 service year it was necessary for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to print in its printing establishments 119,238,970 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and 110,379,879 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. This makes a total of 229,618,849 magazines printed by the Society and distributed throughout the whole world by subscription and individual-copy distribution. This great witnessing work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses is all voluntary. Jehovah’s witnesses are not paid to go from house to house. Besides that, they spent a lot of money for gasoline, streetcar and bus fares and for other transportation, in order to get to the people everywhere so as to spread the good news. They used a lot of shoe leather in walking country roads through villages, large cities and rural areas, in order to talk to people about the good news of God’s kingdom. God’s love extends to all mankind, and true Christians must show their love too if they would be his Christian witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do this work, because they love God, they love their fellowman, they love their enemies and those who persecute them. Even though persecution may go so far as to result in the death of some of Jehovah’s people, those remaining alive will keep on preaching the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To show you the interest that people have in the work that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing, on April 16, 1965, there were 1,933,089 persons who attended the Memorial of the death of Christ Jesus in the Kingdom Halls and other meeting places used by Jehovah’s witnesses on that special occasion. Of this number, only 11,550 partook of the emblems of bread and wine, indicating they are of the “bride” of Christ and expect to be joint heirs with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory and share with him as kings and priests. This is just a remnant of the 144,000 that Christ Jesus indicated in Revelation would be selected from among all mankind to be with him in heavenly glory, and to rule the earth with Christ Jesus for one thousand years. During this time there will be the resurrection of all those in Sheol, and what an educational work that thousand-year period will provide!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What has your religion—be it Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem or any other—done for you? Has it brought out in you true love, love for neighbor, love for your enemies, love for those who persecute you? Has it made you go and disciple people of all nations and teach them the love of God and the love of his Son Christ Jesus? Has your religion developed in you a new personality with love for all mankind? If it has not done so, then do not neglect the worship of Jehovah God with Jehovah’s witnesses in their Kingdom Halls and learn how to love God and how to love all mankind. Then you will see what Christianity, not Christendom, can do for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE “WORD OF TRUTH” ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The series of assemblies that began in Dublin, Eire, June 9-13, and came to a grand climax in New York City August 24-29 certainly established one thing—Jehovah’s witnesses believe the Bible, Jehovah’s Word of Truth! They study it, they teach it, they live by it! From the very opening talk the chairman emphasized the study of God’s Word. That is what keeps their faith alive. The faith of Jehovah’s witnesses is strong, and they show it too in their activity throughout the entire world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many speakers pointed out time and time again how necessary it is for Christians to preach the Word of truth through their house-to-house witnessing and the conducting of home Bible studies. Others showed that some archaeological finds proved the Bible to be absolutely accurate. Time features written about in the Bible were discussed, as well as important historical dates. With such information one could easily appreciate where he is on the stream of time. Excellent admonition was given on what proper conduct means to Jehovah’s witnesses, and deep study was given to many of the doctrines set forth in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The keynote address set the pattern for the entire convention. It was entitled “Answering the Question, What Is Truth?’ ” That is what Pontius Pilate asked Jesus Christ, as recorded in John 18: 33-38. In an hour-long talk it became very manifest that Jesus Christ is the truth. He is the realization of the truth to which the shadows of the Mosaic Law, as well as the prophecies of the Hebrew Scriptures, pointed forward. Building on this fact and the reason why Jesus came into the world, the discourse made it evident that Jehovah’s Messianic kingdom is the truth and that Jesus was born to bear witness about that kingdom of his Father. Jesus said: “The things I say to you men I do not speak of my own originality; but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works.” (John 14:10) Jesus Christ was shown to be the one chosen by God to be King-Priest, and it is Jesus Christ that Jehovah sets upon His throne to bring life to mankind. Did not Jehovah God say that those who believed on him would gain everlasting life? If we are to originate with the truth we certainly must have the correct understanding of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ and believe in them. Do you believe in them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In making preparations for these assemblies, the Society arranged for many large conventions of God’s people to be held in the smaller countries of Europe, in order to give </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> good witness in these various nations. It was indeed a pleasure for the president and the vice-president to travel to all the conventions in Eire, Scotland and Europe. They were arranged in Oslo, Helsinki, Rotterdam, Luxembourg, Charleroi, Vienna, Basel and West Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all Eire there were only 252 witnesses of Jehovah preaching the good news in 1964, and we wanted to give them good support at their assembly. This was certainly accomplished. In Tolka Park, Dublin, at the opening session of the assembly there were 3,092 in attendance when the chairman gave his opening talk on “God’s Word Keeps Your Faith Alive.” It was a grand assembly, and all those who came from America, the British Isles and the continent of Europe were delighted to be in Dublin and to associate with this little group of faithful witnesses of Jehovah. The warm hospitality of the Irish people was very much appreciated by everyone. All were greatly encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the public address given in Dublin on Sunday afternoon there were 3,948 in attendance, and this in spite of the fact that there was a transportation strike in Dublin during that weekend. We sincerely believe that much interest was aroused in the minds of the people of Dublin so that they will give a hearing ear to the Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the assembly was going on in Dublin, the same program was arranged for our brothers in Scotland. Quite a large gathering of Scots and those from England came together at the Merryfield Rugby Grounds at Edinburgh. City officials in Edinburgh were most cooperative with the convention organization. The president of the Society delivered the public talk in Edinburgh to 31,501, while the vice-president of the Society gave the public address in Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Norway, with its some 4,000 publishers of the Kingdom, was able to organize a fine convention. A beautiful stage setting was constructed, using the whole football playing field. Old Norway came into view before our very eyes, a reproduction of an old Norwegian home with its barns, and grass growing on the roofs, and wooden fences. It was a real Norwegian countryside. All the talks were given in Danish and Norwegian, and on the last day of the assembly 12,332 listened to the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Helsinki, Finland, were truly surprised when upward of 6,000 Swedish witnesses of Jehovah came to the Olympic Stadium with 11,000 Finnish people, where the convention was held. How could so many people of two different nationalities be so closely intertwined and interested in one another? Why so much joy on the faces and in the hearts of these individuals? These were questions in the minds of many Finnish people. This in itself served as a grand witness to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rotterdam was chosen as the assembly city in the Netherlands where the Flemish witnesses from Belgium gathered with the Hollandish of the Netherlands. Throughout the week it was cold and rainy, but the zeal and joy of those attending the assembly was never dampened. When the attendance jumped from 13,974 at Saturday’s principal meeting to 21,816 at Sunday’s public talk, it gave proof of the interest on the part of the people of Rotterdam in what Jehovah’s witnesses had to say on the subject “World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace.” The Sunday public meeting attendance was 55-percent higher than the best weekday attendance of the assembly. This was truly stimulating to Jehovah’s witnesses in the Netherlands, for it is evident that there are people who are interested in the Bible and its message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Luxembourg is a very small country in Europe with a population of 315,000. Jehovah’s witnesses have a good organization operating in that land, with a peak of 378 publishers. Four German circuits of Jehovah’s witnesses from across the border came to Luxembourg. What a delightful time these people of two nations, once at war, had talking to one another about God’s peaceful message during the house-to-house visits in Luxembourg! At the Sunday public meeting there were 3,835 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the Luxembourg assembly was in session, an excellent assembly was in progress in Charleroi, Belgium, where the French of northern France came, along with the French-speaking Belgians. All talks were given in French and Italian. There has been a great migration of Italian-speaking people into Belgium in recent years and it was a delight to see 725 Italian-speaking people at the public lecture, with the grand total of 11,710 in attendance. The whole assembly was in one large building, with the French-speaking Witnesses in one large hall and the Italians in a smaller one. Other large exhibition halls there were used for the cafeteria and refreshment stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this assembly the Italian brothers organized themselves into eleven Italian-speaking congregations. This should now make the organization grow among the Italian-speaking people of Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the following week, July 14-18, conventions were held in Vienna and Basel. Here again the president and the vice-president served both assemblies at different times. During the first part of the convention the Society’s president was in Vienna and the vice-president in Basel. Then toward the end of the week they changed positions in order that they might have fellowship with their brothers coming from distant places to these two cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Vienna there were 1,250 brothers in attendance from Greece. These Christians could not have such an assembly in Greece. They had to leave the country in order to worship Jehovah their God together. The Greek Orthodox Church will not let peaceful Christians assemble together in Greece to worship God, but it seems they have no objection to persons of their own sect rioting in the streets of Greece. What irony! About sixty witnesses of Jehovah came from Turkey too. A fine crowd of Austrians were there, and quite a number of Germans from southern Germany. This was really an international gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses in the stately city of Vienna. The warmth and hospitality shown by all these groups toward one another was a joy to behold. At the public meeting there were 12,266 in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Basel proved to be even more international in scope than did Vienna in that a fine group of Witnesses came from Spain, about 1,880, and a happy group from Portugal, numbering over 360. More would have been in attendance if the border police had not turned some back, and if the government had not canceled some passports when it was learned that these Christians of Portugal were going to an assembly of God’s people in Basel. What is the Roman Catholic Church afraid of? Is it because these people will never return to the Catholic church again? They have now read the Bible, the Word of truth, and are free from false religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were many French-speaking Witnesses in Basel from Switzerland and France, and also Italians from Italy, Switzerland and Germany. Then, of course, the German-speaking people from Switzerland and southwest Germany, along with many from Alsace-Lorraine, came to Basel too. It was really a grand assembly. There were five main platforms in different parts of the large sports field that Jehovah’s witnesses used. Jehovah’s witnesses of all these nationalities had fellowship with one another between sessions, eating at the same cafeteria and hearing the experiences of our brothers from Spain and Portugal and of the persecution under which they must work in order to preach the good news. Spain and Portugal are both supposed to be Christian nations. However, if anyone wants to talk the Bible to a neighbor or friend, or go from house to house to preach the good news of God’s kingdom, he may find himself in jail. Really, in these two countries, Spain and Portugal, the work that Jesus did, and which is being done today by Jehovah’s witnesses, has to be done underground. So Jehovah’s witnesses gladly do this. As you read this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> you will find that excellent progress was made in both of these countries during the 1965 service year. Even though these Catholic-dominated countries hold their people in subjection and ignorance, there are many persons who want to find out what is going to happen to this earth, according to the Bible, and they are anxiously looking for the truth of God’s Word. One often wonders how the apostles Peter and Paul and Christ Jesus himself would be treated if they came to Spain and Portugal in this day and age and preached as they used to. No doubt the same type of persecution would be meted out to them that is brought against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Basel assembly showed once more how wonderful it is for 36,785 of God’s servants and interested persons to dwell together in unity regardless of nationality, language or customs. They truly were peaceful, happy people, filled with God’s spirit and appreciating his Word. They are determined as never before to take the truth from God’s Word to the people of their own land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last of the international European conventions in the summer of 1965 took place in West Berlin. Many came to the convention in Berlin from all parts of Europe. There were about 200 there from East Germany. Only persons over sixty-five years of age were able to get permits to cross through the “Berlin Wall.” The East Germany government has no objection to such ones leaving the country, and they really hope that they do not come back, because they do not want to take care of the elderly people. But Jehovah’s witnesses who were able to attend were indeed anxious to return to East Germany because of the truths they had learned. They wanted to get back as quickly as possible to tell their brothers about the “Word of Truth” Assembly and the things they had learned about God’s people in other parts of the world, and to convey to them the spirit of zeal and determination that Jehovah’s witnesses have in publishing God’s Word and pushing forward with the good news of the Kingdom. They wanted to tell them, too, that 8,916 persons came to the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in West Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When this series of conventions was finished in Europe, the president and the vice-president were privileged to attend the assemblies in Minneapolis and Buffalo respectively, and then they returned to New York for the assembly in Yankee Stadium. This convention had an additional two-day program arranged by the Gilead School. Everyone enjoyed this special portion, along with the rest of the spiritual feast. People throughout the world know of Yankee Stadium, and many of Jehovah’s witnesses the world around have attended previous assemblies there, and it was good to see the stadium and nearby tents packed once again with 74,649 in attendance at the public meeting in English and Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing common to all the conventions was the release of two new publications, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine”</span><span class="font5"> and the beautifully illustrated book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font5"> This latter publication everyone wants in his own language just as soon as possible. Even before any of the conventions got under way, translation of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font5"> had been started and copies of this new book were sent to branches so that translations might be made into sixty languages. Every effort is being made to get the European languages finished first. By the end of the year 1965 at least eleven languages will have this material ready for printing and subsequent distribution, so that a wide distribution of this publication can be made among the people. By the time the Yankee Stadium assembly started there were over 24 million copies of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font5"> printed in English and 350,000 copies in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is believed that this new book will have a phenomenal distribution during its first year of distribution, because Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are anxious to start Bible studies using it and to help those interested in the Word of God to find the truth and take their stand for God’s kingdom, which is mankind’s only hope. A revised edition of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> was also released in English and Spanish at the New York assembly. This too was greatly appreciated by those in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The series of conventions throughout the Northern Hemisphere that began in June of 1965 and ended in August revealed that 614,334 persons attended the public meeting and 11,126 individuals were baptized in symbol of having dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This series of “Word of Truth” conventions will now continue throughout other parts of the world, and by next spring all of Jehovah’s witnesses around the earth will have had the opportunity of learning the fine truths that were brought out by the talks and demonstrations. All will have a greater appreciation of the Word of truth, the Holy Bible, and will know that it is sharper than any two-edged sword. They will realize, too, that it is their responsibility to use the Word of God daily in preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ORGANIZATION OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a religious corporation, and this Society directs the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world. There are many other corporations that Jehovah’s witnesses have found it necessary to establish in order to own property and to carry on their religious activity in different countries. A corporation called Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., looks after the detail work of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States. The International Bible Students Association established in England works in full cooperation with the Pennsylvania corporation. This is true also of the International Bible Students Association of Canada, as well as other corporations in Europe, South America and elsewhere throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religious organization known as Jehovah’s witnesses by millions of people throughout the world is not an incorporated body itself. Jehovah’s witnesses are people who have dedicated their lives to do the will of Jehovah, and they preach the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere. When one speaks about Jehovah’s witnesses one is speaking about Christians who are trying to walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and who are going from house to house declaring the good news of God’s kingdom and conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people. Jehovah’s witnesses are well organized under the Pennsylvania corporation, <a name="bookmark98"></a><a name="bookmark99"></a>and their work is directed through ninety-two branch offices located in all parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These branch offices are assigned to oversee the Christian congregations in certain countries. These countries or territories or island groups are divided into districts and, in turn, the districts are divided into circuits. The office of the president, located in Brooklyn, New York, appoints all branch servants, district servants and circuit servants throughout the world. A district servant visits all the circuits in his district twice each year and has meetings with the circuit servant and congregation overseers in each circuit. During the time that the district servant visits a circuit, a meeting, called a circuit assembly, is held. At such a circuit assembly Jehovah’s witnesses of between twelve and eighteen congregations normally come together for a three-day period of instruction and study of the Bible. All the men appointed to serve as branch, district and circuit servants are ordained ministers, men who have dedicated their lives to the doing of the will of Jehovah God. They have proved themselves devoted men of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregations making up the circuits are presided over by ordained ministers too. These congregations are visited three times each year by the circuit servant. The circuit servant spends an entire week with each congregation. He helps those in the congregation with their problems and engages in house-to-house witnessing work with the individual publishers in the congregations. He aids these publishers, who are also ministers of God, to improve their presentation of the Kingdom message and their handling of return visits, called back-calls, and conducting Bible studies free of charge in the homes of interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant also meets with the overseer of the congregation and the ministerial assistants who make up the body of servants that direct the work of the entire congregation. Sometimes in a city there are a number of congregations that are functioning and the circuit servant visits each congregation for a week at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation overseer has the responsibility each week to see that the five meetings arranged and the service activity itself are carried on properly. He has the responsibility of helping Jehovah’s witnesses, who are brothers and sisters in a spiritual sense. The main responsibility of the congregation overseer is to look after the spiritual welfare of all within the congregation, and his assignment comes from the “Society,” the organization that directs the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To aid these congregation servants to appreciate their obligations and responsibilities, they are invited sometime during their period of administration to attend what is called the Kingdom Ministry School. These religious schools have been organized by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and operate in all parts of the world. This gives the Society the opportunity of training and helping all overseers. The course of study is one month in length. During that time a very careful study of the Bible is made and instruction is given on how the Society’s organization functions around the world so that all congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses will do things in the same manner. It has been possible for the Society, in practically all parts of the world, to bring overseers to its branch offices, or some other convenient location, to give them this special training in the Kingdom Ministry School. These overseers have very much appreciated this training. One congregation overseer wrote that on his return to the congregation from the Kingdom Ministry School he “sat down with his servant body and worked out a program of applying to his congregation things he had learned at the Kingdom Ministry School.” Each month some particular point that he knew would be beneficial to the congregation was discussed with the assistant ministerial servants. One thing each month was stressed on service meetings, at the service centers and in his general discussions among brothers. This worked very well in his congregation, it proved to be most beneficial for all, and the congregation increased in numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that manner, then, those who have gone to the Kingdom Ministry School have been able to pass along the information they received during their month of training to all those making up the congregations. The Kingdom Ministry School is still in operation in the United States, as we have not yet trained all the congregation servants in this country. This school in the United States of America had its beginning in 1959, and up to and including August of 1965, 5,469 persons have been trained. We feel this has proved to be of great benefit to the servants of God who are really interested in helping others to learn the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After all the overseers in the congregations have been trained in all the countries, it may be that the Society will make arrangements to give a special course of training to the assistant congregation overseer. It is hoped that sometime in 1967 a course of Bible study will be so designed that the assistant congregation servant can benefit from a two-week training period. Many of the assistant congregation servants may be able to use their yearly vacation period to attend this Kingdom Ministry School so as to get special training that will better equip them to carry out their assigned responsibilities in the congregation. The training of the overseers has helped the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses to grow to maturity, and individuals have been helped to get a clearer understanding of God’s Word. It has also helped considerably in getting the work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom better organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the Kingdom Ministry School there is also a Theocratic Ministry School in all congregations. This school is beneficial to every one in the congregation, young and old, male and female. This school has been mentioned previously in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> but it is referred to again at this time to show how interested the Society is in training every one of Jehovah’s witnesses to be a qualified minister. We want to aid every person who dedicates his life to Jehovah God to understand Jehovah’s purposes and to feel his responsibility in preaching the good news from house to house and publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is yet another school that has been organized under the direction of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. It is called the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. This school was originally organized to train missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past four years the course has been altered somewhat in order to train branch servants, district and circuit servants from all corners of the earth for administrative capacities. This proved most profitable and aided greatly in making the organization more efficient for the work it has to perform. During the past service year the thirty-ninth class of Gilead graduated. The graduation was on Monday, November 23, 1964. It took place in the spacious Kingdom Hall of the Bethel home in Brooklyn at 107 Columbia Heights. Even though this hall can accommodate over 700 people, it was not large enough to take care of all in attendance. So there were overflow halls on other floors in the building and these were connected by closed-circuit television. Those individuals who could not get into the main hall to hear and watch the graduation of the thirty-ninth class of Gilead were able to see it on television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The thirty-ninth class was composed of very mature brothers, 100 students in all, including a number of branch servants. Their assignments scattered them to fifty-seven different countries in the world. The registrar of the school gives us this report on the graduation day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the graduation program, beginning at three o’clock in the afternoon, brief words of farewell counsel were given by the school instructors, and by the home and factory servants, under whose supervision they had received practical training for three and a half hours each school day, as extracurricular assignments. Brother F. W. Franz, the Society’s vice-president, followed, basing his remarks mostly on Romans, chapter 15, contrasting the true missionary work as the apostle Paul viewed it with the failure of Christendom to carry out the commission Jesus gave his disciples to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all nations. The main graduation talk was then given by Brother N. H. Knorr, the Society’s president. He built his remarks around Matthew 10:40: “He that receives you receives me also, and he that receives me receives him also that sent me forth.’’ Tirelessness and patience were stressed, with counsel to keep constantly in mind the viewpoint that the missionaries would be representing God and Christ, and that, by getting the people to accept them with the message they were bringing, they would be getting these right-hearted ones to draw closer to Jehovah. Moreover, not only would the missionaries help the people to whom they preached, but at the same time they would be receiving training for the expanded work during Christ’s 1.000-year reign, when the billions of dead will be resurrected and will need instruction and training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After Brother Knorr’s talk and the distribution of diplomas and assignments. Brother Johan Eneroth, branch servant of the Society’s Swedish branch and the senior member of the student body, being seventy years of age and graduating with a diploma of merit, read the resolution that had been prepared by the class. Appreciation of the Society’s arrangement for the school was expressed, and special mention was made of the value of the books &quot;AZZ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font2"> in developing in the students a greater appreciation of God’s Word of truth. Especially highlighted in the resolution was the maturity that association with the Bethel family helped to bring. Particular features that were enjoyed were the discussion of the text each morning before breakfast and the privilege of attending the weekly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study with the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mention was made by the president of the school on this graduation day that in the very near future the Gilead School would have two twenty-week courses each year instead of one ten-month course and that preparations were under way for the changing of the curriculum for the fortieth class and the reducing of the course to eight months. It was to be an interim class between the training of branch servants and special representatives of the Society world wide and getting back to the routine training of Jehovah’s witnesses for missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since 1961, when the school was moved from South Lansing, New York, to Brooklyn, attention had been focused on the training of ministers for organizational and managerial work. Now, however, most of the branch servants and many key men in various parts of the world had received their training and so it was time once again to train pioneers and special pioneers for missionary service. This opened the door for many people from many countries, especially the United States, Canada and England, to enter this grand field of service, going into a foreign country, learning to speak their local language and carrying on Christian service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So in March of 1965 the fortieth class got under way in its language studies. The class was divided up into groups that learned Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese. The instructors in these languages were members of the Bethel family or students well versed in the language. The students of the fortieth class also had a most unique opportunity of service during the “Word of Truth” District Assembly in Yankee Stadium in New York City. The class was given the responsibility of handling two days of the convention program, which was arranged for six days. The students did a marvelous job under the direction of the instructors. At the stadium fifty-four classroom desk chairs were placed on the platform, twenty-seven on each side, so that the conventioners could observe the classes and get the feel of the life of a student in Gilead School. The students and instructors put on a very interesting and informative program, and for two days the great audience in the stadium felt they were attending Gilead School with the students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Wednesday, one of the school days, Brother Franz gave a one-hour lecture, as is normally done at school each day of the week. He spoke on the Bible book of Ruth. The following day during the lecture period Brother Knorr spoke for an hour on the subject “Making the Most of Your Opportunities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most unusual feature for the brothers attending the Yankee Stadium assembly was their observing an eight-minute demonstration of each of the five language courses. The instructor said a few words about the need for missionaries to speak the language being taught and then he gave a sample of the opening day when sounds and simple words were being pronounced by the students. This attracted much interest and many in the audience went right along, trying to say the same words or sounds. The students portrayed the difficulties encountered in forming the words in their mouths and pronouncing them. After a few moments the instructor said words to the effect that ‘we now shift from the first day of school to the present time, having studied the language for a number of months.’ Then the whole class was conducted in the language being taught, and no English was used at all. The audience was truly amazed at the way the students could understand the instructor and the excellent response on the part of the students in the language they were studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This two-day program put on by the students was certainly appreciated by those who were able to attend the Yankee Stadium assembly, and all could see that these brothers and sisters were well prepared to carry on the missionary work in the foreign tongue they learned for the country to which they would be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the service year closed, the fortieth class of Gilead was preparing to take their final examinations, and the graduation was to take place September 13. The report on this graduation will appear in the 1967 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those students who graduated during the 1965 service year have been in their foreign assignments for quite some time now, and for the record we list their names.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Outstanding in the United States field service report are the hours spent in the field, the number of new subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> that were taken, the distribution of individual magazines and the back-calls made and the Bible studies conducted. The United States of America has more publishers in it than any other nation on earth, and they have done good work once again. The vacation pioneer work was very well supported during the 1965 service year, and during the month of April there were 25,448 congregation publishers who engaged in the vacation pioneer service. This reflected itself very well in the average number of pioneers for the year, which rose to 13,928. A fine witness was given country wide, even though there was only a 3-percent increase in the average number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family in Brooklyn, New York, were delighted with their share in the ministry, not only going from house to house and associating with the 164 congregations in New York City, but making so many Bibles, books, booklets and magazines for the brothers around the world. Here are some excerpts from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A cradle Catholic” was the description a doctor gave of himself when he was witnessed to by a circuit servant’s wife who received treatment from him each time the town was visited. Before long, his spiritual appetite whetted for truth, he went to the home of a Witness living in the town and asked, “Do you have a couple of books I could read?” The sister was so surprised that she asked, “What kind of books?” He said, “Oh, books about the Bible, you know!” When offered the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font5"> book he said, “Oh, I’ve already read that twice; one of your people called at my lake home last fall and I got it.” Each Wednesday night he has a regular two-hour Bible study and has been attending Sunday meetings. &quot;To show the effort he has put forth to come, at the first meeting he told me he was on call for five doctors and had told the nurse where he would be and that he was playing hookey for an hour. At the time for the next meeting he had </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> whole houseful of kinsfolk, but he excused himself and came along anyway. He was a little late for the third meeting, a public talk—he had to deliver a baby the last thing, but here he came with his Bible and his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> studied, and with his white shoes from the delivery room still on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A salesman of Bibles approached the home of a brother and gave his best sales approach to sell him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> $30 Bible for his “family’s benefit.” The brother brought out his copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font5">and began to compare texts. He showed the importance of a Bible using Jehovah’s name. After several comparisons and stressing the importance of Bible study the salesman asked if he could have a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> for which he gladly contributed $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one home the brother who called was turned away, the woman saying that her Catholic husband would not permit </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in their home. The day was bitter cold, and as the group came back to their car in front of this particular house, they were dismayed that it would not start. As the brothers worked in vain to start the car and the ones inside became colder and colder, the man from the house came out and asked to be of assistance. Nothing seemed to work. The man asked the group to come inside the house to get warm, as the brothers continued to work on the car. He brought hot coffee to the two brothers. Finally, the car was started, and as the brothers went to retrieve the group they found both the husband and wife deep in Bible discussion, one that lasted forty-five minutes. This turned into a second call. They told the brother, “Since your first visit, we have literally lived in the Bible, and we have read it every day.” Now they enjoy a regular Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prayers to the “Sacred Heart” and “Holy Ghost” were devoutly offered by one young man during a Bible study of some duration that was being held with his wife. His prayers for family unity, or conversion of his wife to his religion, seemed to fail when his wife was baptized at an assembly. Three months of mental battle followed. One day, at church, during the mass and communion he offered a sincere prayer to God for enlightenment. That afternoon the wife kindly invited him to the local Kingdom Hall, knowing the terrible mental and spiritual battle he was undergoing. Reluctantly he went. The talk “Do All Religions Lead to Everlasting Life?” was clear and very strong. The genuine friendliness of the brothers and the “lack of rank” were very impressive. His eyes opened! Within forty-eight hours this man took steps to free his family completely from Babylon the Great. All false religious objects were removed from the home, the oldest daughter was removed from parochial school, and the husband was able to give the nun in charge a good witness. The nun admitted that Jehovah’s witnesses know the Bible well and are very zealous. He had spent twelve years in Catholic boarding school and four years more under Jesuit priests in high school; but just one month after hearing the truth, he was engaged in the field ministry. What amazes him most is that he has the precious privilege of praying directly to Jehovah God, a privilege he uses four and five times daily, with obvious continued results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the 1964-65 service year there were sporadic interferences with the preaching work in twenty different states at thirty locations, and some arrests. The charges were for violation of the so-called “Green River” ordinance, license tax, peddlers, anti-solicitation ordinances, and unlawful intrusion on real property. Two arrests in California await trial as the service year ends. Other arrests and threatened arrests were dismissed on trial or prior to trial. In most cases of threatened arrests the authorities withdrew charges upon receipt of letters from the Society or attorneys providing explanations as to the legal position of Jehovah’s witnesses. Two Kingdom Hall permits to build were granted after court action; several cases are pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING ACTIVITY IN BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Brooklyn Bethel family has enjoyed another year filled with blessings. What a pleasure it was to supply Bible literature to our united ministers around the world! To do it we have had to keep all the facilities of the publishing plant very busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a real thrill to all of us to be working in advance on the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,”</span><span class="font5"> knowing it would be greatly appreciated by all the publishers. In order to get a good supply for the various district assemblies and to make consignments to the congregations in the United States, we assembled and bound 1,738,063 English copies and 209,983 Spanish copies during the last four months of the service year. By the end of the service year we had three million copies of this powerful new book off the presses. It was a joy too to send out an advance copy of this publication to sixty different language translators. Already we have received back translated manuscripts and have set in type those in the Italian, the Portuguese and the French languages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To keep our eighteen high-speed web rotary printing presses rolling in the producing of the printed page, 9,898 tons of paper were used, an increase of 757 tons over the previous year. To convert this paper into readable pages required the use of 157 tons of ink, all of which was manufactured in our Brooklyn plant. After the printing is completed, great amounts of adhesives are utilized in holding the various parts of the books together and also in the wrapping of the magazines. Meeting this need required our manufacturing eighty-four tons of adhesives during the past year. Not only were our ink mills busy making ink, but they also produced 2,357 gallons of paint used by the Society to keep all its buildings in neat appearance inside and outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the 438 members of the Bethel family working in the publishing plant, there are 231 that work in the offices and various departments of the Bethel home. In these offices 829,354 pieces of mail were received and 380,633 dispatched during the past service year. The Brooklyn Bethel family are very grateful for the privilege of associating and serving with many of the 164 congregations in New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additionally, many of the Bethel family had the privilege during the year of serving as public speakers on weekends in congregations within a 200-mile radius of New York City. To fulfill this service they handled 2,300 of these speaking appointments this past year. Adding to the enjoyment of serving at the Bethel home has been the dwelling with us of one hundred and eight Gilead School students of the fortieth class, which graduated September 13, 1965. Supplementing their classroom study was the practical training they received in the factory, office and home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT ON OTHER TERRITORIES ENDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 1965 the Brooklyn branch office looked after the territories of Bermuda, Guam, Ponape, Saipan, Sudan and Truk Islands. Here are some interesting experiences from each of these locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 464</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The progress of the work in Bermuda has not been so spectacular as in the past two years, but increase has been made and there is wonderful potential for the year that lies ahead of us. The attendance of over seventy American visitors for the “Word of Truth” Assembly was appreciated. There was a peak attendance of two hundred and eighty-six at the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new Kingdom Hall, completed toward the end of the past service year, was dedicated by Brother Knorr in October and has proved to be a wonderful help in furthering the work in this island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many publishers have profited by inviting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> in the home to join in the Bible study. Sometimes a study is started with a parent and then the children are encouraged to participate; sometimes with a younger person, and then this interest is cultivated in the parent. In this way a twelve-year-old boy joined in his mother’s study and after only two weeks he started attending the service center. He has taken a bold stand for the truth, enduring much mocking from his companions because of applying knowledge gained and trying to live according to Christian principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were pleasantly surprised one day recently to receive a letter from a welfare worker at the local hospital for elderly people requesting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines for the inmates. It said how much these people appreciated the magazines and that they would be very pleased to receive a regular supply of them. A pioneer sister took these magazines and was able to start a weekly reading session for some of these folks. Although almost all of them have been associated with a particular religion for fifty or sixty years, they are learning new things, and have been stimulated to ask interesting and intelligent questions. Many of the orderlies and nurses’ aids listen in, and one of the orderlies has become so curious as to come to the Kingdom Hall to see what it is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46,993</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 783</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The highlight of the service year here on Guam was the visit of the Society’s president, Brother Knorr. The people were amazed that he would take time to visit this small island and its one congregation of brothers. Brother Knorr gave the main talk at our assembly, with a peak attendance of 131. Truly Jehovah’s “faithful and discreet slave” organization feeds and tenderly cares for all the “sheep” regardless of where they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A schoolteacher and an engineer with their families have come to Guam to serve where the need is great. This is proving to be a wonderful experience for them, as well as a great aid to the congregation. Their abilities were very useful in finishing the new Kingdom Hall, and we now have a lovely place in which to hold our meetings and to which to invite the people of Guam. The brother who is a schoolteacher has stood firm for right principles such as the flag-salute issue, and this has made a good impression on his fellow teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister whose husband is serving in the military here had a good opportunity to do incidental witnessing aboard ship on the way to Guam. She was able to witness to all the passengers but one. Although she visited with her, she was not able to witness to her. Upon arrival here and getting settled in their housing area, the children of the sister found the same lady living close to their house. The sister went to visit her. This time she was able to witness to her. Of all the ones on the ship, this lady proved to have the listening ear. Literature was placed and a study started. The good news she is learning is helping her to make some changes in her life. During her first marriage she and her husband had an auto accident and she suffered the loss of one hand. She had held a grudge against him and had never forgiven him for this. Later, they were divorced and she remarried. She told the sister who studies with her that now she knows that God is not to blame for everything. She has written to her former husband, telling how she has found the truth and could not bear a grudge against him any longer, forgiving him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At a funeral of a Mokilese islander recently a heated argument arose over who had the true “way.” Was it the Protestants or the new Witness missionaries? So heated did the argument become that a fierce fight loomed when the opposed Protestants forced a group of persons who had recently begun studying with the Witnesses to defend themselves. Before the first blow was delivered, however, an elderly and respected preacher of the Mokilese people broke it up, saying: “Stop fighting over who has the true way. The Witness missionaries visit me and they know more about the Bible than all of you people put together.” With that, things cooled, and later, upon visiting those who wanted to defend the truth with force, we were able to point out the need for mildness and respect for the right of others to hold to their beliefs, and upon our showing them Matthew 5:44 and 2 Timothy 2:24, one man exclaimed: “I don’t think the Protestants have ever read this.” He then made a note of it and was determined to show it to those who were opposed, and added: “But with love, as true Christians don’t need to fight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth has spread to all municipalities on the island as well as to a number of the surrounding islands in the district itself. While eating lunch in a native restaurant the Witnesses were approached by the chief magistrate of Nukuoro Island. Noticing the missionaries eating there, he asked a friend why they were eating in a native restaurant as there is “Ameri-can-style” service at the hotel. The friend replied: “Because them is Jehovah’s witnesses.” He then asked: “What’s Jehovah’s witnesses?” “I don’t know, but that’s why they come here,” was the reply. Knowing some law, he was familiar with the word “witness” and also knew God’s name. Figuring it out, he then approached the missionaries and asked them to teach him the Bible. A study was arranged three times a week, it being conducted in broken Ponapean, Nukuoron and English. He has accepted literature and is looking forward to returning to teach his people the “good news.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One of the outstanding features of the preaching work on Saipan was the visit of the circuit servant and his wife and the showing of the movie “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World.” Although announcements were made by the Catholic priests in all villages, warning the people not to see the movie, many proved they were not in complete subjection to them. The mayor gave complete cooperation in arranging the showing of it in auditoriums of four villages, even providing the benches and the projector. As a result, 228 attended the eye-opening movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has many ways of finding his “sheep,” and one way was through the beautiful calendar Jehovah’s people had in 1965. Two of these calendars were placed with persons having Bible studies in their homes and they were hung in a conspicuous place on their walls. One day a relative from one of the nearby islands of the Marianas visited them and he noticed the calendar and the text at Matthew 10:28, with which he had been familiar: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.” He asked his relative where she obtained the calendar, and she said she obtained it from Jehovah’s witnesses. He asked her who they were, and she told him they were ministers who were teaching her the Bible twice a week in her home. He stated that he would like to meet them, as he was quite interested in the Bible. So one day he was introduced to the missionaries, and he stated how happy he was that there were people on Saipan who were interested in helping other people to gain a knowledge of the Bible. A Bible study was started, and many questions were answered to his satisfaction from the Bible. The circuit servant also visited him, and he admitted to him that Jehovah’s witnesses did not try to force him but that they just reasoned with him from the Bible and let him make up his own mind. He became so interested in the truth that soon he was spending more than one hour for his studies; in fact, one day studying for six hours. Another time visitors came while he was studying, but he excused himself and explained to them that he was studying the Bible and that they could wait for him if they desired. He explained to the missionaries that he felt his Bible study was more important than entertaining visitors. He also has been witnessing to many of his co-workers and has expressed to them that they should be very grateful that Jehovah’s witnesses are on Saipan to help the people and should take advantage of the Bible knowledge they could gain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year it was possible for one of the brothers to visit the congregation in Sudan and arrange for a little circuit assembly. The brothers greatly appreciated this provision and the showing of the Society’s film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the special pioneers serving in Sudan reports that she has a study with a nurse, and the woman for whom the nurse has been working asked her to find out from the sister where “Jehovah” is written in the Bible and why we do not go to church to pray or believe in the cross. So the pioneer sister wrote the woman a letter and sent her a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,” </span><span class="font5">explaining how to use the index to find the answer to her questions and also offering her help. However, the next week the woman told the nurse that she did not want the sister to come to see her, as the priest had forbidden it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, it so happened that on Sunday morning the sister went to her Bible study after going in the house-to-house ministry and found a number of women visiting. So she witnessed to them and placed literature. Then they had the study and were surprised to learn from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book that paradise will be restored to this earth. At the end of the study the sister asked for the names of those present and found that one was the lady for whom the nurse had been working. She was now interested because of listening to the study and asked to have a study conducted with her personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,344</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Truk District is located in the eastern Caroline Islands of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. It includes the Truk Atoll, the Mortlock, Hall and Western Islands, with a total of about forty inhabited islands scattered over an area of about 180,000 square miles. The Society’s first missionaries arrived on March 20, 1965, to live on Moen Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An organized campaign to expel the missionaries from the District was started soon after their arrival. The Catholic church printed and distributed a four-page leaflet against Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Protestants called a meeting of all the ministers of the fourteen islands of the Truk Atoll, there presenting a petition to the group addressed to the High Commissioner, asking him to remove the Witness missionaries, since there were already two religions here and they could take care of the people. After nearly all the Trukese ministers signed the petition, the chairman of the meeting, who was responsible to send it to the High Commissioner, hesitated for several months because the Protestant missionaries who first drew up the petition declined to sign it, trying to give the impression that it was strictly a “Trukese affair.” At the time of this writing nothing has come of this effort. If it is Jehovah’s will for the humble people of these many islands to have the opportunity to learn the truth, nothing Satan’s agents can do will prevent it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">While the scars of the earthquake are still to be seen in Alaska, this far northern territory is rapidly being rebuilt, and Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying the good news to all parts they can possibly reach. There is a great amount of interest found in the field, but the population living there is on the move. Still, strong congregations are being established and there are now twelve in Alaska. Here are two very fine experiences, one in connection with looking after a person who some time ago had been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses and the other on writing to persons not often seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few years ago a brother who had been associated with the Truth and had even been a study conductor moved to Alaska. But he fell away and became inactive. Some who tried to help him gave up in discouragement, as he seemed to reject their interest. One mature brother persevered in encouraging him, and gradually he started back again with determination. Later, another inactive one was helped by this same mature brother, although he, too, was preoccupied with other things and lacked interest at first. In time the first “inactive” brother took over the assistance of the second “inactive” one, and today these are two zealous brothers. During the past year and a half they were appointed the assistant congregation servant and Bible study servant of one of the larger congregations in Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Letter writing plays an important part in the witness work in Alaska because, in many cases, this is the only way to make contact with isolated persons and with those who have only a post-office address. A pioneer wrote a letter to a person whose subscription had expired but whose address was just a box number. One evening there was a knock at the pioneer’s door and there stood a man and his wife with books under their arms. They explained that in order to make this visit they had hired a baby-sitter for the second straight night. The man commented: “When it comes to religion, I can make just as many excuses as the next person, but when someone takes the time to write me a letter about it, I figure it’s time to do something!” Their books turned out to be Bible research books. During the discussion it was the interested man who asked if they could not study this matter subject by subject, and do so on a regular basis, say, once a week for an hour or two. Needless to say, a study is now being conducted with this family, and, through them, another one is being held with their neighbor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have every reason to be happy and feel like the psalmist who said: “Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God.” (Ps. 146:5) The ministers of God in Argentina have had Jehovah’s help because good progress was made during the year. Many interested people took their stand with Jehovah’s organization and have become zealous in the field ministry. Through the good efforts of all of Jehovah’s witnesses new alltime peaks in hours, subscriptions, magazines, back-calls and Bible studies have been reached, and very likely the vacation pioneer work helped in all of this. Here are some interesting reports that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the very start of the service year we emphasized vacation pioneer work. There were 141 on the list in September, and the goal was approximately 700 for the month of April, the former year having had 585.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applications began to arrive and, to our surprise, 1,054 were on the list and working in April. This meant that more than 10 percent of the congregation publishers were in the vacation pioneer work. The total number during the year was 2,502.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A congregation servant writes: “I thought that the vacation pioneer work was not for me, since I work to meet family obligations and am congregation servant while my wife is a regular pioneer. What a joy for me to finish a happy vacation together with her enjoying many experiences every day along with ten other publishers in the congregation and to be counted among the over one thousand in the vacation pioneer service! I am sure that this opportunity will be repeated. It is my pleasure to report, ‘We made it’—the 20-percent increase of publishers in the congregation. This we were able to reach with the help of the vacation pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some think that pioneer service is a privilege only for those not having children or those who live in the city. Not so, for one congregation servant with eight children did it, and a sister in the same congregation with ten children did it. One of them continued in the vacation pioneer service for two whole months. These brothers did the vacation pioneer service in rural territory, not by car but on foot in the mountains and hilly territory of the province of Misiones. This sister lives seven kilometers from the Kingdom Hall. They recommend vacation pioneer service for you too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The need to ‘go on walking in wisdom toward those outside’ is seen in the experience of two special pioneers. An interested person gave them living quarters in the attic; as the home was a boarding house, there were many families living there. The lady and her young son began to study but under trying conditions. Communist, Methodist and atheist were all living there. Regardless of the cold war carried on against the lady of the house, the study progressed. A Methodist woman gave her literature against Jehovah’s witnesses at the instigation of her pastor. Then the Methodist broke away from her after eight years of friendly relationship. But it was soon shown who had the truth when the Methodist woman suggested that those of the Methodist church preach from house to house as do Jehovah’s witnesses. There was no interest in this and the wife of the pastor discouraged it. After this a Bible study was requested and now the Methodist woman is a publisher of the “good news.” Also, other former opposers are now studying. A service center has been established in the boarding house now, with an average attendance of twenty, and twelve of these are from the home. The encouragement and example of the two pioneers brought these people the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work has increased so much in the past year that our present printing equipment is not able to care for it all; so a new automatic flatbed press has been purchased, and it is to be delivered this month. With this new equipment it is our hope that we will be able to get all our work up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,312,577</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17,137 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 660</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just as the service year came to a close in Australia the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font6"> arrived there. These were distributed, and the branch servant tells us that the Kingdom publishers are extremely pleased with the book. A number of them described it something like this: “A book that would practically bring one into the truth just by reading it even without a study.” Very likely in the next service year they will have many good experiences with this publication, but now we print a few interesting items on what happened in Australia during the 1965 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers here during the past year have been very busy carrying out waterfront witnessing at nearly all Australian ports, much like the early Christian congregations did in the days of the apostle Paul. As a result of diligently following through by writing to those who show interest, success is being had, with Jehovah’s blessing. The following reply sent back to one of the brothers doing this type of work shows the great need for holding to one’s promises: “Thanks for your nice letter. It is good to know that there are still some people left who can keep their word regarding their promise to write me. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5"> hope all your people are well and still following the right path—Jehovah’s, I mean. Would you give my kind regards to your wife, also the big Dutchman and his wife I met at your meeting. I met some really earnest folk. I respect you, your brothers and your faith. Hoping to see you in the near future, and to hear you at another meeting. Ask your brothers to include me in their worship of Jehovah. My best regards to you.” By diligently following through on the promises made and keeping up our contact with people by letter writing, our genuine concern can easily be detected by interested ones and it draws them closer to the truth, as in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effort and example of some of our elderly brothers are very encouraging and commendable. One sister wrote about her father, how he was an elderly man at the time of his receiving the truth. Owing to a hip injury, he was unable to walk any great distance, and after some time of persevering and with increasing age he found he could not walk much at all. He made himself a little wooden stand and on this he made several shelves wide enough to hold the Society’s publications. He then got permission to sit on a chair with this little stand alongside him and display literature on it outside a supermarket on Saturday mornings. People regularly took magazines from him, and his very presence was a witness to passersby. Recently, his daughter met a brother who related to her how he used to see her father regularly sitting by his little stand with literature on it. Although he had learned the truth as a young boy, he had never dedicated his life to Jehovah. But seeing the sister’s father faithfully serving in this way, he decided he must do something about it, and now not only is the young brother dedicated, but he is also serving Jehovah in the pioneer ministry. Sometimes the older brothers, like this one, do not realize how much their faithful example contributes toward turning people to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although some adverse publicity is experienced from time to time by our brothers due to different issues that come up, it is also interesting to see some of the good results such publicity brings. During the year one of our sisters died while remaining loyal on the blood issue, and the news was reported across the country. An overseer wrote to tell the Society the experience he had due to this. A local rabbi obtained his name from the telephone directory and rang to ask if he would be prepared to explain to a meeting of Jewish women the reason for the stand we take, even to the point of death. These Jewish women had asked the rabbi this same question about the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses and he had been unable to answer them. The congregation servant accepted the invitation and went along with his assistant and was somewhat surprised to find seventy women in the meeting hall. The overseer used the Jewish Bible and explained for about twenty minutes our stand on blood. Then there was a period of questioning, with most of the questions coming from the rabbi himself. Finally, questions ran</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">out and they heartily showed their appreciation for the visit with a round of applause, with many waves and smiles as the brothers left. The brothers had come well prepared and had the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font5"> booklet with them and, with the rabbi’s permission, left a copy with each of those present. So even though we may think adverse publicity is not so good at the time, it may work out in favor of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,172,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During 1965 the outstanding event in Austria was the international assembly held in Vienna. Austrian and German brothers joyfully assembled together, and a separate hall was used for 1,250 Greek brothers from Greece, and then there was a good group of Turkish brothers that were there too. The warmth and love displayed among all these brothers of different nationalities was delightful and, again, was a true mark of how Jehovah’s holy spirit operates on all kinds of people, and shows that individuals from all nations can come together and serve Jehovah God. There have been many interesting experiences in Austria, too, and here are a few as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister working in an office boldly used office break periods to witness and was able to place a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> with a young girl and started a home Bible study with her, which she conducted after work. The girl’s parents noticed a change in her, however, and, upon their discovery of her contact with Jehovah’s witnesses, a storm of opposition broke forth. To get her mind on other matters, they had her take a course Saturdays at a private business school in another city. During a class intermission, the interested girl saw a young brother doing street work. Was fear of her parents going to subdue her interest for God’s Word and work? Not at all! She approached the brother, asked him for two magazines and began doing street work then and there! She placed six borrowed magazines in no time at all. After she had made further progress, a brother made arrangements to call on the girl’s parents with her and talk to them about Jehovah’s witnesses—not an easy task for him, knowing their attitude toward the truth. But contrary to expectations, her parents listened to the brother, and their attitude improved. When the “Word of Truth” Assemblies drew near, the young girl was invited to attend in Basel, Switzerland, and again courage and faith in Jehovah won out. She was immersed, the storm clouds have passed away and she is continuing to serve Jehovah as one of his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers, too, had opportunity to expand their service this year by working some of Austria’s isolated territories during the summer months. In August a married couple arrived in their territory late and therefore decided to spend the first night in a rooming house. The brother looked for someone with a car to assist him with his baggage and cartons of literature. A friendly man who helped him asked whether the brother was on vacation there. A conversation about the truth ensued. Later, two back-calls were made on Mr. W---. The result? He became so interested that he</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">told the special pioneers that as many persons in his town as they might get interested could have meetings in his home. No fear of man in that offer! Mr. W---</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">wanted others to hear the message too. A few more calls were made on him before the couple returned to their home assignment. What a surprise it was for them when Mr. W--- later called on them to take</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">them to the book study in the nearest congregation territory, a thirty-mile drive for him! And at 8:30 a.m. the next day, with pouring rain outside, the special pioneer couple experienced another surprise: Mr. W---</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">was out in front of the house with his car to drive them to their field service territory, for, as he explained, he could not expect them to ride to their territory on their motor bicycle in that weather! So he drove them to their territory and brought them home again afterward. Only a little over one month after their first call on him, Mr. W—— wrote them a letter addressing them as his ‘prospective brothers.’ He was attending some of the meetings of the nearest congregation and said he was now beginning to understand why Jehovah’s witnesses were happy all the day long. He himself was beginning to receive that same joy through God’s Word.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark101"></a>During the past year Jehovah’s witnesses have worked on eleven of the fifteen islands that make up the Bahama group. The visits to these islands have encouraged the more mature brothers to plan to move to some of them. It is just like going to work where the need is great, and it is good that some of the brothers are definitely working toward that end. Jehovah’s witnesses, having served another year, can view in retrospect and with satisfaction the many things they were able to accomplish, and they give thanks to Jehovah for the privileges that have been theirs. Eleven more persons on the islands have been baptized in symbol of their dedication to the doing of Jehovah’s will. Here are some experiences that were sent in by the branch servant.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">A young woman became interested in the truth because of the kindness shown toward her by the brothers at a circuit assembly she had been invited to attend. After arrangements to study with a special pioneer on her home island fell through, it was agreed that she study with a missionary in Nassau by correspondence. Because of her studiousness and her sincere desire to learn, a chapter a week was covered in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font5"> As the missionary said: “Her answers were all in her own words and to the point. She is able to pick out details and reasons well.” After finishing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,&quot; “This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> was studied. In August she expressed her purpose to dedicate her life to serving Jehovah and to be baptized, this in opposition to her well-meaning mother. She carried out her determination at the “Word of Truth” Assembly, leaving her secular work and making the trip by plane. Thus it can be seen that kindness can lead to the saving of a life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are always under observation, and this is well illustrated by what took place during the construction of a Kingdom Hall on the island of Eleuthera. A middle-aged woman who had had her faith sorely tried by the many religions she had joined or attended in her search for the truth observed the love, unity and cooperation of the brothers as they constructed their Kingdom Hall. As a result, she began to have a study and attend the meetings, even attending an assembly in Nassau. When she learned what God’s requirements are on marriage, she gave back to the man with whom she was living his ring, and wrote to her legal husband to see if they could now have a successful marriage. She now tells her neighbors and friends that the religion that she belonged to could not be the true one, as she was not told that the life she was living was an unclean one and displeasing to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year an effort was made to reach the many thousands of French- and Creole-speaking Haitians that have fled here because of the poverty in their native land. A French-speaking brother spent the winter here placing much literature, and he organized a regular </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and a book study. Another sister came and is working as a special pioneer. She finds the Haitians very humble and lovers of the Bible. This sister says: “It is the first time I have had the opportunity to work among such humble people, many of whom are thirsting for the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The highlight of the activity in Belgium during the past year was the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Charleroi, July 7-11. At the assembly the president of the Society arranged for the Italianspeaking brothers living in Belgium to be organized into congregations. On September 1, 1965, ten new congregations began functioning. Of course, this means the forming of an Italian circuit in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The French and Italian assembly in Charleroi made a lasting impression on the director of the hall that was used. He said: “I must tell you that it was a real pleasure to have such dynamic and correct people as you for tenants. Congratulations for such a magnificent congress.” 'Hie brothers were very enthusiastic about their assembly, and here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s organization here in Belgium has never had to cater for such a large gathering before and His blessing and direction were manifest in many respects, before, during and also after the assembly. It was a pleasure to have both Brother Knorr and Brother Franz with us during those few days, and since the assembly we have noted many improvements in the work here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result of preconvention work, the following experience is related: While we were seeking rooms, we met a 74-year-old lady who, unable to offer rooms, accepted the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font5"> A study was started and a visit fixed for the following week. She was waiting, booklet underlined and completely read, and in agreement with all it said about present conditions. However, she could not accept the fact that God had a name. She was asked to look in her dictionary, and how surprised she was to see that her dictionary said that God’s name is Jehovah! “It’s not possible,” she said, “that I had to wait until I was 74 years old before knowing the name of my God!” After two months of study, a few weeks ago, she did away with all her idols. As the publisher looked at the empty spaces, the lady said with tears in her eyes: “You have noticed what I have done then?” How quickly she had shown her obedience to the second of the Ten Commandments that had been studied only the previous week! She explained that she was now praying to Jehovah, and she has just attended her first Christian assembly—Charleroi in July 1965!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This experience shows the importance of presenting the month’s offer on our magazine routes. From August to November 1964 magazines were delivered to a young woman in a store. In November the offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font5"> was accepted. By the very next visit she had already read the book, and the sister saw immediately by the person’s remarks that the book had made an impression. She saw just by her own personal reading the importance of speaking the Bible truths to others and of dedicating herself to Jehovah (yes, she was already using God’s name). A study was immediately started in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After three weeks of study the sister spoke about the meetings and from the next week in December she was attending all five meetings. She obtained all the publications necessary for her to profit to the full from the meetings and very soon she was taking part intelligently in the meetings, by replying from her well-marked copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> In March she began to take part in field service and it was amazing to see the change in her personality and habits in such a short time. She stopped smoking in spite of the internal fight to do so. Just recently at the “Word of Truth” Assembly she was among the 310 candidates for baptism and since then has been making splendid progress. This experience also shows that language or nationality is no real barrier. Why not? Because it was a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font5"> sister who contacted this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Belgian</span><span class="font5"> lady in her store and who followed through on all the visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About eighteen months ago a brother died, leaving his wife, who is in the truth, with the responsibility of bringing up their five children, the eldest being fourteen years old and the youngest seven. The sister decided to organize her time with her family. Each day, Monday through Sunday, something definite was undertaken: Monday, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study; Tuesday, preparation for Service Meeting and Ministry School; Wednesday, preparation for group study that takes place at her house on Thursday evening; Friday, a private study with the children; Saturday, some of the children go out in the service, the others having participated Wednesday afternoon; Sunday, field service and Kingdom Hall meeting. As a result, four children are regular publishers reaching their goals. The mother, in spite of having five children, was able to vacation pioneer twice during the year. They live six miles from the Kingdom Hall and travel is difficult, but they never miss a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,604,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 614 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,870</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bolivia has had one of those years when the witness work seems to have leveled off for a season. This does not mean, though, that the brothers have not been active in the worship of their God, Jehovah. More hours were spent witnessing and more individuals were baptized than during the previous two years, but the past year has seen the loss of some brothers, and much time was spent helping those in the truth who are part of the “great crowd” to appreciate their responsibility of taking on greater privileges of service and giving the congregations proper leadership. Some very interesting experiences have been reported by the branch servant, and here are a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer sister writes from a small isolated group where she is assigned: “One Sunday while working from house to house I met a man who said that he had waited a long time for this visit. He had the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and had read it at various times. We made arrangements for a study immediately and that same day he came to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and, since then, has never missed any meetings. As we continued our studies he saw the necessity of sharing in giving the information to others, but there was an obstacle —he was not legally married to his mate. I explained the necessity of this, and he was ready and willing, but not so the mate, in spite of his and my efforts to convince her. The time came for a circuit assembly, and we were preparing to attend. The man had decided to separate from the woman and serve Jehovah. However, the assembly program and the love and unity this man saw among the brothers encouraged him to speak once again to his mate about marriage, and this time he was successful. They were married and now he is a regular publisher, enthusiastically prepares for the meetings, is conducting a study of his own and is awaiting the next assembly to symbolize his dedication by water baptism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This joyous experience is from a missionary sister who went to a new assignment with her husband. She says that while in the magazine work on a Saturday morning she found a young woman who said she did not read ‘those magazines.* After explaining that they both believed in the Bible she was able to give a short witness. She talked about the hope for the dead, which turned out to be very appropriate, as the woman’s husband had discussed the subject with a Witness a short time before and had his faith in his church shaken. The woman did not take the magazines at that time, but showed enough interest so that the sister called back from time to time and talked with her and sometimes with the husband. Then after returning from an assembly and vacation, she visited them and found them worried that she was not coming back. She relates: “That night they both came to the book study at the Kingdom Hall and showed much appreciation for the study. Afterward they asked many questions, which were answered to their satisfaction. The next day the man came to study with my husband and again was overjoyed at the precious truths he was receiving from God’s Word. Then he went to the preacher of his church and told him he was not going to attend church anymore but that when he ‘knew the Bible like Jehovah’s witnesses’ he was ‘coming back and take every member you have to the Kingdom Hall.’ That worried the preacher so much that he came to the shop when I was studying with the wife and we battled (with ‘the sword of the spirit’) for two hours. As a result, the woman saw through the preacher, and the husband looked up the preacher again and told him, ‘The sister (speaking of me) is coming every week to study with my wife, and I warn you that if I find you setting your foot in the shop again, you won’t have two women to contend with, but me.’ This sheeplike individual worked many hours in the service in the month since then, gave his first student talk in the Theocratic Ministry School and expressed his desire to symbolize his dedication to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 79,924,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 36,325 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,200</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ministers in Brazil have good reason to rejoice, because they see the spiritual prosperity of Jehovah’s organization. Month by month as their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font6"> reached them the publishers would observe the continual increase of publishers and they were happy to be sharing in the blessings promised in Proverbs 15:30: “A report that is good makes the bones fat.” Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed a 12-percent increase in new ministers in Brazil during the 1965 service year, and the branch servant has sent in some very interesting experiences that show the zeal and joy of the brothers in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the highlights of the year’s activity was the vacation pioneer service. As in other parts of the world, the publishers in Brazil responded enthusiastically to the opportunity of spending two or more weeks in the full-time service. The previous year’s peak of 836 vacation pioneers was more than doubled when 1,895 reported in July. It was a real sacrifice for many to share in this privilege, but it brought them many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One sister who lives on the Amazon River arranged to vacation pioneer even though she has five children. She would get up early each day and do her work in the home, leave the oldest child in charge of the smaller ones, take one or two with her, and then travel by canoe each day for two or more hours to get to her territory. She reports that she hopes to pioneer again. A congregation in the north of the country wrote that they expected the average hours for the congregation to drop considerably when seventeen publishers applied for vacation pioneer service. But these pioneers helped the weaker ones in the congregation and the average hours went up considerably, to 15.2 per publisher. From another part of the country a publisher reported at the end of the month that she had been afraid she would be unable to do the work, but she was able to meet the vacation pioneer requirements and said: “The days from the 1st to the 31st of July were, for me, the happiest days of my life.” Another sister wrote that after serving a month as a vacation pioneer she had far greater appreciation for the service and is now making plans to enter the regular pioneer work. In one unit in Salvador twenty-six publishers served as vacation pioneers in July, including all the servants and study conductors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have expressed appreciation for the work that has been done in preparing and producing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </span><span class="font5">in Portuguese. A family of publishers moved next door to a man who had opposed Jehovah’s witnesses for years. His wife asked the Witnesses not to speak to her husband about religion, for it would end any chance of friendship. However, when the new Bible arrived, the brother offered it to his neighbor, who accepted it but would not accept any other Bible literature. He was so surprised at seeing the name Jehovah in the Bible that he searched out information on God’s name in historical books. When these confirmed that God’s name is Jehovah, he decided he had better find out why Jehovah’s witnesses were the only ones proclaiming the name. A home Bible study was started and he has since dedicated his life to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effort to help those who were formerly associated with the organization has been richly rewarded. A circuit servant visited a sister who had not associated with the congregation for some time, and she immediately began to enumerate her problems. Instead of criticizing her for not being at the meetings, the brother used his Bible to show her that the very thing she needed was association with the brothers in order to keep strong spiritually and be able to apply God’s Word to her problems. On his next visit to the congregation this sister was one of the first to greet him at the meeting, happily telling him of the two home Bible studies she was now conducting to help others. Another circuit servant wrote of visiting a family that had been inactive for twelve years and holding a Bible discussion with them, pointing out the importance of family study and service, and helping them to make a schedule of activity. When he returned four months later, all six members of the family were active in the service and studies had been started with three different families of relatives. In a third case it was necessary to start a home Bible study with a couple that had drifted away from the organization several years before, and now these two are active in preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year forty-six new groups were organized in isolated territory, many by special and regular pioneers. One special pioneer couple report that, after working a short time in an isolated territory, fourteen interested persons accompanied them to a circuit assembly, and they say: “This will not be isolated territory much longer, for we will soon have a congregation here.” At one assembly a man related the first contact he had with the truth in 1940 when his family subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> About once a year a publisher passed through that isolated section, but this man and his wife, along with their scattered neighbors, had built a Methodist church and continued to attend there. Not long ago a group of Witnesses was organized about ten miles away at the nearest village, and this couple heard of the coming visit of the circuit servant. With another couple they went to the village to hear the talk, asked many questions, and were convinced they had found the truth. They returned home and began studying and talking to others and soon all were in agreement that the church should be turned into a Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the cities, too, it is sometimes possible to serve where the need is great. A servant in a large congregation asked the circuit servant where he might be of help in isolated territory. The circuit servant recommended that he move to another section of the same city where there were no publishers. The brother moved his family there even though it meant he would have to walk about two hours every day to and from his secular work. He and his family began door-to-door activity and invited interested persons to studies. Now there is a congregation of twenty-six publishers in this section, all because this brother wanted to be used where he was most needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;590,140</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 920 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 641</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After two years of good increase the publishers in British Guiana found that progress slackened off quickly during the past twelve months. It is believed that the political situation had a lot to do with it. The people generally were disturbed and it was difficult to get them interested in studying the Bible. In fact, there was a considerable drop in the number of Bible studies that were conducted in British Guiana compared with the previous year. However, those who are dedicated to God are not giving up. By constantly going from house to house and seeking out the interested persons, more Bible studies will be organized, and when the people give Jehovah’s witnesses time to teach them, then those who love righteousness will take a stand for God’s kingdom. Here are some very interesting reports from the branch servant on the work in British Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were very happy this year to enroll a new congregation some 250 miles south of Georgetown in the savannahs of British Guiana. The 1964 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> reported that the brother who lives in this place was very discouraged and planning to leave the district because of the lack of interest among the population there. But he and his family stayed on, patiently searching for the sheeplike people, and last February the new congregation was formed and now there are twelve publishers reporting field service regularly. An expensive air trip is necessary for the circuit servant to visit this congregation, but regular visits have been made and the congregation has been greatly strengthened thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again showing the blessings of faithful obedience to Jehovah’s laws is the following experience, which comes as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> conclusion to the one found in our report in the 1965 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> As pointed out there, a Muslim woman got the truth and told her consensual partner he must either marry her or she would leave him, although they had been together for many years. They got married and the sister was baptized. This so impressed her husband that he started studying too, although, as he expressed it, he did not really see the need of getting married, as he and his partner had lived so long together and they never quarreled or had any troubles. But studying God’s Word showed him why he should straighten this matter out. This knowledge, along with other truths, moved him to dedicate himself to Jehovah and he was baptized at our “Word of Truth” Assembly in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other letters we received showed how it is possible to share in praising Jehovah even though problems may prevent us from getting out in the house-to-house work. For example, one young sister told of her unbelieving parents who forbade her to go out preaching. She told her problem to a brother, so he arranged for her to get some names and addresses of interested persons. She wrote them and received replies from some agreeing to have Bible studies by mail. One of the interested persons said she had studied previously with a pioneer who had moved away, and she closed her letter, saying: “I do appreciate your suggestions for studying by mail, and I would like to continue studying the book previously mentioned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even as a ‘‘great crowd of priests” came out of Babylon the Great in the days of the early Christian congregation, so now do some ministers of false religion see the same need. A special pioneer happily writes of his experience in contacting a minister who asked many questions on both doctrinal and organizational matters. Among other things, he was surprised to learn of the voluntary nature of our Christian work, and readily agreed to a Bible study. He soon began attending meetings and sharing in the service and now is a zealous baptized brother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">With a ratio of one publisher to every 287 people in the country, one wonders how Jehovah’s witnesses would ever find anyone who has not heard the truth. A very thorough witness has been given in British Honduras, and the witness continues to be given. Each year more individuals are being baptized, and this shows that they are drawing away from Babylon the Great and are dedicating their lives to Jehovah. British Honduras is a peaceful country and Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people with a peaceful message. Sometimes they have to go quite far to find isolated territory, but people are there just as in any other place in the world. Here are a few interesting experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the emphasis on working in isolated territory during the service year we have had many wonderful experiences in the field. The circuit servant has this to relate on working in isolated territory:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We experienced a very rough trip to an isolated village, spending twenty hours at sea, practically without food, and with most of our clothing, literature and files completely wet. However, the week spent in this territory wonderfully compensated for these disadvantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We landed with nowhere to stay, but it was not long after we had arrived that many offers were given from which to choose. Finally, we stayed in the hurricane shelter. This is a beautiful concrete building, with running water and adequate facilities. It also houses the town board office and the public library. This proved to be the ideal place, in view of the large auditorium in the building, which was also at our disposal. It was unusual for the mayor to hand us all the keys to the building free of charge. In appreciation, he was given a thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God and was presented with a free copy of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We were able to cover the territory during the week and found some interest. We managed to place six bound books, about a hundred magazines and obtained six subscriptions. One public lecture was given with twenty-one in attendance. Three studies were stai ted and arrangements were made to continue these by correspondence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being persistent in a study sometimes brings good results. The enjoyment of seeing those studied with attend meetings and take an active part is very encouraging. A pioneer has this to relate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One day a call was made on a man who had shown interest before. On this call I managed to place the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font5"> and arrangements were made for a study. From the very first I made a definite effort to invite the wife to attend the study, but she objected with the words, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses have the last religion in the world I would ever listen to.’ This, of course, did not discourage me and I kept on inviting her. One day she told me that we have a different Bible. Proofs were set forth showing the contrary, but she refused to accept them. This woman is a Catholic, and for the next study her husband made a special effort to have a Catholic Bible on hand. On this call we began comparing Bibles. Seeing that they were alike, she asked many questions, which were answered from her Bible. Recognizing the truthfulness of the answers, she exclaimed: ‘Do you mean that all these years I was not serving God? Now that we know what is right we will continue to work toward that goal!’ From this study onward she made rapid progress. After each study an effort was made to direct their interest to the organization. Meetings were mentioned time and again, and she soon inquired if she could attend. How happy she was to learn that they were not only for the Witnesses. From the first meeting she attended, rain or shine she has not missed a single one. It is indeed a pleasure to hear her commenting at the meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 54,218,549</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 52,615 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,031</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Word of Truth” Assembly at Edinburgh, Scotland, was the first international assembly held in Scotland for thirty years. The Scottish brothers threw themselves wholeheartedly into the preparations that had to be made to accommodate such a great crowd. All who attended this assembly were very grateful to receive the new publication </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </span><span class="font6">The demand for it since its release has been very great. During the first three months after its release the London office shipped out 160,000 copies to the congregations. The big problem in Britain is the falling away on the part of those who at one time had been associated with Jehovah’s organization, and the branch servant gives us some very thoughtful points to ponder over on this matter. He also reports on Aden and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lot of good work has been done during the year aiding the thousands who have fallen into inactivity. This remains one of our chief problems, and much of the progress made during the year in finding new publishers was cancelled out by the many that fell away into inactivity. In considering the many reasons given for this, there is no doubt that with many it is the increasing burden of what Jesus called the “anxieties of life,” the problems, the tensions, the frustrations attendant upon the lives of all who have to contend with Satan's system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is called for is real, practical, warmhearted love from all in the congregation. Sometimes it takes years of giving on the part of the brothers before results are seen. One overseer tells us: “Sister----was</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a special pioneer in this circuit for nearly eight years. Five years ago she became inactive, married out of the truth and now has two children. Although she moved away, I went to visit her every few months from 1962 onwards. The reception was always cold; there did not seem to be a spark of interest. However, I persisted in visiting her, and in January this year it was evident that a change had taken place in her attitude. She came to the public lecture the same day and over the succeeding weeks began to gain spiritual strength. I asked her for her own comments on her change of attitude. She replied that the visits I had made over the last few years made her realise that Jehovah and his people really cared. Just before my visit in January she had prayed to Jehovah for the first time in years to find her way back into his favour. Due to her revived interest a study is now being held with her husband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another sister tells us how she returned to Jehovah after six years in the old system of things: “My husband had been ill and I took full-time employment, although I realise I did not really need to do this. We fell right away and in the first five years saw very few of the brothers. I was glad, because I did not really want to see them. One event which upset me. was when I heard of the death of a sister in the congregation. I had taken this sister in the field service with me and liked her very much. It was in my heart to go to her funeral but I thought it best to leave well enough alone. Soon after this I became sick of the world and its lack of anything spiritual. My children seemed to grow more selfish every day and I was concerned about the lack of spirituality in the home. One bitterly cold morning in February two sisters called in house-to-house work. They looked very cold but stood talking to me a few minutes at the door. When they had gone my brother-in-law looked in for a moment and, seeing the magazines I had taken, began to jeer about the Witnesses, but this only served to show in a wonderful way the difference between God’s people and people of the world. A few days later I met the sister of the one who died and was able to tell her how I felt. She arranged for me to go along to the next public talk, but at the last minute I could not face up to meeting the brothers. During the next few months I seemed to bump into brothers everywhere, on the bus, in the street, while out shopping. I had never seen so many in so short a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Finally, I prayed for the first time in years to Jehovah to give me a little courage to go down to the Kingdom Hall, and on July 26 my sons and I eventually made it. The brothers were wonderful. They went out of their way to welcome us back, and that day became the highlight of our year. It was almost too much to take in one day, and I was very moved by it.” Notice many of the features of the illustration of the “prodigal son.” The desire for worldly things, the eventual reduction to spiritual destitution, the heart’s cry to Jehovah, the return “home,” and the warm welcome. Many fine experiences, too numerous to relate, have been enjoyed in visiting inactive ones with the issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on this grand subject. Much more of this work is needed in the British field with persistence even over years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although there has been a slight drop in magazine distribution, much good work has been done especially by those who persist in building magazine routes. One brother reports: “Twice a month for two years I knocked on the same door on my magazine route, the door opened a few inches, the magazines were taken in and the money passed out and the door closed again. I wondered what I was achieving. But due to a distant assembly I omitted to call. When I did call with the following issues, the door opened much wider and I was met with a complaint about the missing issues! Then I was asked to call back for a chat and questions were asked. I started a study, the interested one began attending meetings and is now out in field service. So if you have a magazine route call like this, don’t give up calling.” There is room for much greater magazine distribution in Britain. One deaf-mute brother placed over a thousand magazines in six months. This shows you do not have to talk much to place magazines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It really is thrilling to see the joy expresssed by those who are released from Babylon the Great and the great zeal they show when they see the wonderful light of Jehovah’s truth. A brother gives us this experience from Northern Ireland: “I was calling back on ‘not homes’ and met a Catholic man. We had quite a long discussion and I arranged to call back. After several visits and some long discussions, he expressed his desire to come to the meetings. He came along for a week or two and then decided he wanted to start publishing, all within six weeks of the first visit. In his first month in the service he reported twenty-five hours and fifteen back-calls and he has now started studies with eight members of his family, as well as his own six children and their children. As a result of this about ten adults and twenty-seven children are coming to a knowledge of the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 31,429</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work has diminished in Aden during the year because the majority of the brothers have left. Our problem in Aden is that we have none of the local population in the truth. All the publishers are temporary residents who have work contracts that eventually expire, and so they have to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the group was visited by the zone servant and the circuit servant, and on the latter occasion the latest film of the Society was shown to an audience of twenty-five, including many of the local people. This shows that there are interested persons in Aden as anywhere else. Magazine work has been done for some months among the local inhabitants, and it is hoped that some of the interest found can be cultivated so that something permanent can be built up. Two more publishers will have left by the time this report is published, leaving just two publishers in Aden. We hope that in the coming months others will be able to move into Aden and bring the Kingdom message to thousands who have not yet heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 14,348</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Malta has gone ahead very well during the year. Not only has the number of publishers increased but the brothers have made good progress toward maturity. They have really appreciated the help of the pioneers and publishers from Britain who have been able to work with them. Another great blessing has been regular visits by the circuit servant from Italy, and a good training work has been accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a wealth of interest in the Kingdom message among the Maltese, as shown by the excellent attendance of forty-two at Memorial. We were also fortunate in being able to show the Society’s latest film to seventy-five. The congregation servant tells us that the film showing made a big impression on those who attended and who were aided to get a better appreciation of the scope of Jehovah’s organization today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In July the brothers got a real thrill when fourteen were able to travel to Sicily for the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Catania. The Italian brothers showed them the greatest kindness, which they greatly appreciated, and one of the Maltese brothers was immersed at the assembly. It is expected that several more will be immersed in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BURMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 24,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 270 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 88,889</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Burma has had a good increase of publishers during the past year despite the fact that the country is largely Buddhist. One of the reported reasons for the increase is that brothers attend circuit assemblies and are made very strong in the truth. By not forsaking the house of their God they are built up spiritually. Even though there are very few persons who believe in Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus, their spiritual strength must be taken care of by going to meetings and associating one with the other. They also take the Word of God to others by going from house to house. The branch servant gives us a few interesting experiences that have taken place in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The arrangement of the Society for reviving “dead” publishers has brought us fine results, as shown by the following experience: “While checking Publisher’s Record cards during his visit, a circuit servant found two inactive publishers. On the set night, Wednesday, the circuit and the congregation servants visited them. To revive their interest, a sermon was given to the whole family along with some Hindoo neighbors. A group study was arranged and good progress was made. The next visit of the circuit servant found not only the two inactive publishers revived, but the parents of these two, and three persons from the next house, previously Hindoos, also active publishers. The congregation servant related how they had destroyed their images, which were used for phallic worship. The only image left was a picture of Jesus that they worshiped. They asked if that also must be destroyed. The overseer nodded his head and it went the way of the others. Even two nearby families, also Hindoos, accepted the truth. So, by their being mindful of the importance of reviving inactive ones, the truth has been accepted by four families. This means two inactive ones revived and eight others, six of whom though formerly Hindoos, are now in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may have trouble bringing others in the household into our home Bible study, but at times it really pays. Here is a letter showing this fact: “A young schoolboy was invited to join in the home Bible study of a pioneer brother, but he refused to do so because</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">he had no faith in God. However, after several invitations he reluctantly complied with the brother’s wishes. At first he was not interested, but after a number of studies he began to recognize the ring of truth, so much so that he set aside his schoolbooks to study the Watch Tower publications. He tried to witness to his father, who lived in a village a few miles away, but the message had no appeal. In fact, his father threw a spear at him for exposing some of his false teachings. Since then the father takes no interest in him. Letters that the boy wrote to him were returned unopened. The lady with whom he was staying began to show a dislike for the truth when she realized that the boy was really serious, and was forsaking his father’s religion, Buddhism, for a ‘Western’ religion. Her hatred for the truth became so intense that she drove him out of her house, and, not wishing to impose upon his brothers, he walked the streets till nightfall. Fortunately for him, he met the pioneer, who was on his way home from a late call. He asked the boy what he was doing and, after some questioning, the boy related the events of the day. Thereafter, the brother took him home and seized the opportunity to continue the home Bible study with him. To the joy of this brother, the boy symbolized his dedication at a recent circuit assembly.” So always be alert to invite others of the household to join in your home Bible study, as this pioneer did.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Cameroun are making a bold stand for the truth and they want to be solid in the faith, because they know that “the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of . . . brothers in the world.” (1 Pet. 5:9) They know that they must press on to maturity and meet with God’s people regularly and maintain clean worship. The branch servant in Cameroun looks after the work in that country and in Tchad. Here are a few experiences from each place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” has greatly helped sincere persons to come out of Babylon the Great before her complete destruction. A Protestant woman attended a showing of the film at a circuit assembly and was deeply impressed by what she saw and heard. Early next morning, Sunday, she called on the congregation overseer at his home and declared that she wanted to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. “Up to now, I have only wasted my time and money with my minister,” she explained. “What I have seen in the film has convinced me that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth.” Her husband had followed her to the home of the overseer and threatened her severely, saying she had gone out of her mind. However, the woman replied that, whatever happens, she knows where the truth is and will not fail to attend our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a territory where there were many illiterate citizens, the district servant overcame this problem by directing the publishers’ efforts in magazine placements toward the more educated centers, such as the business sections and the market stalls. He emphasized short, 30- to 60-second presentations. Before a group of eight publishers, he demonstrated how to do this. As a result, in a morning’s service, the group of eight placed fifty-three magazines. That was more than three times the number this group usually placed in a whole month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One man who has now come to appreciate the extensive teaching and training work accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses was moved to write an expression of his joy: “I have the greatest pleasure in sending you this donation in order to help you in the many features of Kingdom service. I have known the ‘truth’ for just a short time. I have been engaged in preaching for just three months; my wife for the past eleven months. She is now baptized. I have learned many wonderful things in Jehovah’s organization and I pray that He will continually help me to know more about His will in order that I might serve Him in all seriousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TCHAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 168,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to the present the preaching of the “good news of the kingdom” in Tchad has centered mostly in and around the capital city, Fort Lamy. The majority of the publishers are from surrounding African countries and have come to Fort Lamy for secular employment. However, local citizens are now paying attention to the “good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While calling from house to house, one brother reports meeting a native Tchadian who expressed appreciation for the Kingdom message and then confided that he was troubled by evil spirits. During the second world war a friend had given him a magical object. He had long lost this magical object, but the spirits kept troubling him. He could not sleep at night. He consulted a Catholic priest, who told him to bring the object to him and to give him the address of the donor, which the man was unable to do. No help there! Next, he went to see a Moslem “holy man,” who instructed him to bring a large white sheep and two red-and-white chickens. Still no satisfaction! Could the Witness help him? “Well,” said the Witness, “perhaps not personally, but I worship a God whom the spirits fear very much. If you study his Word, I am confident </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> will help you.” The troubled man agreed to a study. When the Witness returned for the second study, the man happily reported that he had slept well during the week. After the third and fourth studies, he announced that the spirits were no longer troubling him. He inquired about the Witnesses’ meeting place. The brother directed him to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, where he regularly attends Bible meetings, arriving well ahead of time. Now he is arranging to have his marriage meet the legal and Scriptural requirements in order to have an active share in teaching others about the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 19,058,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 41,887 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 455</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses again had a very fine opportunity to preach the good news of the Kingdom in Canada, but it is interesting to note that the growth in population is moving ahead faster than the growth of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. Even though in Canada many new congregations are being started among the Italianspeaking people who are immigrating in great numbers to Canada, last year Canada had one publisher for every 450 persons, but this year they have one publisher for every 455. If the brothers in Canada are going to keep up with the increase in population so as to keep the same ratio that they have had in former years, they will have to help those who are already in the truth to stay in it and to see the importance of attending meetings and gaining maturity. They will have to realize the importance, too, of continuing to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom along with the new ones constantly coming to a knowledge of the truth. During the past five years more than 8,000 persons in Canada have been baptized, but during these same five years there has been an increase of only 4,690 publishers. So there must be quite a number of brothers and sisters who are not keeping their spiritual strength. However, those who are active are having a grand time. They spent more time in the field service last year than ever before. Their magazine distribution has increased and those faithfully proclaiming the good news are having the joy in the ministry. Here are a few experiences that the branch servant sends in telling what has happened in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The invitation for many more to enter the vacation pioneer service during the summer months got a wonderful response. How glad we were to see our previous peak of vacation pioneers bettered by more than eleven hundred! And the volunteers came from all ages and circumstances. One sister, crippled and confined to a wheelchair, decided she was going to take up the invitation. She wrote letters to residents of restricted apartment buildings, she went out on the street corner and along the beach in the coastal town where she lives, and she used the telephone effectively. The results for her month of pioneering: 75 hours, 102 magazines, 24 back-calls and one Bible study. She now has a magazine route, which includes the laundromat, the self-service dry-cleaning store, and so forth. “If I had not made the effort,” she says, “I would have missed out on many wonderful experiences.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another handicapped publisher, now twenty years old, has had cerebral palsy since birth and is also confined to a wheelchair. Though his speech is not very intelligible, his typewriting is, and here is what he has to say about himself: “I consider myself quite fortunate. I have been able to share regularly in Jehovah’s service, starting with a few hours a month and gradually increasing to fifteen hours. I was fourteen years old when I came back home after spending seven months at the Rehabilitation Center where they taught me how to type with one finger. Then I began typing letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since I graduated from school this summer I’ve doubled my service time, and am now striving for thirty hours a month. My back-calls are increasing and I have one very interesting Bible study that I conduct by mail. This month (November 1964) I will be vacation pioneering, typing letters to relatives and friends, as well as drawing upon the local press and the phone books for names. With Jehovah’s help I plan to vacation pioneer a few months every year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While some handicapped persons feel that they cannot possibly enjoy many of the privileges of the Christian congregation, there are others who have no such idea. In one western congregation there are seven deaf-mutes who are dedicated and regularly attend all meetings. They share in all ministerial activities, three of them even conducting studies with other deaf persons. They use a typewritten card to introduce themselves both in house-to-house and in street-corner witnessing. They approach people who are waiting for the bus or window-shopping, and sometimes approach people waiting in queues at the movie houses. One of the younger sisters has placed as many as forty magazines in one hour. During a three-month period she averaged seventy magazines a month. AH seven are in the Theocratic Ministry School and do well in their assignments. While they give their talks in sign language, someone translates for the benefit of the congregation. Everyone is most attentive when the deaf sign their talks because they put so much expression and feeling into the signing. Those without a handicap are surely encouraged to share fully in the fine training provided by the school sessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the circuit servants reports that he has just completed his fifth visit to congregations in his new circuit and has found that the brothers have been placing, on the average, twenty-five copies of the new book during the five service days of each visit. A brother in the West joyously reported the following: “Having received the new consignment of books following our assembly we were enthusiastic about the early distribution of this treasure to the public. Our Bible studies came first, of course. Having completed two studies that I had scheduled for a Thursday afternoon, and after placing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font5"> book at each of them, I decided to call on two ‘not homes’ while waiting for the rest of the group. At one of these calls I met a young widowed woman whose husband had died just three weeks before and who showed a great deal of interest in the Bible’s promises for the future and accepted a copy of the new book, particularly because of its comforting explanation of the resurrection hope. A neighbor lady washing clothes just a short distance away was hailed by this excited young woman and a second book was placed when she came over to see what it was all about. An old gentleman from upstairs now put in his appearance. He could not sleep and wondered also what the excitement was about. His inquisitiveness is now being rewarded as he reads the third book I placed at that one visit. Three books in one visit, five for the afternoon, and I am still convinced that the book placed itself! We give thanks to Jehovah for this added equipment so that many more may be helped to see the light of truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL, AFRICAN REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 748 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,800,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,406</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has been a year of growth for Jehovah’s witnesses in the Central African Republic. Not only have more people associated with the organization, but many of those with the organization have grown to maturity. The brothers appointed as overseers have taken it upon themselves to carry out the responsibilities that go with the various offices. This has helped the theocratic organization. Literacy classes have also been in operation in this territory and many adults have now learned to read. This, of course, is a great advantage to everyone because each one can do his own studying and make better expression at the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">meetings. A new branch office and missionary home is now in course of construction. This in itself has given stimulus to the work, as the brothers know the Society is there to stay. Here are some experiences that the branch servant sends in,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following counsel given in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font5"> a circuit servant presented a young boy at the door as a student minister. One old man thought it was quite a young age to be a student minister, as the boy was only five years old. But when the boy gave a simplified sermon about God’s promise of a new system of things, the man really listened and even called his own children over to listen to the young boy who knew what he was talking about. The result was a study with the old man and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A splendid witness was given during the district assembly that was held out in the open beside the Kingdom Hall. While a brother was giving the discourse on “Jerusalem—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Burdensome Stone” the evening of the second day, a sudden, unexpected, out-ofseason tornado swept through the city followed by torrential rain. Under such circumstances any other organization would close up and the people would make a beeline for their homes. But our brothers just crowded into the Kingdom Hall and applauded as the fine points of this prophecy were brought out. The neighbors were much surprised when the storm ended and they still heard the loudspeaker and the brothers applauding at the Kingdom Hall. This opened a door for a witness in that area as the people realized that Jehovah’s witnesses take their religion seriously and would not miss one of the talks at the assembly, even when </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">tornado ripped roofs from buildings all over the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer minister engaged in the house-to-house ministry gave the sermon to a family of several members, but they walked out one by one until only a twelve-year-old girl remained. She liked what she heard. A Bible study was begun on the return call and in a short while she was coming to all the meetings and then became a regular publisher of God’s kingdom. The other members of the family did everything they could to discourage her, even resorting to physical violence, but to no avail; she was determined to serve Jehovah. She wanted the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, but where would the money come from? Finally, she decided to make a sweet beverage and sell it to passersby. In a few weeks she owned a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, then a Bible, then a book bag, then a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription. In spite of her youth and the continued opposition from her family, she is a real encouragement to the local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CEYLON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 255 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 43,725</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the second year in a row there has been no increase in the average number of Jehovah’s witnesses preaching the good news in Ceylon. While there have been new persons dedicating themselves to the doing of God’s will, there have been an equal number of disfellowshipings. As long as there is bad conduct or uncleanness in an organization, it will definitely slow down the work of those trying to do the right thing. It is much better to keep the organization clean so that those who come in will grow to maturity and appreciate their responsibilities before God. The brothers who are zealously pressing on with the work are having many interesting experiences in Ceylon, and here are a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two months ago while at the home of a lady with whom my wife conducts a study I was able to meet the lady’s brother, who is an apothecary working some 200 miles away. He quizzed us for about two hours on the trinity, immortality of the soul, hell, the cross and the clergy-laity distinction. We carefully answered from God’s Word and he confessed, “This is the truth.” He subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and took the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. The next day he came to the missionary home and, after a long discussion on the organization, obtained a Bible and four more books. A study was arranged by letter and soon the answers to the questions came pouring in. He was quick to grasp many of the basic teachings. After some time I went to visit him and after two long studies took him out in the service. He has taken down all images and started four home Bible studies of his own. He spends each evening from 4:30 on till late in the night either discussing the Bible with others or studying himself. He now plans to attend the “Word of Truth” Assembly and symbolize his dedication by baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four members of my husband’s family were inactive for about seven years. As a special pioneer I was sent to the city where they live. I began to assist them in a progressive manner. At first there was opposition, so I decided to invite some of them to my home for a Bible study. They began to make progress and in time, with my husband’s aid, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5"> invited them to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. I am happy to report that these once inactive ones together with three other members of the family now share in the Christian ministry. Aiding inactive ones to become active again is thrilling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through correspondence I learned the truth. Being a Roman Catholic, I was studying at a convent. My hobby was writing to Catholic pen pals. One in New Delhi, India, told me shortly after I started writing to him in 1956 that his father had changed his religion and how sad they were. He had become a Witness, I learned later. I said I would pray for them, and we kept writing and exchanging holy pictures. Exams came and writing slacked off and ceased. In 1963 I wrote to him again and his reply was a sermon and all the things he had learned at the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Delhi, at which he was baptized. He was now one of Jehovah’s witnesses. My first thought was to forget him, but then I thought I could help him see his big mistake. But it turned out the other way, as he always answered my questions from the Douay Bible, but his on trinity, hell and repetitious prayers I was unable to answer in spite of winning prizes for religious knowledge at school. I was stumped. I decided to go to Delhi. In time I consented to attend some meetings. How different from the church! Why, everyone was so friendly! A sister started a study with me in May 1964, and I was eager to learn. By July I decided to make </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> dedication to do Jehovah’s will and was baptized. I now enjoy the Christian ministry. How thankful I am to Jehovah for helping me to learn his truth in this unusual way, through a pen pal, now my husband!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,600,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This long strip of land in South America was badly hit by the elements during the past year. There was an earthquake in March and devastating storms in August. Both of these were classified as national disasters. However, Jehovah’s witnesses along with the rest of the people in Chile endured them. God’s servants were undaunted and kept right on doing their assigned work of preaching the “everlasting good news.” They thought of David’s words: “I willingly kept myself concerned with the work of your own hands.” (Ps. 143:5) Our brothers in Chile had a fine year in Kingdom service, ending it with an 8-percent increase. Here are some interesting experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher was able to arrange her affairs to be a regular pioneer, working only half a day in the factory where she has worked for several years and where she is held in high esteem for her attitude and work. In order to do so she had to overcome the objections of her employer, who did not want to lose her full day’s work. Finally, seeing her firm determination to take up the full-time ministry, he agreed to her terms. Imagine her surprise at the end of the first month to find that she received the same salary as when she worked full time! His reply: “If you are going to walk so much in your preaching work, your shoes will wear out faster, so how could you earn less? No. We will pay you the same as before.” Her goal is now special pioneering for January 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned with God’s work at all times, whether actually in the field ministry or not. While making his purchases one day in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> store a publisher overheard a lady say: “For everything there is a remedy, except for death.” He replied: “Do you know, lady, that there is a remedy even for death?” When asked what it was, he briefly explained the hope of the resurrection and life in a new system of things. A back-call was arranged for, and when it was made, the lady obtained a Bible and also the aids </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, and a study was started. As the study continues she is being convinced that there is a remedy for everything, including death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even small children when properly trained at home will also be concerned about proper things. A dedicated sister who operates a beauty parlor overheard a conversation between her seven-year-old niece and a playmate. The playmate explained that she would not be able to play the next day since she was going to church, to which the niece said she would be going to the Kingdom Hall to learn more of Jehovah’s purposes. The playmate asked: “Who is Jehovah? I’ve never heard of him.” The child ran and got her Bible and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sanctified</span><span class="font5"> book and showed her some texts using God’s name, at which the playmate took the books to show to her father. Meanwhile the others in the parlor commented on what had been said and the aunt continued the discussion where the child left off. She was able to place three books and ten magazines and arrange for two Bible studies. When this same child was sent to school, the aunt accompanied her to request that she be exempted from the classes in religion. The school director agreed but said that, since she was the only one exempted and there was no other place in the school for her to go during the classes, she would have to sit in the classroom without participating. This was agreed to. When the class began, the religious instructor began to speak of Mary “the mother of God,” and the child raised her hand and explained that Mary was the mother of Jesus and that Jehovah had no mother. As a result, from then on she was not allowed to participate but, rather, she was given candies to keep her quiet. However, in the recesses after the religious classes she would continue to explain the truth to her playmates, showing them the errors taught in the religious sessions. One day the mother of one of the classmates went to the publisher’s home and asked for more information, saying that her child had been telling her what she was learning from her playmate during the recesses. Consequently a regular home Bible study was started. Parents, are you sharing in Jehovah’s goodness by teaching the truth to your children at an early age?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This is a very interesting country. The Catholic church has certain strongholds and the Liberals have their strongholds. But regardless of who is in charge of the political situation, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to preach the good news. They preach in favorable season and in troublesome circumstances, and the experiences the brothers have are very heartwarming. Good progress has been made in Colombia during the past service year and, as far as hours spent in the field service are concerned, this has been the best year to date. Here are some of the experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young married man was a strong Communist and was scheduled to be sent to Moscow for advanced training in the politics of the party for future use in Colombia. His wife, a strong Catholic, was trying everything to get him to drop his Communist activity. However, what he had seen in the state religion had been sufficient to turn him to communism for a better hope in the first place. One day his wife obtained the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. He read them and liked what he read, but still he was skeptical. The Witness returned and discussions were held. The man showed much interest but not the wife, who felt that it was different from her religion. As time went on she could see the change in her husband, so she too began to investigate. A regular study was started with the family. Still the man was a staff writer for the Communist journal in Bogota and had written many articles for them. Now what would he do? He was assigned to write an article and to include the statement: “There is no God.” This he could not do, and when they insisted, he refused to write the article. He also refused to go out at night and write slogans on walls against the government, saying that he felt communism was a good thing for the people, but why sneak about at night and do things in the dark? It would be better to tell the people about it in a teaching program. He gave up writing for them and later rejected the Communist movement altogether. He began attending all the Kingdom Hall meetings and enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School and started out in the service. Both he and his wife were baptized and he now conducts three home Bible studies. How happy he is! Often he expresses his gratefulness to Jehovah for sending someone to him to show him the true hope that he had been seeking all his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer was studying with a devout Catholic woman whose home bristled with religious objects, to the point that her son told her if anything shook the house they would all be killed by the falling images. While this woman was studying, the film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” was shown and she attended, but upon seeing the part about images she became angry and stalked out and then discontinued her Bible study. Then one day the same sister called, accompanied by the circuit servant. They received a warm welcome. The woman had had time to think things over and had realized how foolish she had been, admitting to herself that what she had seen was the truth. The study was resumed and she started attending meetings regularly. To the surprise of her neighbors, she made a large pile of her images and religious relics and burned them. She began going out in the field service and was baptized in May. She took up vacation pioneering for July and August and requested an extension through December. Her goal is to be a regular pioneer. She already conducts four home Bible studies with her neighbors, and her appreciation of the truth is a blessing to behold.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark103"></a>The month of April proved to be a very happy month in the history of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Congo. This was due to the fact that so many of the publishers enrolled as vacation pioneers. In fact, 18 percent of the total publishers reported that month as vacation pioneers or other full-time servants. This proved to be a wonderful training period for the publishers. It gave them experience and training that was useful for the rest of the year. Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed a 12-percent increase in the Congo during the 1965 service year. The branch servant in Brazzaville sent in some good experiences for the Congo Republic and the Republic of Gabon.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Many of us have certain roads or sections of our territory that we hesitate to work. Why? Because everybody there has refused us or has outright opposed us. That was the way our brothers in the bush felt every time they traveled to a certain village to witness, only to be chased out by the chief and the common folk. They thought, Was it worth the five-mile hike over a mountainous path, they and their seven small children with them, just to receive a cold rebuff? One day they found their efforts were blessed by finding an interested man hidden among all the opposers. Perseverance brought great joy to them and even greater happiness to this nearly 100-year-old man. In his long life he had had many problems, not the least of which was a disease he had had for forty years without finding a cure, though seeking medical and religious help. At times he thought death would be kind, and longed for it. Having examined the falseness of many religions, including the tribal one of his own village, he despaired of ever finding the true one, until the day our brothers found him. The ensuing Bible studies were a soothing spiritual balm to him. Now he cherishes the hope of spiritual as well as physical healing in God’s righteous new order of things soon to come. During the circuit servant’s visit a public talk was given at the truth seeker’s home. After the discourse the aged man explained to the circuit servant: “The other villagers say that yours is a new religion and all others came here and worked long before you. To them I say it is like the market—the poorer grade of merchandise comes out first and is bought up quickly because people think that is all there is to be had. Well, when the good merchandise is brought in, most persons have no interest in it, having already spent their money for the things of inferior quality. Many false religions have preceded Jehovah’s witnesses, but now the real truth is here, thanks to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four little children, ranging from five and a half to two years old, organized imaginary meetings in their backyard. These meetings were conducted for the benefit of their neighborhood playmates. They organized and conducted the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting. They presented demonstrations and the sermon. All four Witness children were of preschool age and none were able to read or write. The four-and-a-half-year-old boy was the chairman. A four-year-old gave a talk on “Who Is Jehovah?” Of course, the meeting began with a song. The four children sang with songbooks opened. In the Service Meeting they used the Bible, pretending they were reading from it, to explain to the worldly children how to prepare a sermon. “Jehovah Made the Heavens and the Earth” was the sermon demonstrated. As the little fellow progressed in his demonstration he explained that Jehovah remains in heaven and that Jesus Christ is not God but his Son. At this point a worldly youngster objected. “Jesus is God,” he said. The Witness children explained that Jesus is not God but the Son of God. They cited texts that they heard their parents use. They concluded their meetings with prayer. Afterward, with their parents’ Bibles in hand, they organized the whole group of children to go witnessing. Their householders were the trees in their backyard. These imaginary meetings were conducted for two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What were the results of their efforts? Recently, when the Society’s film was shown at the local Kingdom Hall, many of those children were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 104 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,769</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In January four missionaries arrived in Gabon. What a ripe field for seeds of truth they found! Along with the local brothers, they were able to place much literature during the year. Placements will likely soar even higher during the coming year. The majority of the Gabonese love to read, so they readily accept the publications from the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following experience demonstrates the necessity of keeping right principles before those with whom we study. A missionary wrote: “One afternoon while my wife and I were engaged in door-to-door ministry, a man called to us, saying: ‘Why don’t you come and preach the good news to us?’ We readily accepted the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">invitation and started a Bible study. From the beginning this couple demonstrated a keen interest in the Bible and its righteous principles. After one month they asked to have a home Bible study twice weekly, as they were not progressing fast enough. From the beginning we encouraged meeting attendance, and they readily responded. After two months of study the man asked us when they could join in the preaching activity. At the same time he asked what the requirements were to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. We promptly replied that our organization was not like others, in that we strictly follow Bible principles on morals, right conduct and the need to be legally married. He promptly told us that they had been living together for five months, being married according to tribal custom only and not in a civil ceremony. The very next day he went to the City Hall to make arrangements for a civil ceremony to legalize their marriage. After a month’s required waiting period, they were married legally. As our circuit servant was serving with us, he gave an instructive discourse on marriage on their behalf. After the talk, what do you suppose was the first thing they did? Why, they shared in the magazine distribution, something they had looked forward to for some time. They are both making fine progress and are looking forward to the day when they can be baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO, EEOPOLDVILLE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;13,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In spite of very grave events that occurred in the Congo during the past year Jehovah’s witnesses have remained active, having in mind the words of the year’s text, “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” Only a few years ago Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and thrown into prison quite frequently, but recently the government of the Congo has granted the people of the country greater freedom, and now they are able to carry on their ministry with greater success. Even in these troublesome times it appears that very shortly the brothers will be able to have their first circuit assembly in the land. Despite the difficulties in the country, Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed a 32-percent increase in those proclaiming the good news. Here are some very interesting reports from the branch servant of Leopoldville, Congo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it not wonderful to realize that, despite the rebellion and destruction brought on by the war in the country, God’s people have been able to continue service and worship in peace? It is true that from time to time some of our brothers were in danger of death due to the rebellion as well as from threats of execution, beatings, and so forth, but they maintained their integrity. The loss of life due to the troubles in the country was very small among the brothers. Many continued having their meetings during the troubled moments. At times the enemy falsely charged that the brothers had political meetings, and, on a few occasions, armed men with the intent to kill and destroy were seen approaching the Kingdom Hall, but the meeting did not stop. The brothers continued their song and prayer. The armed men saw that the brothers had nothing to do with politics and left them unharmed. The brothers were assured by these armed men that they were not against religion and God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another time a special pioneer and some publishers of an isolated group were in the midst of a crowd that had been rounded up by the rebels who were seeking some responsible people for public execution. When the special pioneer was asked from which tribe he was, the brother replied bravely, “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” Surprised, the one questioning demanded, “Who are Jehovah’s witnesses?” The brother took advantage of this occasion to give a witness. Finally the man said: “If all people were like you, there would be no more war.” Then he asked again: “Are there others of Jehovah’s witnesses here? If there are, show them to me.” So the special pioneer and the other brothers were told to go back to their homes and were spared. It is evident that the brothers did well not to fear those that can kill the body but not the soul. There is no doubt that Jehovah was a source of strength for these brothers under such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The legal battles have cost much money during the year, but we thank Jehovah for the results obtained. A detailed study on the question of the “Kitawala” (groups which take on this name and identify their meeting places with the name Kitawala, Watch Tower, International Bible Students Association, and Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania) was prepared by the branch and submitted to officials of the Central Government as well as all the provincial governments where problems in this connection arose. This enabled the authorities in many cases to see the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and those who have been falsely using the name of the Society. The circuit servants that work in territories where this problem of the “Kitawala” is prevalent were also sent copies of the report and documents and were able to put these to good use in their contact with the officials. It has happened in cases where all the brothers in a village have been arrested because the authorities confused them with the “Kitawala,” that, after the branch sent a copy of this detailed study and the documents to the authorities, the next day the brothers were freed and given the right to preach and to build a Kingdom Hall in the locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,386,737</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,781 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 499</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Costa Rica have enjoyed another year of service. There were 151 persons baptized during the past year. There was no increase in the number of publishers in the organization though. We might say it stood still. This is because of the number of disfellowshipings that took place. The congregations are anxious to keep Jehovah’s organization clean for pure worship, and when people try to bring immoral habits along with them into God’s organization and among God’s dedicated people, they have to be removed. The inhabitants of Costa Rica are getting a fine witness. The territory is well covered, and here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago an interested person received a subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and attended some meetings. Later he became involved in some illegal activities and was sent to prison. His interest in the truth grew and he wrote to the Society for some help. Visits were made by a missionary for about one year, and after much study the man became a publisher, witnessing to those in the prison. He was assigned to a penal island for prisoners being rehabilitated and has used the time to become stronger in the truth. Arrangements were made through him to show the film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” to the inmates of the prison. A group of seven brothers visited the island, and the film was shown to 175 prisoners, many of whom expressed much appreciation for the information. One said: “Many have come here and shown pictures, but this is the first time that someone came with something upbuilding and instructive.” One hundred and ninety-eight books were given away free to the prisoners, and arrangements were made for the publisher to conduct some Bible studies. The officials asked if some Bible talks could be given, and arrangements are being made to do this in the future. And what of the publisher? He has expressed his desire to be baptized and, although he has a few years of his sentence remaining, he is cheerful. He mentioned to some brothers: “Some consider this a hard experience; this is a prison to them. But to me it is an opportunity to learn the truth so that, when I get out, I can be a good minister.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After many visits by Jehovah’s witnesses an interested man agreed to have a home Bible study. Since he is a motorman for a railroad and is on call to drive personnel for a large fruit company up and down the lines, he had to have his study very early in the morning. The brother who studied with him would wake up at 4 a.m. so he could be on time for the 5 a.m. study. He became very interested and began attending meetings, but, because he was not married to the woman with whom he was living, he could not take an active part in the congregation’s activities. The congregation began to build a new Kingdom Hall, and, since it was only a short way from the railroad tracks, the motorman passed it very often in his work. He became very interested in the hall, looking each time he passed by to see how the work was progressing. He himself donated material and money toward the hall and even made a personal loan so that it could be finished sooner. It seems that this material giving helped him spiritually as well. He decided that he wanted to share in the ministry and symbolize his dedication to Jehovah, but he still had his marital affairs to straighten out. This was partially solved when the woman walked out of the house; she did not like the fact that he was becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses and thought the shock would cure him. When she saw that he was firm in his decision, she returned to the home and agreed to marry him and even accepted a Bible study for herself. The man has become a brother, symbolizing his dedication at a recent assembly one week after being married. His new wife continues to have her own Bible study and attends the meetings with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All are thrilled with the two new books that we have received this year, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose.</span><span class="font5"> Also, we have enjoyed using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> that is now being printed in the Spanish language, and many brothers have asked me to express their thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,068,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 18,078 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 391</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have endured twelve months of hardship in Cuba and they have proved very definitely that they are not “fearful of those who kill the body.” The Society’s magazines, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font6"> cannot be shipped into the country as in former years, but the brothers still enjoy spiritual food because they have the Bible, the Word of God. They study this together in the congregations along with other literature that is available. Even though they do not have very many publications to use in going from house to house, they have not slackened their hand in the slightest. The greatest witness ever given in Cuba was given during the past service year, because the witnesses of Jehovah there spent 3,865,030 hours declaring the good news. This is 750,000 more hours than during the previous year. Persecution, imprisonment and destruction of property have not made them fearful. With opposition from all sides they have still had a 6-percent increase and have helped those wanting to flee from Babylon the Great. It makes one’s heart glad to hear of their faithfulness and devotion. Here are a few experiences from our brothers in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this wonderful work was accomplished, but not without opposition. Hundreds of our brothers were arrested because of the preaching activity, many of them had to pay $100 as bond in order to obtain liberty and, later in the trial, were condemned to pay $25 to $50 fines. Others were condemned to three or four months in prison or at so-called “farms” (camps of forced labor). There are some of our brothers in those places now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another proof of the integrity of our brothers came during this year with the call for obligatory military service. Hundreds of our friends were called. The answer was always the same: “We are neutrals.” As a result of this position, in the provinces of Oriente and Pinar del Rio more than forty of our friends were condemned to one to six years in prison. Ten of those brothers have already been released, but still there are about thirty of them serving terms in prison. In the rest of the country hundreds of our friends were called before military officers, but after one or two interrogations they were permitted to go home, with this advice: “Go to your home and stay there. We will know what to do with you people.” This course of action taken by the majority of the brothers is in contrast with the handful who have compromised and have broken their integrity to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports from those in prison tell how their boldness, integrity and Christian conduct have amazed the officers in charge of the prison. In many cases, our brothers in prisons are in charge of the dining rooms, kitchens, and so forth. Because of the good conduct of these brothers some of them have been able to get permission to see their relatives and stay with them fortyeight hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the legal front many cases were decided in our favor in lower courts and hundreds of our friends were acquitted, but, as mentioned before, many were condemned to prisons and to pay fines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of all this legal battle and persecution for the preaching of the good news, our friends made certain of the words of our Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus: 'Do not be fearful of them.’ Their average of hours during the year, which came to more than twelve per publisher, gave proof of their zeal, as did some of then experiences in the field service. In the newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">El Mundo,</span><span class="font5"> in the column &quot;Evangelical World” written by the “Rev.” Raul Fernandez Ceballos, there appeared on some occasions slanderous articles against Jehovah’s witnesses. A brother, when working from house to house, talked with a person who read one of these articles. She told the brother: “I think more about Jehovah’s witnesses after the publication of one of these articles than ever before. I hate the way this writer spoke about your people. I was amazed at the way you teach the Bible and how the Witnesses do not speak evil of any person.” After she read that article she started to attend the nearest Kingdom Hall and to study the Bible with the brother. Later she said: “The main reason I started to study with the Witnesses was that, as Jesus prophesied, Jehovah’s witnesses are the targets of everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That knowledge of the truth changes the lives of persons is shown in this experience: A person came to a knowledge of the truth and found that a great decision had to be made. Years before, he had killed a man in a fight. He was condemned to prison, but during the revolution the doors of the prison were opened, and since then he had been a fugitive from justice. Now after knowing the truth he understood that he could not serve Jehovah and at the same time be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">fugitive. So he went to the authorities and surrendered himself. After some time, because of his good conduct, he was liberated and is now a man free to serve his God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the truth is what we always have to speak (Zech. 8:16) is shown in the following experience: A brother working from house to house found a woman in great tribulation; her son was in jail awaiting trial, and the prosecutor was asking the death penalty for him because of activities against the government. The brother told her that the real comfort was in the Bible, and after his giving the sermon a home Bible study was started with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet. The next week, during the night, the woman came to the house of the brother and left a message with his wife telling him to come to her home any time that night. The brother got home at eleven o’clock that night, but after receiving the message he went to the home of the troubled mother. He found her weeping because the trial was being held that same night and she was afraid her son would be condemned to death. She told the brother: “Please, pray to your God that my son will not be killed.” The brother lovingly explained to her that in these days there are no such miracles, and that even servants of Jehovah have to die as the apostles of Christ Jesus died. Then the brother explained to her about the arrangements that God would make in his new order for the resurrected ones, and that since God’s Son died for us, then she, and her daughter who was also present, must study the Bible in order to know the purposes of Jehovah in the new order of things by means of him. The brother explained that he would be pleased to pray to God in order for them to get an understanding of his Word the Bible. They accepted, and a prayer was offered, asking the favor of God for them in their study of his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next week the brother came to conduct the home Bible study. He knew that the son of the woman had been executed and he wondered what her reaction and that of her daughter would be. They received him with a smile on their faces, even though they were still very distressed, and before the brother could open his lips the woman told him: “Look! I went to a relative the last week and he told me to pray to some saint and my son would not die. Two spiritists told me that if I prayed to God my son would not die, but you were the only ones who told me the truth and explained the purpose of Jehovah about the resurrection hope. Let me know more about that.” After a few months she attended the Memorial and participated in the field service, giving to others the “word of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;550,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 424 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,297</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a great exodus from the island of Cyprus. Over one hundred witnesses of Jehovah found it advisable to leave the island. Work has been difficult to find because of the unsettled future. The internal conditions have made it impossible for some to remain there. The whole island has become, to a large extent, a military organization. Despite this, however, the island of Cyprus received a good witness by those remaining. Some of the territory is worked every three weeks, and, of course, at different seasons of the year the Witnesses are able to get out into the rural areas to witness. The faithfulness of God’s ministers on the island has resulted in more persons’ discussing the name of Jehovah in their homes, either favorably or unfavorably. At times there are physical attacks upon the Witnesses by foot, fist or stone. A number of these occurrences have taken place in small villages. One of the outstanding points in the report from Cyprus is that meeting attendance figures show 100 percent of the publishers are at the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study. They are not neglecting the house of their God. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said, “Let your light shine.” Christian families living in harmony with Bible principles are a powerful means to direct interested persons into the organization when people in localities where we live are not prone to listen at all to the message. A certain section of the capital city was difficult to witness to and the seed of truth had not taken root. A family of Jehovah’s witnesses eventually settled in this area by renting a house from a landlady who planned to live in a small house behind them. The landlady advised the family, “I know what you are, but there is no need to preach to me.” However, very soon the neighbors living round about started complaining that this family was not wanted in the area. The landlady was soon involved and persecuted along with the family. The stonings by day and the snakes put outside the doors by night to frighten the family away when they returned from their congregational meetings, together with shouting and bad language by various neighbors, had a telling effect on the landlady. Even the local priest visited the landlady and demanded that she have this family leave or else real force would be brought to bear. This landlady could now see who was letting their light shine. She could see who were ‘peacemakers’ and who were ‘peacebreakers.’ Once, the police were called to quell the parishioners of the local church and restore order. The family of Jehovah’s witnesses had actually been preaching all this time incidentally to the landlady and ‘letting their light shine.’ A Bible study was actually asked for by the landlady, and by the time you read this experience she will have been baptized, and she has become a very active publisher along with her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A blind man can also declare the good news. After a publisher started a Bible study with a blind man, reading the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book to him each week, excellent progress was made. The blind man, like many others, had an excellent memory for scriptures. He is a zealous publisher of the good news to all he meets. He has the scriptures referring to doctrine and the new order at his fingertips and has refuted, by means of the truth, those who were once his spiritual guides. Another blind man has joined the study with him because of his preaching. He now goes along with the publisher who first brought him the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and helps him conduct studies with those who are seeking spiritual sight. Yes, this blind man is a little different from most of us, because he has received his spiritual sight before his literal sight. So never hesitate to start a study with a blind man; there is no telling what can come from a blind person’s study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There has been a one-percent drop in the average number of publishers engaging in the field ministry in Denmark. It appears that some who were previously active have allowed themselves to become weak spiritually and have given in to the pressure of the times and are now striving after material luxuries and pleasures. A few others have succumbed to the growing resistance and opposition to belief in God and the Bible. Others gave up because of the opposition to our work by those opposed to the message of truth and the preaching of the good news. Then there was the court case that the Society had pertaining to our right to distribute books and magazines for a small contribution from house to house. The Supreme Court of Denmark ruled against us in December of 1964, and this made it necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to change their methods of approach at the homes. Now in going from house to house they must either give the literature away free or take orders and make a later delivery. A few became discouraged over this decision, but there was certainly no need to become downhearted. The brothers who have continued on faithfully, and that is by far the majority of the witnesses of Jehovah, are still going from house to house distributing literature. More magazines are placed with the people now than ever before and when speaking the truth to the people at their homes they take orders for literature and make delivery later. Often, when magazines are given away free, the publisher returns to begin Bible studies in the home. Then, too, they make regular delivery of magazines and establish magazine routes. The territory is covered thoroughly, as can be seen by the ratio of publishers to the population—one to 429. The branch in Copenhagen also looks after the work in the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and we have reports from these places as well as Denmark itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Making full use of every opportunity to advance the Kingdom work is necessary if one is to get results. This is even more true when territory has been worked often. A young brother who understood this principle was faced with the usual objection: “I am not interested.” “Perhaps it would be of interest to your husband,” was the young publisher’s friendly reply. The woman called for her husband, and, in spite of the fact that he previously always spurned Jehovah’s witnesses, he accepted two magazines this time. The next two times the publisher was invited inside for a discussion, though they had not yet read the magazines. By the following visit the wife had read the magazines and accepted the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New”</span><span class="font5"> and two new magazines. Things began to pick up. On the next visit they obtained the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> and accepted an invitation to the public talk, which they attended. For two weeks the brother was away on a trip and by the time he had returned the couple had written to the Society to order two additional books and to subscribe for the two magazines. A regular weekly Bible study was now arranged, and, additionally, to the encouragement of the Witnesses in the local study center, they began to attend all the meetings regularly, bringing their three children along. Soon thereafter they began to take part in preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a person really wants to start a Bible study, he will make full use of every opportunity. A brother was asked to renew the subscription for a family who had recently moved into the congregation’s territory. On calling there he was welcomed inside by a friendly, hospitable family with a lively interest in the Bible, and who had subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for twenty-five years. Surely here was an opportunity to start a study, and the brother did just that. By the end of two years the results were heartwarming. He had the privilege of attending a circuit assembly where all seven members of this family were present. In telling of this experience, the father was asked if he was happy that the study had been started. “Yes, absolutely! I am sure that if we had not had the study, none of us would be here at this assembly today.” Another member of the family exclaimed: “The truth means so much to us that we talk about it every single day. But now that is not enough; we feel the need to speak with others about it and therefore have started in the field service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the way through Sweden to the Oslo assembly a special pioneer had an unusual experience. He was driving in his little car with his wife and children when they had a motor breakdown with a piston through the block. Another brother came by on the way to the assembly and, though he could not help, he offered to send someone back from the next auto repair garage to which he came. Soon a mechanic came, looked at the damaged motor and shook his head, saying that it would take four days and cost more than $150 to repair. The brother mentioned that they were on the way to the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses but now did not know how they could make it. Immediately the man’s eyes brightened up and he towed them all the way to his garage. There he pointed to another car he had just overhauled and said: “Put your baggage in there and get on your way to Oslo.” “Yes, but what will it cost?” asked our brother. “Never mind now,” the man replied. “I will put gas and oil in the car and you folks be on your way. I know that Jehovah’s witnesses will come back.” This little family drove away greatly moved, stopping after a few kilometers to offer a fervent thanks to Jehovah, and then came on to the assembly, enjoying it to the full. On their way home one week later and after having driven altogether about 1600 kilometers, they came with another brother to get their car and tow it to Denmark. The garage owner greeted them, helped them transfer their baggage to their own car and wished them a good trip home. And the cost? The man finally accepted fifty crowns (about $10).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The efforts of the past service year resulted in the starting of two new publishers to share in the special April activity. Other than this activity, the climax of the year was the assembly in Oslo, Norway. Young and old alike made arrangements to attend the “Word of Truth” Assembly. An elderly sister from the islands was present for three days of the assembly and was then paralyzed by a stroke and taken to the hospital, where she later died. But before she died she exclaimed to brothers visiting her: “Oh, how happy I am that I made the long trip and have been present for this wonderful assembly! And how strengthening it has been to our faith with all that we have learned through the organization about the resurrection! I am happy that I have come out of Babylon the Great and have been allowed to dedicate my life to Jehovah and to preach as much as I could.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Faroes are made up of a group of eighteen smaller islands. Thorshaven is the capital and serves as the trade and shipping center. This city and its inhabitants have been swept along with the changes and commercial developments, which make it easier for one to break free from the bonds of traditional community life and show interest in the truth. A friendly man from a small village moved into Thor-shaven and rented a room at the same place where one of Jehovah’s witnesses lived. These two began to talk about different things, and the topic of conversation came around to religious subjects. The man had many Bible questions, and soon he was invited to attend a public talk. He attended, doubtless due to the greater freedom of now living in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> larger town. A Bible study has now been arranged, and this man will be helped further to grow in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This vast northern territory with its few, scattered inhabitants, its extremely difficult language and its extremes of climate makes great demands of those who will preach up here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the thinly spread population, which can be reached only by extensive and expensive traveling, the preaching takes a great deal of time. Witnessing by correspondence plays an important part in caring for newly interested persons. By means of letter writing a sister has been able to witness to persons in extremely isolated areas that we have never visited. She obtained a list of the names and addresses of the church elders in each village and wrote them, suggesting that they exchange correspondence. In this way the message of the Kingdom has reached to Greenland’s isolated east coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experience shows how well known our activities are. A young pioneer brother was visiting a small coastal village where he spent some time preaching and some at secular work. While he was working, an American naval vessel approached the small harbor and some officers came ashore to make some inquiries. The young brother helped with interpreting, and the officers began asking the different ones there who they were and what they did and also asked for the local priest. The priest was there and, after explaining that he was the priest for the Lutheran Danish Peoples’ Church, he pointed to the young brother saying that he belonged to one of those small insignificant sects. Our brother broke in and explained that he was a missionary for Jehovah’s witnesses under the direction of the Watch Tower Society. “Oh! We know all about that!” exclaimed the men. “We have seen your buildings in Brooklyn many times, and everywhere we have been in the world we have seen Jehovah’s witnesses preaching. It’s all over the world!” After remarking on this for some time and commending the activities of the Witnesses, the one officer turned his attention again to the priest and inquired: “By the way, what was the name of that church you are associated with?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Population: 4,070,108 Peak Publishers: 1,750 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,826</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to preach the Word under difficult circumstances as well as during favorable times. The past year’s record shows that Jehovah’s servants in the Dominican Republic had a work to do and they did it well. In a war-torn country, such as the Dominican Republic was for months during the past year, Jehovah’s witnesses had a wonderful opportunity to comfort those who mourn. Before the year was past, Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed a 23-percent increase. They reached a peak of 1,750 publishers in the land. During all the trouble there Jehovah’s witnesses did not fail to assemble together in God’s house. But let the report from the branch servant tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April was a month of stirring events for Jehovah’s people and for the entire country. One hundred and sixty-one vacation pioneers joined the 124 special and regular pioneers in the field, thus putting one out of every six publishers in the country in some feature of the pioneer service. Crowning the month was the attendance of 5,268 at the Memorial celebration. Then came April 24 and the revolution. The entire capital, Santo Domingo, became a battlefield resounding with the crack of rifles, the chatter of machine guns and the sound of planes zooming down to strafe their targets. Electric-power service failed, telephone service deteriorated into confusion, postal service and public transportation were paralyzed. Does one preach the Word amid conditions like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inside one’s house one’s mind gets the impression that the streets are filled with men firing in all directions. For a couple of days most unarmed persons stayed inside. But people have to go out eventually for food and fuel, and so did Jehovah’s witnesses. They found that usually from about 5 a.m. up to 11 a.m. the firing experienced a lull, and so the missionaries, pioneers and publishers began to make use of the time to get out and witness, and then gradually to increase their activity as circumstances allowed. Meetings too must go on, and the service center organization kept all meetings going at convenient locations. While everyone, to an extent, was obliged to risk his life to obtain material food ana necessary things, yet it was thrilling indeed to see our brothers and sisters literally “take their life in their hands” to get to vital meetings and partake of spiritual food. Plans even went ahead for the holding of circuit assemblies in towns outside the capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Happily, none of the brothers were killed and only one lost his small home. A policeman’s wild shot did enter the home of a sister and passed through one shoulder and out the other and then lodged in the back of the head of another sister. After facing up to the blood issue in two clinics, they were finally attended in a third and were found free of serious damage. The one sister’s head was sewed up and she was released. Four days later she noticed a lump in her head, and an X ray showed the bullet lodged between her scalp and skull. It didn’t hurt and the doctor said it was not dangerous, so the sister attended the meeting that afternoon and gave her assigned student talk in the theocratic school—with the bullet still in her head! The following day she had it removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year a brother in the small town of N---- had the opportunity to prove that his fear of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God was greater than his fear of those who can kill only the body. He was sitting in the plaza late one afternoon discussing the Bible with another person when the time came for the lowering of the flag at the police station. At the policeman’s call of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“/Aten-cion!”,</span><span class="font5"> his mind turned to the year’s text and he remained seated. He was taken before the sergeant in command and booked for trial under the charge of ‘insulting the national flag.’ However, when his trial came up he was able to explain to the judge his Christian stand and also that as a rule he endeavored not to be in the plaza at that hour so as not to have difficulty with the authorities. The judge’s decision: innocent of any wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ECUADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,153,918</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,679</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Ecuador deliver each issue of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines to the subscribers, due to the fact that the post office does not do this work. This keeps the publishers very busy in addition to their regular house-to-house activity. This system has its advantages, though, because it keeps the individual who obtained the subscription calling back regularly and seeing the subscriber quite often. If the person is not at home when the publisher calls, the magazine is left anyway. Sometimes very good back-calls develop and Bible studies are started because of this method of return visits. When the mails cannot take care of the regular delivery of the magazines, Jehovah’s witnesses can. This practice is followed in a number of countries throughout the world. Another thing, there is extreme poverty in many places in Ecuador, but still an excellent witness is given in these places too. There was a 10-percent increase in publishers, but still there is a lot of work to be done in Ecuador. The brothers are working hard to accomplish it. Here are some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have many publishers in rural areas where persistence in making back-calls requires considerable sacrifice. For instance, a special pioneer brother is assigned to work in a village on the fringes of the eastern jungle. Since the village is small, he spends much of his time working along roads and pathways. He contacted a family that showed considerable interest and made arrangements to call back, but when the day came for the revisit the rains came as they come only in the jungle. He might easily have been discouraged by the sheets of rain, but he had made the arrangement and he was sticking to it. Through pouring rain he walked in the dark for five kilometers, to find the house filled with fifteen people, among them an Evangelist missionary. It was a long and eventful evening and the quiet, competent way in which the special pioneer measured Biblical arguments against tradition made an impression on the interested family. But the impression made by his having kept his word, walking miles in a tropical rainstorm, was even greater. The family now studies twice a week, attends the meetings and is making fine progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the isolated territory where this brother works, considerable difficulty had been experienced in finding a place to hold meetings. Pressure was brought against the owners of every house the brother rented, and he was forced to move to new locations time and time again. In view of these difficulties, the special pioneer and another at an assignment some fifty miles distant decided to use their vacation to build a Kingdom Hall and home. Incidentally, the brother who was experiencing the difficulty is a native of one of the so-called uncivilized tribes of Indians and the other is a European brother who came to serve where the need is great. From early morning until midnight the two of them worked side by side, chopping wood and laying bricks faster than that village had ever seen. Toward the end of the construction, wood was lacking. As the two brothers stood perplexed in front of the building, along came the majordomo of some property owned by Catholic priests. He complimented them on their fast work and asked some questions as to their belief. As a result, a Catholic Bible was placed with him and he made a contribution of the amount of wood needed to finish the building. About this time the Indian brother still lacked some time in the field service to meet the requirements for the month, so he left his companion working alone for a while. When he returned he found that the European brother had enjoyed some fine conversations in the meantime with observing villagers who wanted to know how it was that he, a “gringo,” was doing the dirty work while his “worker” was out with suit and tie. This gave excellent opportunities to speak of the unity and equality among Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can young publishers conduct productive Bible studies? They certainly can. A sister had been studying with a lady whose nine-year-old daughter, although not participating in the study, had been listening m the background. One day she came out and told the sister, without prompting, that she also wanted to study the Bible. The sister showed her the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and told her she would bring along a young friend who would be glad to help her understand. So an elevenyear-old publisher began this new study with her nine-year-old student. Although taught by nuns in a religious school, the child was soon taking her </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book to school with her to prepare her study during the recreation periods. In time her mother was called to the school to explain why her daughter was refusing to sit in on Catechism classes and take part in religious ceremonies. The mother explained that she and her daughter no longer believed in such things and that this would be the last year she would be attending that school. Some time later one of the publishers received a telephone call from an aunt of the child, asking if she would study the Bible with her. The reason? Well, the grandmother of this child was nearing the point of death and, in the midst of a family reunion, she and others had been deeply impressed on listening to the child offer a heartfelt prayer “different from our Catholic prayers, and calling God ‘Jehovah’ ” before her grandmother’s deathbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,814,703</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The past service year has been a truly memorable one for Jehovah’s witnesses in Eire. In June well over 3,000 brothers from Britain and other lands joined with the Irish brothers at Dublin in the “Word of Truth” Assembly. Such a large nonCatholic gathering was unique in Eire. It accomplished the greatest witness to the Kingdom ever given in that country. Throughout the year the publishers who live in Eire, the special pioneers and congregation publishers, worked zealously in the ministry and spent a record number of hours in declaring the good news. Now, since the assembly is past, they are following up the interest with good results. They are getting more Bible studies started, and the brothers in Eire feel that the 1966 service year will prove to be another outstanding one. Here are a few interesting experiences sent in from Eire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the assembly many of the clergy have sought to undermine its effect by denouncing Jehovah’s witnesses. However, the public has been able to see firsthand that the Witnesses are a peaceable people with a genuine, practical love for their neighbors. This is evidenced by the experience of a blind man who heard of the opposition to the assembly but had not been in contact with the Witnesses. On his own initiative he attended the assembly and was so impressed by the spirit of love he felt that the following week he made his own way to the branch office to ask for a Bible study. He proved to be an apt student and is now attending the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The benefits of witnessing to friends and relatives is well illustrated by the following experience: A brother was invited to the home of a lifelong friend, a Catholic, whose mother had recently died. The brother discussed the Scriptures in order to give comfort, with the result that a study was established in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font5"> A few weeks after the study was started this man began a study with his children in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book. At first his wife was opposed, but as she observed the beneficial effect of the studies on her husband and the children she agreed to have a Bible study. First the man and then his wife began to attend meetings and then share in the service. Around the time he started to study with his children this newly interested man also visited his sister in a nearby town in order to witness to her. The outcome was that arrangements were made for her to have a regular study. She too made rapid progress and is now publishing. In the meantime this man, now a brother, decided to change houses with another local family. On leaving the house he purposely left behind some magazines in the hope that the new family would read them. A little while later a missionary sister called on this latter family and was immediately invited in by the man, who had had previous contact with the truth and whose interest had been reawakened by the magazines. The sister arranged for the new brother, who had just left the house, to visit this man, and this resulted in a Bible study with him. Despite opposition from his wife, he also began a study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book with his children. Shortly his wife’s opposition lessened and she agreed to have a Bible study with a special pioneer sister. Soon the man and his children were attending meetings and sharing in the service, and it was not long before his wife joined them in this. Both families attended the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Dublin. Thus this brother has had the happy privilege of aiding his own family into the truth as well as his sister and the other family. Recently he made a point of dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cussing the truth with his three natural brothers, and they too are showing a favorable response.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Children who want to please Jehovah God must have in mind the words of the apostle Peter, who said: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.” (1 Pet. 2:12) All of Jehovah’s witnesses have to keep this in mind as the trend of nationalism grows stronger in every country. Especially must schoolchildren have this in mind. The problem of flag saluting has come to the fore in El Salvador in what they call there “The prayer to the flag.” So far the children of Jehovah’s witnesses who have been standing firm so as not to violate God’s law on image worship have been able to hold their ground, and a good witness is being given. Here are some interesting experiences from El Salvador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Keeping up with Jehovah’s right principles has helped our young brothers keep their conduct fine among the nations, as is brought out by this experience. A twelveyear-old publisher who is in the fifth grade was confronted with this problem. The teacher asked that each student sing the national hymn individually. Since all the students were lined up in a row, it finally came time for this young brother to sing. He refused, but asked that the teacher give him a chance to explain why he could not sing the national hymn or give the pledge of allegiance to the flag. Briefly he explained his position Biblically. After hearing the frankness and sincerity of this young Witness, the teacher decided not to obligate him to do it. But the story does not end there. When the young brother arrived home, he explained to his father what had happened. Since his father was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses and had very little Bible knowledge, his father- told him that he should have sung the national hymn. “Why,” he said, “they could have expelled you from school.” The young publisher just pointed to the 1965 calendar of Jehovah’s witnesses showing the three faithful Hebrews and said: “Father, look! What do you think that picture means?” Understanding what his son meant, the father could not say anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of making back-calls is emphasized by this experience. A missionary working from house to house placed magazines with a lady but at the same time noticed another younger lady in the house with only one leg who looked very depressed. This alert sister then spoke to her, giving special attention to the conditions in the new system of things. The message did not seem to register with the young woman, but she did accept the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet, with the promise of the sister to return the following week. Faithfully the sister called back each week and finally started a study with her. After finishing the booklet the study was continued in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, and a change began to be noted in this young woman. Later, it was found out that this young woman was at the point of taking her own life when the first call was made on her. Now, having the promise of God’s Word, she has something to live for and, not only that, she has symbolized her dedication by water baptism. Now her desire is not to take her life but, despite her handicap, to share with others the good news she has learned.</span></p>

This was commendable, for over the past five years there has been a constant drift of overseas brothers who had been serving where the need is great as well as local publishers away from the small islands of the South Pacific to larger countries, Australia, the United States and New Zealand. Fiji and American Samoa were the most affected. Here are some interesting items from the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To carry on the witness work in the South Pacific presents many problems. Just to get circuit servants from one island to the other is difficult. However, the Society manages to do this so as to give good service to the brothers. There is also a problem with the different dialects on the islands, but interpreters are always found among the brothers. While we always look at the South Pacific as a picturesque territory in which to work, still there, as everywhere else in the world, one has to deal with people of all kinds, and the results are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother who was raised in the truth took an active interest in boxing and other things and went right out into the world for some years. He did very well for himself for a time. Then he lost his self-confidence and began to stutter so badly that it was difficult to make himself understood. While boarding with an elder brother who was studying, he came in contact with the truth again. Then he became very ill with hepatitis and thought he was going to die. During this time he reflected very seriously about his wasted life and vowed that if he recovered he would compensate for it. True to his word, he studied diligently, persevered at preaching despite his impediment and joined the ministry school, though it was difficult for him to speak because his stuttering worsened with nervousness. However, as knowledge increased, confidence grew and Jehovah supplemented his lack. What of him today? He zealously expends himself to those under his care as a special pioneer, gives stirring talks from his heart, always has good, eventful experiences to tell at assemblies, is an untiring volunteer worker highly regarded by the brothers because of his faithful diligence in the ministry. And it is a pleasure to report that he no longer stutters. Those who knew him in his youth say, “Welcome back, prodigal brother!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is tract distribution really effective? Can results be obtained from these little strips of finely condensed literature? Regular house-to-house preaching is not permitted in one private mining town where 5,000 people live, but a pioneer reached an interested person through a tract. He gave a boy a tract on hellfire, with directions to deliver it to his father. More inquiries followed and, later, back-calls. Two studies resulted from that little tract, and a whole family is progressing in learning Jehovah’s truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,581</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Persistence in the ministry pays dividends. A study with a couple was started under difficulties. The wife, a Catholic, raised objections, endeavoring to end the discussions. Sometimes a lock was placed on the outside door to suggest that no one was home. But at times these intentions were frustrated when their eldest little boy enthusiastically ran out on seeing the couple coming, calling out to his hidden parents, “The minister is here.” With persistence the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet was slowly covered. They informed the brother they were moving, but no new address was given. However, they were located and the study was resumed. On their going through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font5"> the truth started to take a definite pattern in their minds and hearts. The husband began applying Bible principles at work in a factory. He stopped helping himself to food used for canning as others did and was criticized by workmates. But honesty paid off when the staff was questioned about items being stolen. He informed his overseer that, before Jehovah, he could not steal things. When asked if he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he answered, Yes. His overseer then informed him that he knew he could not be implicated because he was aware that Jehovah’s witnesses are honest people. Today this couple are training their young family in the principles of honesty too, and both are happy, baptized publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the most thickly populated area, covered sometimes twice in three weeks, one family was particularly strong in refusing to have any brothers enter their home. The head of the house, an elderly man, was a retired minister. So, according to their wishes, their house was bypassed time after time. During a circuit servant’s visit two sisters working the area were about to pass this family again. One said: “We had better do this house, as it has been some time since it was worked.” She suggested that the other wait while she made her way up to the house. “You’ll hear the blast from here,” she said. She approached the house and was met by the man. She explained our ministry. He said, “All right.” She wasn’t sure whether he meant she had said enough and to get going or what, so she started to explain again, when he broke in and abruptly said, “Well, come in.” After getting her friend, the sisters went in. The sermon was given, two books were placed and arrangements were made to call back. Since then the retired minister has studied and is delighted with the new things he is learning from a Witness young enough to be his grandson. And for the first time, after having spent so many years himself in missionary work, he is learning something from the Bible. He attends meetings, and his entire family are friendly now. Will you be passing up that household of “opposed” people in your territory? You never know what may happen if you do call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GILBERT AND ELLICE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48,051</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Four years ago a family of four arrived to serve where the need is great. For three years they had no fellowship with a congregation, attended no assemblies nor was the circuit servant able to get there. Despite this, they kept in remarkably good spiritual shape, conducted regular meetings and kept up with the latest flow of truths. The husband and wife studied Gilbertese and now fluently converse about the truth in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They acquired a small yacht to enable them to visit interested ones on other islets. English is little spoken and less read. The brother translates main points from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> paragraphs, with appropriate scriptures, and uses this as a basis for studies. The result of patient efforts is that four families now show sincere interest. The circuit servant was able to see them this year. Fifteen adults and their children attended a special gathering. Paul’s words are appropriate: we should never “give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COOK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,720</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Up to now almost all preaching activity has been confined to Rarotonga, the largest island. Some years ago a family from New Zealand moved there to serve where the need is great. They have done splendid work as special pioneers and their twelve-year-old son is doing well as a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two visits were made by special representatives during the year. Their first small assembly was held during the last visit, which fortified them and strengthened all to carry on faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW CALEDONIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,480</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 89 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 949</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congregations reflect the overseer’s attitude. An overseer, a father of four children, and his wife regularly pioneer while on vacation from school teaching. During the year the congregation went ahead by leaps and bounds and many vacation pioneered too. Sixteen new publishers were baptized this year. A special pioneer was sent out to organize different isolated groups of publishers and interested persons. This involved much travel, so the congregation lovingly bought a late-model car to enable him to get around. Another congregation is in the making in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A righteously disposed Catholic heard many good reports about the Witnesses. He was never home when they called, though. His wife was not interested but obtained two books for him, as she felt he would be interested in them. He was very impressed by what he read, but met with resistance when he began telling his wife about it. He asked </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> man at work, whom he knew to be a Witness, if he would come to his home and study those books with him. It was not long before his wife began relenting in her attitude and joined the study. The impressive and amazing things they learned prompted them to talk to his sister, a catechist at a local school. She listened, reasoned on what she had heard, but continued teaching Catechism; she concluded that there must be some explanation to support what she believed and taught. In course of time those planted seeds began sprouting and troubling her, particularly the matter of Mary being the mother of God. She approached the priest in charge to iron out her questions, but no satisfaction was given and she was still in a quandary. Her conscience was troubling her too. Finally it prompted her to approach him to say she could no longer conscientiously teach what she no longer believed. He released her but said he wanted a discussion with the Witnesses. This lasted hours, during which church tradition was propounded, none of it Scriptural. That young woman is now zestfully studying. Her brother and his wife are baptized now, delighted that their close affection is heightened because of their added spiritual relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61,476</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During a recent district servant’s visit, up to twenty-four persons attended three special meetings. They now have a fine Kingdom Hall, which is very well equipped. Although only an isolated group not yet qualifying for a congregation chart, they made one of their own. A specially drawn-up map of the ten countries included in the branch hangs there, and figures are changed when necessary, indicating their loving interest in brothers elsewhere. Use of the hall was given free by a kindly Chinese businessman, who also helped them buy chairs at a very reduced rate from a relative’s shop. Brothers have worked this extremely difficult territory for seven years. During this time they learned French and had tropical illnesses, including malaria. Progress was slow. Then two years ago they were joined by zealous brothers serving where the need is great. Continued faithful work has at last borne fruit. Four local publishers now work with them. Six months ago the Society urged them to learn Pidgin-English, hold meetings in it and to use illustrated sermons, as immediate interest lies in people who speak this. Excellent results have been had. Their fine spirit and faithfulness, coupled with extreme patience, are commendable. They will be rewarded with their first assembly next March, which New Caledonian brothers have indicated they will attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NIUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,993</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Brothers here are very isolated and the circuit servant was unable to get there during the year. However, the brothers are continuing in the best way they can. Two brothers were able to attend January’s assembly in Fiji during Brother Knorr’s visit. There are very fine opportunities here for New Zealand brothers who may be able to obtain employment and strengthen the brothers. We hope that in the coming year there will be further theocratic development here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TAHITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 94 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 899</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During 1965 the brothers were fortified by two good assemblies. January’s incorporated part of the district assembly program and the film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News.’ ” The second, held in June, was crowned with fifteen baptisms. Five of these were Europeans contacted by local Tahitian publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It takes many years for some studies to bear fruit. In 1962 a study was started with an interested lady. After one year there were no positive results. Further, the husband objected because, as he said, “We have another religion.” However, he tolerated her continued study. The sister who began the study handed it to another. This sister continued with it for a few months, after which she had to leave the territory. It was transferred to yet another’s care. It finally petered out after a few months and was definitely terminated. Eight months later, another sister, about to begin vacation pioneering, decided to find this lady, as she was seeking prospective studies. The lady was thrilled on being contacted again and requested that the study be recommenced. Shortly afterward, her husband manifested interest and he was studied with. The lady’s sister, brother, cousin and their children all became interested too. Today that lady is baptized. Her husband, sister and brother, as well as one of the children, are publishers; their home is the service center. Her cousin and husband are setting their affairs in order to qualify for field service. Rich rewards await those taking the initiative to contact lost “sheep.” Jehovah blesses work done with perseverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TONGA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,537</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,171</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently the circuit and district servants visited nine brothers here and were very impressed with the faithful efforts put forth by them to keep the organization going without outside assistance. Fine meetings were held. They are firm for upholding the cleanness of God’s organization and are zealous in seeing that it keeps that way. It is amazing that people so isolated should feel so strongly about this, considering that most were contacted through incidental witnessing and have never seen an organized congregation in operation. It certainly is proper that this should be so. What knowledge they have was acquired mostly through personal study. Those brothers are very keen to progress, and we feel sure this progress would be rapid if brothers could serve here where the need is great. The basis for a congregation is already here. A married couple could do much to help. Jehovah’s spirit is evidently upon this group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WESTERN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124,200</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 72 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,725</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When brothers expend themselves to promote Jehovah’s work, blessings are sure to result. The Society decided to leave two special pioneers with the main congregation to aid twenty-two sisters who have families. A suggestion was made to the brothers that they might be able to find a room for the sisters, as their present accommodation was not suitable. The response was inspiring. They built them a small, neat thatched Samoan hut adjoining the Kingdom Hall. From this little hub of theocratic activity preaching was organized three mornings </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> week. At least six sisters received assistance each day. Some were heartened enough to formulate practical family schedules that left them free one day each week for preaching. With assistance from the special pioneers fifty-three reported regularly for the following three months, whereas only thirtyseven had done so during the previous months. Pioneers can be a valuable asset to any congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The district servant was able to visit them for the first time in four and a half years. An assembly was held, during which the new film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ ” was shown. The hall was literally packed out so that not one more person was able to get in. Consequently some solved the problem by climbing stepladders and trees to enable them to see through windows. The response was filled with enthusiasm, especially when the brothers saw themselves on the screen at the Fiji assembly. Poor as they may be, the brothers found it in their hearts to donate much food to the cafeteria, even two pigs, which made it possible to provide good food at a reasonable cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,610,974</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,868 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 467</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Finnish brothers were filled with joy because they all received many blessings at the grand “Word of Truth” Assembly held in Helsinki, June 23-27,1965. Associated with them were thousands of their Swedish brothers who came over from Sweden for the convention. The assembly proved to be one of the greatest witnesses the city of Helsinki ever received. The officials of the city became better acquainted with these orderly and peace-loving people. Due to this assembly many persons have wanted to learn more about the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses, and quite a large number of Bible studies have been started in the homes of persons who accommodated the visitors to the city. An excellent witness was given throughout the entire country, and here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time ago a qualified, mature brother notified the Society that he wanted to serve where the need is great. He was notified of a small city where work had been done for years without any results worth mentioning. The brother and his family started zealous activity on behalf of Kingdom interests in the district. First, he gathered together the few friends who were there and began to assist them, in accord with the Society’s instructions. After putting forth an effort for a time, he succeeded in enlivening the congregation’s activity very much. Attention was given to all features of activity, and in that congregation of fourteen publishers the figures started to rise and the congregation began to reach and even pass the goals set by the Society in all features of the work. The circuit servant drew attention to this progress and mentioned: “Now you can expect plenty of growth in your congregation, because the goals have been so well reached and the brothers have grown to spiritual maturity.” Up till this time the work had been done with little results, and the brothers wondered where the increase could now come from. However, they trusted in Jehovah, and, as the congregation servant wrote: “Not much more than a week had gone by after the circuit servant’s departure, when a young woman phoned me and asked: ‘Could someone come and study with me?’ A month later that woman started in the service. The following week I went to a home on a back-call to renew an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine subscription, and a message had been left there asking Jehovah’s witnesses to visit another home. I went there immediately on getting the message and was able to start a study right away. After studying for two months the lady of the house asked: ‘When can I go with you preaching?’ In addition to her, two other members of the family have started in the service. About the same time a woman who had studied previously but had discontinued it started to attend meetings and asked that the study be started with her again, because T have decided to dedicate myself to Jehovah,’ she said. In one year the congregation increased from fourteen to twenty-four publishers. The congregation’s hours and service averages did not decrease because of the new ones coming in, but, on the contrary, the figures kept on rising and, with Jehovah’s help, we expect more increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is reason to pay attention to even the slightest sign of interest, as the letter of one pioneer shows: “While going from house to house I met a young woman to whom I was able to give a sermon. For some reason she refused to take the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book when I presented it to her, but because I thought she was at least a little interested I presented the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Look! I Am Making All Things New,’</span><span class="font5"> and she took it. At the same time I showed her how to study the booklet so as to get the best possible benefit from it. This first visit took place at the end of November. At the beginning of December I called on her again, and then the woman asked: ‘Could you not call some evening when my husband is home, because he too would like to discuss religious questions?’ When I went back with a companion on the evening arranged, we got a very warm reception, and the man really proved to be interested in religion and had great respect for the Bible. Our discussion was very lively, and, on receiving answers to his questions, the man would always say, 'That answer satisfies me.’ One evening the man phoned me and asked: 'How do you Jehovah’s witnesses celebrate Christmas?’ At first I thought that maybe they would not understand our point of view, but that worry was in vain, because, after my explanation, the man said that he understood the matter well and added, ‘The Christmas tree money can be saved, then.’ Both he and his wife started in the service the same month, and the man has taken a firm stand at his place of work too and has got a workmate interested in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother wrote: “I was in a situation where almost all witnessing had to be done by letter. I received an expired-subscription slip, but this subscriber lived a long way away in territory that was not assigned to any congregation. I started to write to the woman and soon got an answer, in which I was asked to renew the subscription for the magazine. We started a Bible study by letter based on the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Look! I Am Making All Things New.’</span><span class="font5"> I wrote the questions on paper, leaving space for the answers. She regularly sent the paper back with the answers. I then corrected the answers, if there was anything to correct, and sent it back together with new questions. Because of an accident in the family one of her sons also started to answer the questions I sent, and so I conducted a study with two members of that family. I tried to make the study interesting, and so I used the written review sheets from the Theocratic Ministry School as a model in making their questions, and we rejoiced together at the progress. As I thought that personal conversation would be upbuilding to them, I wrote to the overseer of the nearest congregation about the matter, and he arranged a visit to that home. Soon I received the joyful news that the son was baptized, and the mother is progressing well in a knowledge of the truth.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in France were richly blessed because of their Kingdom activity. It has been wonderful to observe that year after year the growth of the Kingdom work in France has been steady. The number of publishers has increased, and the brothers have advanced toward maturity. They show zeal and love for the work. The branch office in Paris looks after a large area—all of France, Algeria, Republic of Mali, Republic of Senegal and the Republic of Tunisia. Here are experiences from each of these countries.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">While publishers do good work in the field service, this does not make them forget to speak about the truth to their own family. This thoughtfulness often produces remarkable increase, as the following report shows: A young woman living with her family became a witness of Jehovah. She began a home Bible study with her mother, one of her sisters and her own two sons. They all accepted the truth. Then the sister first baptized got her cousin and his fiancee to attend the meetings. Later, she obtained a Bible for another of her sisters and began a study with her and her husband. After three years of study this sister and her husband accepted the truth and were baptized. Then this new brother began a study with his own sister and her husband. They also accepted the truth and were baptized. This same new brother also began a study with his father-in-law and with a son-in-law and a nephew of the father-in-law. All three are now regular publishers. Now this same brother has got his mother to subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and she too attends the meetings. In one year this family has registered six baptisms. In this family there are seven dedicated publishers and thirteen active publishers, and the number attending meetings totals seventeen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is important to call back on persons whose subscriptions have expired. But what can be done if they live too far away to be called on? A brother received an expired-subscription slip from the Society. In view of the fact that it was winter and this person lived thirty miles away, the brother entrusted the slip to his wife and encouraged her to write. His wife wrote to the former subscriber, a lady, putting into practice the counsel given in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> on how to approach persons whose subscriptions have expired. A few days later the lady replied, sending in her renewal. She said that she had read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for many years and appreciates it very much. Seeing the interest of the person, the sister wrote to her again giving a broader witness. The subscriber replied: “I received your letter with much joy and I thank you very sincerely for not abandoning me in a world full of difficulties and injustice. Really, your letters help me to keep the faith and to be confident. Being alone, I draw strength from my beliefs and my faith in the Bible, in the midst of a village and region where everybody is terribly Catholic and not at all sympathetic toward the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom.” Arrangements were made to have this person called on. A study was begun with her and now she is baptized and is a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experience comes to us from a vacation pioneer, showing how the anonymous witness given by a witness of Jehovah in a Nazi concentration camp twenty years ago is now bearing fruit. A sister, a vacation pioneer, contacted a woman sixty years of age or more. This lady could not accept the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazine because she could not see to read very well, due to what she suffered during the second world war. She was the wife of an officer who was killed, and she was deported by the Germans and put into a concentration camp. The sister asked her if she had ever met any of Jehovah’s witnesses in that camp. The lady did not remember. However, she was very happy to learn the truths from this sister, and as a result of many calls her interest became greater. Some months later the lady found the bonnet she wore while in the concentration camp, and in the lining of the bonnet she found a letter she had hidden. This letter was a message of comfort she had received from a prisoner, and it was signed, “A witness of Jehovah.” Now this gave her great joy. In spite of opposition from the priest and other pressures, she continues to make good progress in the truth and has recently expressed her desire to serve Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Many studies are begun with Europeans who make rapid progress in the faith. But the problem facing the publishers is the large number of persons who return to France. This does not cancel the studies, because the names and addresses of these persons are sent to the Society so that they can be visited in France. Such a case happened recently with a lady in Algeria who had begun to study, to attend meetings and even to take part in the field service. However, the opposition from the husband got more and more violent. He told his wife henceforth not to invite the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">special pioneer who was teaching her, threatening to beat her if ever he saw her in his home again; he even went so far as to say that, if his wife continued to attend the meetings, he would throw a bomb into the Kingdom Hall! Even though deprived of meetings and visits, this lady did not get discouraged but, with confidence in Jehovah, went to the special pioneer’s home for the study. A little while afterward she had to return to France, but she did not let this hinder her spiritual progress. On the contrary, her husband now let her attend meetings. Recently, the special pioneer received a letter from this lady, saying: “Oh, how I appreciate the good things Jehovah kindly teaches me. I. am seriously thinking of being baptized. The New World society is so different from this world where we see nothing but quarrels, hate and many suchlike things. What a wonderful hope Jehovah has given to those who love him!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer placed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book with the wife of a judge who was a Catholic. The wife was very pleased to be able to have discussions on the Bible but not so the husband, who summoned the special pioneer to his office, where, abusing his authority, he told the brother he was not to preach anywhere in that town. But the matter did not end there, because the brother was apprehended several times by the police, the chief of police forbidding all his activity, saying: “This is not what I think; I’ve received orders.” The special pioneer obeyed God rather than men and continued his preaching activity discreetly for two months. He would leave his book bag at home, taking in his pockets a few magazines and booklets and knocking at only one or two doors in an apartment and then going on to another, paying special attention to back-calls, and so forth. Then, one day, he succeeded in getting in touch with the public attorney in order to explain his case. The attorney who is a Mussulman bounced up in his seat when he heard what the brother said. He exclaimed: “He hasn’t the right to stop you from carrying on your work!” He then telephoned the chief of police in the brother’s presence and refuted point by point the argument put forth by the chief of police, showing that the special pioneer, possessing a residence permit as a missionary, could legally carry on his preaching work. At the charge that the activity of the brother was subversive, the public attorney replied: “How can that be so, when I myself am a subscriber to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and I find nothing subversive in it!” The next day, the brother returned to see the chief of police, who gave back to him his documents, which had been confiscated, and allowed him to take up his work again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the service year the whole of the Bamako territory has been covered by the pioneers, who continue to publish courageously the good news of the Kingdom. The conditions are sometimes difficult, but the brothers take advantage of the religious tolerance generally shown and so the truth gets through. However, people who accept the publications are often subjected to pressure from the head of the family, who has much influence. On the radio a broadcast reserved for replies to letters from listeners spoke of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses and urged the population not to allow themselves to be turned from their faith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">An aged couple were visited by Jehovah’s witnesses during the witness work. This couple spoke to their pastor about this visit and he ordered them to put Jehovah’s witnesses out if ever they should return. Thus it was not possible to give these persons a further witness. Some time later this couple made friends with a couple who are Jehovah’s witnesses and who invited them, with other persons, to their home. A witness was given very discreetly and so well that, the next time they met, the husband wanted to learn more. A study was begun immediately. After two months of study this man had got rid of the fear of death, a fear that had always possessed him. Eight months after the first contact, this couple began to witness from house to house. They are determined to symbolize their dedication by baptism very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A family of Jehovah’s witnesses had as neighbors a lady, her two daughters and three grandchildren, aged eleven, fifteen and eighteen years. On the occasion of a religious celebration in honor of the eleven-year-old grandchild, the Witnesses were invited. Not being able to participate in this religious celebration, they asked to be excused, and their visit was put off for a few days. Later they were able to explain why their children received religious instruction so different from that given to the grandchild who is of the same age. The mother of this child accepted books and booklets and began to read them the same evening. A study was started immediately, and two months later her sister followed her example. On returning from vacation the grandmother also asked for a study. The children, however, were reticent at first, but quickly accepted the teaching that their mother gave them as she learned it herself. The oldest son, having had to leave the family in order to follow his higher studies in France, was visited at the request of his mother. He quickly accepted the truth and symbolized his dedication by being baptized. The mother took this step just one year after being contacted by the message, and this lady’s sister was immersed only six months after being contacted. At the present time, all the family participate in all features of the service, and their attendance at all the meetings is an example of faithfulness. The oldest son came home for a month for the Easter vacation. He spent it as a vacation pioneer!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While engaged in the house-to-house work, a sister called on a lady who showed interest and accepted some magazines. When the sister called back, this lady invited her into her home and told her how much she had enjoyed reading the magazines. She gladly accepted a home Bible study using the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font5">and the same evening spoke to her husband about it. He advised her right away not to study the book, saying: “This sect will eventually lead us to the point where we will have to take down from the walls all our saints and abandon the Catholic religion.” He begged his wife to accept one more visit from the sister and then politely to tell her that she was no longer interested. This woman did what her husband told her to do. The sister then explained to her that the purpose of the message was to give a witness to the truth and not to tell people to take down their statues or to change their religion, but that the people would do just those things of their own initiative through a knowledge of the truth. On hearing this, the lady agreed for the sister to visit her regularly, saying that she could not believe that the faith of a mother who found time to speak of God to her neighbors, in spite of bad weather, could be false and vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After six months of study this lady was convinced it was the truth. The following Easter the husband noticed that his wife did not kiss the feet of the statue of Jesus and neither did she take communion, as is the custom of Catholics at Easter. He asked her why, and she gave him the Scriptural reasons for not doing so. Her husband understood that his wife was continuing her studies with Jehovah’s witnesses, but he did not scold her because he realized that the reply she gave was not a suggestion from the sister but came directly from his wife. The woman is now anxious to attend all meetings and to have a share in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 58,818,600</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">By far the greater number of publishers in West Germany work very hard, but evidently due to the desire for material things some of the publishers slack their hands. Fewer hours were devoted to preaching the good news in Germany this year than last year. This is also true in West Berlin. The majority of Jehovah’s witnesses are putting up an exceptionally hard fight against materialism and are steadfastly preaching the good news. But when some of those who are dedicated lose their zeal and drift back to the desires of the flesh and the things this world has to offer, it cuts into the preaching of this good news of the Kingdom, and this is manifest in both West Germany and West Berlin. Maturity is something that everyone who is dedicated to Jehovah must strive for in life. Overseers should try to help those within the congregation to gain this maturity so that all will continue to appreciate their responsibilities before Jehovah and also feel the urgency now of preaching the good news everywhere. There is no doubt about it, a good witness was given in Germany during the past service year, but there were 50,000 fewer hours spent in the ministry in West Germany and 30,000 fewer hours in West Berlin. When we see this, it makes us stop and think, Are we doing our part? Or are we letting our hands droop a little? The brothers in Germany certainly enjoyed the “Word of Truth” Assemblies that they were able to attend, and many were baptized at these assem<a name="bookmark106"></a><a name="bookmark107"></a>blies. Here are some experiences from Germany and West Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister seventeen years of age met a young woman in her door-to-door work who explained that she led an unhappy married life and planned to separate from her husband. At the next back-call the sister considered with her the subject “Honorable Conduct in Marriage” in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iAving in Hope of a Righteous New World.</span><span class="font5"> After the consideration the woman said: “I thank you for discussing this particular subject with me. Now I know what I must do. Please pray for me, that I might have the strength to continue living with my husband.” She then told her husband of her decision to stay with him and how she arrived at it. Thereupon he requested that the publisher call when he would be at home, which she did. Quietly he listened to the prepared sermon. With the next call his manner and attitude changed, and he asked many questions. Since that time he has been present at the study and already tells others of the things learned. Since both of them are beginning to put on a new personality and bring forth the fruits of the spirit, their marriage problem is solving itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister conducted a Bible study with a young woman who was a staunch Catholic. This interested person soon realized that she had been falsely instructed by the church and eagerly accepted the truth. Since she lived in a small village the neighbors soon noticed that she was not attending church anymore and, of course, found out why. Then difficulties began. The husband was not opposed up to that time, but then he began to put pressure on his wife to break off association with Jehovah’s witnesses. She was desperate as to what to do. The sister gave her counsel about the manner in which a believing wife should conduct herself toward an unbelieving husband. As she normally was easily upset about everything and very nervous when differences arose, she put forth great effort to exercise self-control. The study continued and the woman began to attend the meetings along with her children without her husband knowing of it. After some time her husband said to her: “You do not need to keep silent about associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. You have changed so in your manner and are so quiet and happy, while I could fly to pieces out of rage and restlessness. The children are also altogether different.” This young woman was, of course, very happy about this observation of her husband, and her husband let her attend the meetings when she requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the meantime she has started going from house to house, conducts a home Bible study with her children and was baptized at the last circuit assembly. After they left the church, the husband asked his wife and children: “What are you now, if you aren’t Catholic anymore? Possibly Protestant?” The children, who are three and five years of age, said: “Papa, we are now Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Berlin is an island in the center of Communist East Germany. It is only in the western section of Berlin that the brothers can preach the Kingdom message in freedom and conduct their ministry as Jehovah’s witnesses do in other places under normal circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Berlin is a fast-living city and for that reason the brothers there endeavor to take every opportunity to witness concerning God’s established kingdom. A brother worked for some time as a taxi driver. He used every opportunity to carry on conversations about the Bible with his passengers. He offered them the newest issues of the magazines and thus increased his magazine distribution to 130 copies in one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister going from house to house contacted a lady who was deaf and dumb. At first the sister used stacks of slips for notes to make herself understood. She then left the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.” </span><span class="font5">When making the second call she referred to the last sentence of the booklet, where mention is made of preaching the Kingdom message. The deaf-and-dumb lady explained that she would like doing this, but did not know how it would be possible as she was completely dumb. The sister recommended that she share the Kingdom message with her husband, who was also deaf and dumb, as well as other deaf-and-dumb persons. The woman did this with great enthusiasm. A study was conducted regularly with her by means of the booklet. She soon came to the meetings. The brothers assisted her and wrote down the most essential thoughts of what was spoken so that she could follow along. At the home Bible study prayer was offered. Perhaps the question arises as to how that was possible. The sister sits very close to the interested person and they observe one another closely. The deaf lady watches the sister’s mouth and the sister can notice if the lady understands everything by closely observing her eyes. The sister who conducts the study in this manner said: “Especially at this study I can feel how Jehovah’s spirit is operating, and I am very grateful.” The interested person is very happy over the prospects one day of being able to hear and speak to praise Jehovah. It is definitely a joyous experience to see how Jehovah blesses the efforts of his servants, and this results in ever more righteously disposed people joining the song of praise to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the “Word of Truth” conventions was held in Berlin this service year. Brothers were present, not only from Berlin, but also many from West Germany as well as the United States and other countries. The support by so many brothers greatly strengthened the faith of the Berlin publishers. There were 8,916 present at the public talk, and 137 symbolized their dedication by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GHANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,690,730</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,422 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 710</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana believe the Bible and there comes to their mind this scripture: “Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man. For the true God himself will bring every sort of work into the judgment.. ., as to whether it is good or bad.” (Eccl. 12:13, 14) Taking this advice seriously and awaiting the outcome brings blessings. Here are some very interesting experiences that took place in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Togoland during the past year as reported by the branch servant in Ghana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of Jehovah’s witnesses was employed by the government railway as a ticket collector on a passenger train. He was transferred to the town of Kumasi and assigned to work on a particular train. Because he would always collect the right amounts for tickets issued and turn these over to the proper officials he was abused by his fellow workers, most of whom were dishonest in their work. It was quickly noticed that the brother was collecting far more than any others had done, and an investigation was made. The faithfulness of the Witness was noted, and it resulted in his receiving a fine letter of recommendation from the traffic manager. In part the letter reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Quite apart from the fact that you have proved the rumors to be facts, you have also inadvertently established yourself as a true and faithful civil servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I therefore have the pleasure to convey to you my sincere congratulations for being exceptionally honest and trustworthy in the discharge of your duties.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Copies of this letter went to various railway officials and this gave the brother excellent opportunities to give the glory to Jehovah. One official noted </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the brother was carrying and remarked that he formerly had no use for Jehovah’s witnesses but that he has now changed his mind. He asked for a copy of the magazine, and his attention was pointed to the article ‘‘Be Honest in Everything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus declared that anyone who would “keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness,” would not need to worry about material things, but that “all these other things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33) Those who take up the full-time ministry often have their faith in this statement of Jesus tested. Do they really believe that Jehovah will provide material needs for those who seek Kingdom interests first? A brother assigned as a special pioneer minister reported: “About five weeks later I became penniless. I found it hard to place even a small booklet, and I was compelled by hunger to cook and eat a bunch of unripe bananas.” The circuit minister for the area visited the congregation, and the brother wondered if he should complain about his circumstances and quit or go on seeking first the Kingdom. He continued: “I warmly engaged in the week’s activity as if I was the happiest man in the world.” What a great blessing followed! The pioneer contacted some interested ones that very week and was able to distribute four books and over twenty-five magazines and booklets, for which the interested ones were glad to contribute. As the pioneer said: “It happened as if Jehovah placed the books for me.” The brother is still enjoying the full-time ministry and having good results in the territory. Faith in the promise Jesus gave was not in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit minister was walking to a certain section of town for a day’s preaching activity. In order to redeem the time, he and his companion offered Bible magazines to those whom they met on the way. They met a man who took three magazines willingly and then stood still, staring after the pair for some time. His curiosity aroused, the circuit minister inquired why the man was just standing like that. The man responded: “I was a publisher like you about two years ago. There were three of us, all fleshly brothers, but the other two died and I became afraid so I stopped associating.” The circuit minister reasoned with him by asking if the other two had died faithful to God. The man said, “Yes.” The minister replied: “Then they have an assured hope of a resurrection into the new order of things that Jehovah is establishing. But now that you have left, where will you be at that time? Would not you like to be reunited with your two brothers again?” The inactive one’s home address was obtained and a call later made. He was given encouragement through a Bible study and soon came to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and began to have a share in preaching the good news about Jehovah’s kingdom again. He was happy to be back associating with God’s people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It takes patience and endurance on the part of both the teacher and the student before the learner progresses to the point of taking a stand for the truth. Several years ago a study was dropped when it became clear that the man was not willing to discontinue living in polygamy in order to come into God’s New World society. However, after a time, the study was restarted with the man’s senior wife. This sincere woman made good progress, even though of limited education. She eventually reached the point of wanting to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. Then the man, realizing that she was serious about her intentions, began to dissuade her. Pointing to her limited education, he began to mock her with: “What have you learned from all the meetings you’ve attended? Why, you hardly know any French!” Imagine his surprise when she proceeded to tell him. Although not able to read the French Bible, she covered the doctrines and pointed out things they had been doing that were out of harmony with the law of God. For all this she gave support by referring to the Bible chapters where he could look for verification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To further discourage her, the man sent his wife away to her village, out of contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. This only succeeded in spreading the “good news,” as the woman talked with all whom she met about her new-found faith in God. After a time the man relented and allowed her to come to attend an assembly because of her persuasive argument, “Was it not you who once said to me that, if any religion is right, it is Jehovah’s witnesses?” This persevering student was baptized at the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A schoolteacher questioned a young student about his refusal to salute the flag. It was explained from the Bible that Jehovah’s witnesses consider such to be an act of worship and that we should worship only Almighty God. The boy showed that, while the Witnesses respect the law of the land and obey the authorities, they could not violate their conscience by breaking Bible principles. This only provoked the teacher into beating the boy to unconsciousness. He, and eleven other students, all children of Jehovah’s witnesses, were expelled from school, and some parents and relatives were arrested by police and soldiers. Some were badly treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A group of alert brothers were able to contact ministers and officials of government about the situation. On December 8, 1964, a cabinet meeting was held in which the president of the country condemned the action taken against the young children. He is reported to have said that he has known Jehovah’s witnesses for more than ten years and that they are a people who are willing to die for their faith. He said that Jehovah’s witnesses should be left alone to follow their religious conscience, and that they do no harm to the country. Two prominent government officials were dispatched to the scene and this resulted in the release of all imprisoned ones and the return of the children to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a marvelous victory for Jehovah over the enemies of his people. A good witness to the faith of Jehovah’s people was given as a result of this incident, and all the children and others remained faithful throughout. Not one compromised. As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> seventeenyear-old schoolgirl put it: “I prayed incessantly during my detention [at the army camp] that Jehovah might protect me and that I might stay faithful to him. I do not hate my persecutors. I am determined to serve Jehovah better than before.” The four relatives who were rough-handled by soldiers did not bear any grudge against them, and said: “We preached to the guards while in the prison and arranged Bible studies with two of them who showed greater interest,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local Kingdom Hall has become overcrowded, as many attend meetings due to the prominence given this case. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy for this fine victory for freedom of worship, but they do not go about boasting over what happened. They continue to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece have enjoyed their grand privilege of preaching the Word of God during the past year. Toward the end of the year the political situation became extremely complicated in Greece. For more than two months there was great uneasiness in the governmental offices. There were strikes and demonstrations and extensive disturbances in the city of Athens. It appeared to many to be just short of an actual revolution. However, under these trying conditions the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom continued and the brothers enjoyed a 5-percent increase in the number of those who took up the proclamation of the good news. The greatest pleasure the brothers in Greece had was attending the assembly in Vienna. Here is a report on it and other matters from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most outstanding feature of the year for us was the Vienna assembly, where, for the first time, after a period of about forty years, the Greek brothers enjoyed fully a live-day assembly program in their language. In spite of many difficulties in having passports issued, the brothers had begun to prepare well ahead of time. A special railway train of twelve wagons full of brothers and sisters started from Athens for Vienna. As it was fittingly described, it was a “moving Kingdom Hall.” A tremendous witness was given all the way through the country to the Yugoslavian frontier and thence to Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blessings enjoyed by the approximately 1,250 Greek brothers attending the Vienna assembly increased their appreciation of the importance and spiritual utility of the assemblies provided by Jehovah’s organization. AU of them came back overloaded with blessed impressions, and they channeled with enthusiasm the spirit of the “Word of Truth” Assembly to their respective congregations here. As the news and spirit of the assembly were spread to the congregations during the day-long “excursional assemblies” in woods and other peaceful shore locations, the question on everyone’s lips was, “When will an assembly be held again?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another glad point in our ministry this year was in April, when 1,155 brothers and sisters worked as vacation pioneers in comparison with 623 who worked as such in April the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer, working with his wife, started a Eible study with a lady after many efforts. This lady procured a Bible, but she wanted to hear from her priest whether the book was good and if she should read it. The priest who saw the Bible told her that it is a good book and that she should read it. Then the lady said: “Yes, but this Bible calls God by the name Jehovah, and I don’t know what to do.” Then the priest told her: “If this name bothers you, just delete it.” The lady chose not to delete it, but continued her Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. She definitely erased from her mind the false religious doctrines and she is now a publisher of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the most unlikely circumstances may be the cause for arranging a Bible study. A brother found an envelope in the street with 1,000 drachmas and a family booklet in it. He immediately sent these things to the owner, whose name and address were shown in the booklet. Some days later the brother received a letter of appreciation from that man, who wrote him that he would send him a couple of chickens at the first opportunity as a token of gratitude. The brother answered immediately, telling him not to send the chickens but that he would visit him at home and then they could eat the chickens together. This was done. The brother called on the man, gave him a proper witness and started a Bible study right away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Our brothers in the French-speaking territories of the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and in South American French Guiana have many reasons to rejoice. The work has moved along very well in all three of these territories, and Jehovah’s witnesses have had some excellent results due to their teaching activity. The publishers of the Kingdom are giving the territories good coverage, and the people are taking notice that the ministers of God are very sincere in wanting to <a name="bookmark108"></a><a name="bookmark109"></a>bring them the message from God’s Word. Here are some experiences from the three locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Be a vacation pioneer, and then become a regular pioneer. As so many did last April, a sister became a vacation pioneer for one month. As a result, she wrote in: “I found in the field more fruit than during my sixteen years in the organization. It is the first time I have felt so much joy.” As a publisher, she said: “I had just one study that was not followed up as I would have liked, due to a lack of good scheduling of my time. But during my month as vacation pioneer, I learned how to schedule my time effectively, and when the month was over I had started seven home Bible studies. Yes, seven home Bible studies! But I said to myself, ‘How can I leave this wonderful fruit </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5"> have found? No, I can’t do so.’ Then I got the idea: If I could arrange a schedule to be out in the field service for one month, why not do so for the following months and become a regular pioneer? I talked it over with my husband, who is until now an unbeliever, but showing some interest in the truth, and explained my desire to continue as a pioneer. Imagine my happiness to have his approval!” As a result, she was again </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> vacation pioneer one month, and now she is a regular pioneer. In July she conducted eleven home Bible studies. She wrote, saying: “Dear brothers and sisters, know that the richest blessing you may have is to be a pioneer. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">am experiencing this even though we have a family of thirteen.” Is not that wonderful? Surely it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,505</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Watering” regularly is necessary to get results in our work. In fact, it is an essential factor in order to see Jehovah’s blessing upon our efforts, as the following experience shows clearly. In the little village of Remire, about eight miles from Cayenne, a man showed some interest in the truth. Even though a study was conducted for several years, there was no satisfactory result. In fact, he was not “watered” enough, at least not regularly. Moreover, secular work interfered; also, his friends took him along with them hunting and fishing. So the two special pioneers in Cayenne decided to travel these eight miles regularly to visit him and those with whom it would be possible to start a home Bible study. His interest in the truth grew more and more. Now he met opposition from his wife. However, with kindness and patience she was helped to see that this was also in her interests as well as for her family. She became so interested a few months later that now she is the one who eagerly encourages her husband to study. As a result, not only did both take their stand for the truth by becoming publishers of the good news, but the children are studying too. They were taken away from the Catholic school where they attended, and the oldest one has started in the field service. Moreover, a service center has been established there now, and each Tuesday about twenty people meet, including the children and this couple plus two other interested persons who have manifested their desire to symbolize by baptism at the next assembly that they have dedicated their lives to Jehovah. Certainly we have here a strong proof that in order to get the blessing from Jehovah upon our work we have to “water” regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MARTINIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;292,062</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 204 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,432</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Witnessing with patience to our relatives can bring good results, as is shown by the following experience from a sister. She writes: “My sister-in-law and I were both fervent Catholics. We followed our religion with much sincerity, loving and fearing God. There was no thought of one day changing our religion, as we were fully convinced we were on the right path. Then one day everything changed when my fleshly sister, who had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, came to pay us a visit. Of course, she talked about the Word of truth, the Bible. She came several times and, as you can imagine, ‘the fight’ was very hard. However, each time after her departure my sister-in-law and I would talk about what had just been discussed and, little by little, I came to see that what was said by my fleshly sister had a ring of truth. Then one day at the conclusion of a Biblical conversation, I said to my sister-in-law: ‘Well, I do not say I will change my religion, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font5">tell you, my sister is right.’ Quickly the reply came: ‘You have already been overcome, my dear, to speak like that!’ From that day on I started to search the Bible. My sister kept on coming and successfully started a home Bible study with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In turn, I showed the same loving patience toward my sister-in-law, who was then living in our home, trying to share with her my new knowledge. But I was snubbed each time. I did not get discouraged, but, rather, I patiently took each favorable occasion to help her with the truth. I kept on praying to Jehovah to open her mind to understand it. When she left our home to live on her own, I began to pay her visits as my fleshly sister used to do previously for me. But in order to keep peace with her, before talking on a Biblical subject, I would ask her permission to give a little sermon from the Bible. This had the result of not. closing her mind toward what would be said, as she had agreed to talk on such a subject. I felt that she was not insensible to the words of God as much as she seemed to indicate. Each time the Bible was taken as the basis of our discussions. Then suddenly I saw my patience starting to be rewarded, and finally a Bible study was started. You can imagine how I expressed my gratefulness to Jehovah when, only three months later, she took her first steps into the field service! Even better! She is now a dedicated and baptized Christian, yes, a sheep of Jehovah’s pasture, and this because loving patience was shown.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GUATEMALA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,278,473</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,366 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,132</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each year brings added blessings to Jehovah’s witnesses in Guatemala. This is the first time that the publishers there spent a total of over 300,000 hours in the field service. This in itself made the Kingdom publishers rejoice. A special effort was put forth during the year to work some isolated towns, and now some of the interested persons are forming into groups and getting organized into small congregations. What the brothers in Guatemala would like is more active leadership by overseers, individuals who have a deep appreciation for the truth and can help others to grow to maturity. All of this will come in time as each one continues to assemble together and not neglect the house of his God. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant of Guatemala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lad of eighteen years, raised by his mother, visited his father for the first time. The father, now one of Jehovah’s witnesses, invited his son to live with him temporarily. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> Bible study was conducted regularly with the son, and in four months he began to publish. Each Sunday he would participate in the preaching work and, during the week when work was scarce in the garage where he was employed, he would ask for time off to accompany a pioneer minister. Ten months after first hearing the Kingdom message he symbolized his dedication to Jehovah. He changed jobs in order to give more time to the ministry, working in a bakery at night, sleeping in the morning and preaching in the afternoons. Later, he was able to serve three months as a vacation pioneer by always seeking secular work that allowed the most time for the ministry. How happy our young minister was when he reached his twenty-first birthday to accept an invitation to serve as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">special pioneer in isolated territory! How wise it is for youths to seek full-time service to Jehovah and not full-time work for a system that cannot endure!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> can sometimes produce a Kingdom publisher and spread the truth where it has not been preached before. A circuit servant, the second week after returning from Gilead, journeyed by bus and then traveled by horseback for three and a half hours to reach an isolated interested person. Three years earlier this man had subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> just before moving to the mountains for health reasons and had given his new address, which was over a hundred miles away. The mail service delivered the magazine to this isolated place over fifty miles from the nearest Witness. The subscriber read the words of life and began to correspond with the branch office. A pioneer couple had made the first back-call months earlier and had placed the first bound volumes of the Society in his hands and had shown him how to study and how to teach others. Now the circuit servant was following up the interest, and nine persons attended his Bible lecture. After a few days the visiting minister had to travel on, but he was encouraged by his host’s promise to attend the district assembly to symbolize his dedication to Jehovah. This he did, and after four days of association with the brothers, he said: “Now I am going to preach the good news of the Kingdom as a true witness of Jehovah. I now know that these are the people of the true God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,384,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,256 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,694</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Haiti have followed the counsel of the apostle Paul that anyone who is being orally taught the Word should share in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching. (Gal. 6:6) This has been proved true through the teaching program that is carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses among those persons who cannot read and write. Those who are orally taught and who understand Jehovah’s purposes can, of course, preach. But the time comes when they want to read and grow in understanding and knowledge. Many persons in some of the countries of the world where illiteracy is prevalent have appreciated what Jehovah’s witnesses do in teaching the truth of God’s Word and also in teaching others how to read and write. Here are some experiences that the branch servant in Haiti sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the year was the national “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assembly held in Port-au-Prince, the capital city, in March. There were 1,979 persons in attendance for the public talk, and 53 were baptized. In addition to that, in May we held a circuit assembly in Port-au-Prince. The meetings were held in a beautiful hall one block from the National Palace, and we have had good cooperation from the local authorities. One policeman who was appointed to maintain order during the sessions made this remark to a brother: “You don’t need me here, but I would like to stay all my life with you. You are a neat and peaceful people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much progress has been made, not only in covering new territory and in the number of publishers preaching the good news, but also in improving the quality and efficiency of these ministers. Much of the credit for this goes to the reading school that is being conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses in every congregation and isolated group here. A circuit servant in the south of the country writes this about the reading school: “The reading school has aided the nucleus of publishers in N----very much. In fact, eleven persons are enrolled</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">in the reading school class. Three can read and write correctly and conduct studies in the homes of the people. Four have begun to read and others already know all the letters in the alphabet. One who learned to read in the reading class shared in a demonstration at our last circuit assembly. Everyone in attendance was surprised, since they knew she spent about twenty years as a Baptist without learning how to read, and she had associated only two years with the Witnesses and already she could read. This little group grew from eight publishers in November to thirteen in August.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;760,598</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,218 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 343</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Hawaii feel that they have many reasons to say as did the psalmist: “You have crowned the year with your goodness.” It was good because the ministers of the good news spoke to people of so many different kinds of religion. In addition to meeting with many persons of Babylonish religion and arousing their interest, there is materialism to contend with. Many are the blessings, however, of the publishers of the Kingdom because they give themselves wholeheartedly to the declaring of the good news. Fine experiences are set out here from the Hawaiian Islands and also from the Marshall Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A fine increase in the number of publishers who vacation pioneered throughout the year was enjoyed. In April there was a total of 266 vacation pioneers, representing 12 percent of the total publishers in Hawaii. In one congregation the entire servant body vacation pioneered in April; this unit reported sixty-eight vacation pioneers that month, which was 58 percent of the total publishers in the congregation. To make it possible for many of the mothers with small children to vacation pioneer, some sisters opened up their homes as nurseries and provided baby-sitting assistance. Others offered diaper service for the vacation pioneer mothers with small children. One sister, sixty-eight years of age, had never vacation pioneered before. Due to her age and physical handicap of deafness, she said afterward: “I didn’t think I would make it.” However, she was able to go out every day in April, putting in a total of 108 hours, and she looks forward to vacation pioneering again in the future. Her health improved greatly that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister made a back-call on a woman who was very busy ironing, but she listened to the sermon and renewed her </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscription. A Bible study was arranged and she studied regularly and made steady progress. After about eighteen months of study, she was encouraged to make public declaration of the things she had learned in her studies. She did incidental witnessing to her neighbor and was thrilled that she listened to the message and desired to look into the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sister accompanied her on the next call and arranged for a home Bible study. The neighbor always prepared well for the study and soon started to share the good things learned with her husband and children. Being a Catholic, the husband immediately began to oppose her, not wanting any other religion in the home. He ordered his wife to stop the study, began coming home drunk and quarreling with her. One day he threw her down the stairway, and she was confined for three days to the hospital. When she consulted her mother and friends for advice on the problem, they advised her to leave her husband and live with her mother. Later, when the husband asked the wife what she intended to do, she replied: “I’m going to stay here and take care of the family. Since the Bible says a believer of the true God Jehovah should not leave her mate, my desire is to follow the Bible principles, even though it means enduring hardship from my family and friends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of her standing firm for the truth and applying its principles in her life, her husband manifested interest and is now studying with his wife and children. She has now joined her neighbor in preaching in midweek activity, has enrolled in the ministry school and is enjoying it very much. Both are also continuing to witness to their friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An enjoyable highlight of the year was having Brother Knorr with us for our all-islands assembly. It proved to be a real stimulus to the brothers, and a very effective witness was given. Fine comments complimenting the conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses were heard from the police, businessmen and hotel owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Toward the close of the year a new literature storage building was constructed by the brothers, and it will prove to be a fine asset to the work here in giving good service to the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MARSHALL ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,363</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,929</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A good increase in the work in the Marshall Islands took place this year, and now there are two missionaries there to aid the local publishers. The Marshallese people are very receptive to the truth, and will usually stop what they are doing, invite you into the house, get their Bibles and willingly discuss the Scriptures with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In less than two months over a hundred </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">books have been placed and the two missionaries are conducting about twenty Bible studies each. Since much interest exists, many studies are being combined so that more persons can be reached with Bible studies. Many are so impressed with the hope of living in an earthly paradise that they tell their neighbors all the truths they have learned thus far. These, in turn, often desire to have a Bible study, and the missionaries are frequently stopped while going from house to house and are asked to ‘come teach us the Bible.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To help the Marshallese, of whom very few speak English, the publishers make simple translations from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and type carbon copies, which are handed out for the study and then collected at the end of the study to be used next time. To encourage them to study ahead, they are asked to look up the scriptures in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book for the next week’s lesson, reading these in their Marshallese Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people are just waiting for someone to come and teach them the Bible. We are hopeful that some publishers will be able to arrange their affairs to move here to serve where the need is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The vacation pioneer work gave the brothers in Honduras a wonderful opportunity to do what Paul wrote to the Ephesians about: ‘Buy out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.’ (Eph. 5:16) Of the 804 publishers in Honduras, 162 joined in the vacation pioneer work sometime during the past service year. Of course, because of this a much greater witness was given throughout Honduras, and this has made glad the hearts of all the publishers there. The branch servant sends in some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should be alert to call back on all persons who give indications of a right heart, whether we place literature with them or not, or even if they seem firmly set in their religion. One of our special pioneers that showed empathy called on a Catholic man who invited her in and enjoyed her sermon, but he said that he was firmly set in his Catholic faith and that he would never change his religion. The sister recognized his feeling and plainly stated that, as they both believed in God, it was also necessary to know his Word and that was her purpose in visiting, to explain God’s Word. The man said that he had never read God’s Word but the priest explained it in church and that was enough. However, he did consent to let the sister call back on him. On the return call a study was started in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and she brought along the Catholic Bible. What was the result? Well, God’s Word “is alive and exerts power,’’ and when this man saw exactly what the Bible itself contained he was surprised and showed great indignation toward his Catholic faith, as it had hidden from him the truths from God’s Word. He immediately stopped going to mass, although he previously attended every morning at six o’clock. He said that he was through listening to lies and removed all the images from his house and began attending the congregational meetings, taking his family with him. But his relatives were violently opposed; in fact, his carnal brother told him that, if he did not stop attending Jehovah’s witnesses’ meetings, he would disown him as a brother and would hate him. His wife responded to this threat: “It is written that we would be hated and even killed for the sake of our faith.” What faith they have, although they began to study just recently! This family of five is now very happy and grateful that this special pioneer sister called on them and then returned although no literature was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more the need to care for isolated interest by means of letter writing is being called to our attention. It can bring joyous results, as seen by this experience: A sister, who herself lives in isolated territory, was left a home Bible study by her fleshly brother. She was very conscientious and began to correspond, as this interested person lived some distance away. A study was faithfully held in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and continued for ten months. Then time for the Memorial came and a special letter was prepared directing the person to God’s organization. What a surprise to the sister when, by return mail, she learned that this person had read about the Memorial in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and had been making plans to attend, although she did not know where it would be held. What a joy was hers to attend her first meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses! In fact, it was not enough for her. She wanted to stay three days more with the sister to learn more about the preaching work and so carry on the spreading of the “good news” in her own territory. As she is under age, a telegram was sent to her mother asking permission for her to stay three days more, explaining the reason and stating that the Witnesses would take her home. Three days of training ensued. Both the sister and the interested person were getting to know each other for the first time and then, on top of it all, they were sharing in the ministry together. After three days this new publisher returned home with a companion, and a witness was given in her own town. Three more months passed and it was time for the circuit assembly. She had talked of baptism, and now was the opportune time. She was written to and encouraged to attend. With joy she said that she would be there, but just a few days before the assembly she took ill and said that she could not attend. What a surprise to all when, on Saturday afternoon, she appeared and was baptized, symbolizing her dedication. She is now faithfully shepherding the “sheep” in her own territory, faithfully caring for interested persons as she was once cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,700,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The majority of people in Hong Kong place the highest values in life on material things and their own well-being and progress. The present is what they are thinking about, not the future. So the message of God’s kingdom and the new order of things that will exist does not have very much appeal. However, during the past year Jehovah’s witnesses have been very active among all the Chinese people, preaching the good news of God’s established kingdom, and they get a hearing ear from time to time. In the midst of these millions of people only 398 have time to consider the Bible in a home Bible study. This has not discouraged God’s people, as they know that the discipling work must go on. The branch office in Hong Kong gives us items of interest from Hong Kong, Macao and China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">August is the month when the schools close for summer vacation, and Jehovah’s witnesses make good use of this time to tell others about the good news. This year twenty-nine arranged their affair’s to share in the vacation pioneer work. One of them, a mother of six with a husband not in the truth, learned how a good practical schedule could help her to care for family responsibilities and have a share in the vacation pioneer work. She arranged her schedule so that the children could help with home duties and she could spend more time in the field. How happy this sister was when at the end of the month her report showed that she had reached all her goals! And what a difference this month of concentrated activity has made to her efficiency as a minister!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of telling the truth to all we have contact with can clearly be seen from the following experience: Some years ago an elderly Chinese woman went to work as a servant for a family of Jehovah’s witnesses. At first, she attended meetings to look after the baby while the mother or father were on the platform giving talks or demonstrations. Later, a study was started with her, but due to limited education progress was slow. However, she was diligent in her study and has made progress to the point of being </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> regular publisher, meeting her ten-hour goal and placing twelve magazines each month. But the greatest joy came at the recent circuit assembly when she stood up to be baptized in symbol of her dedication. How thankful that family are that they spoke the truth to their servant!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of many attempts to make contact with our brothers in China during the past year, we have not received one letter. One piece of news received indirectly indicates they are very closely watched and not able to do much as regards preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On October 12 we received word through the Foreign Office in London, England, that Stanley Jones would be released from prison on the 13th of October. On the 15th of October the Society received this word: “Foreign Office says Jones will be crossing from Schumchun to Hong Kong Sunday morning.” Before this report went to press we learned that Brother Jones was with his brothers in Hong Kong on October 17, 1965, after living for seven years in a Chinese Communist prison. We await a report from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MACAO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;375,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">For the past year two special pioneers have done good work in this Portuguese colony. The work has gone ahead well, but the preaching activity has not gone unnoticed by the Catholic church. Articles appeared in the Catholic weekly newspaper warning all not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses. But the work continued to grow and as many as fourteen met together for the weekly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. However, the Portuguese police got to know of the location of the study. One Sunday afternoon they entered the home when the study was being held, took all the literature and Bibles and deported the two special pioneers. In spite of this setback, the publishers there seem determined to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190,230</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in this cold northern island of Iceland made fine progress with the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom during the past service year. More than 27,000 hours were spent in that work, and 104 Bible studies were conducted during the past year. The congregation publishers, pioneers and special pioneers are meeting their goals in the distribution of magazines. Thus another good witness has been given. Here is a very interesting experience sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over the years many efforts have been made to reach the various isolated territories in Iceland, not only to place literature, but to find the “other sheep” in these places and help them to make progress in the truth. Some five and a half years ago such an effort was made in connection with the northwestern peninsula, which is a real fiord-country with steep and inaccessible mountains, far away from the capital, Reykjavik. Two young and energetic special pioneers assigned to this territory worked hard there for about three years, placing much literature and trying to sow the seed of truth as widely as possible before they had to leave. However, no results seemed to be forthcoming during all this time, and we wondered whether these efforts had just been wasted. To find out, one of the pioneers who had stayed there formerly went to the place once more this summer together with the circuit servant to show the new moving picture and try to stir up interest in the message of God’s kingdom. How happy they were to see that the seed of truth they had sown years ago had now begun to sprout, as one of the persons with whom they had conducted a study long ago had done quite a lot of preaching on his own, to workmates, friends and acquaintances. As a result of this, a young fisherman had gotten interested enough to write to the Society’s branch office to get all the literature available in Icelandic plus a subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He really recognized the voice of the Fine Shepherd and manifested much interest, especially after having seen the moving picture shown by the brothers. He had many questions from reading the literature he had received, besides another question, which made the brothers very happy: “What shall I do to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” He is now planning to leave this isolated place, together with his brother, to move south to Reykjavik in order to contact the congregation there to learn more of Jehovah’s wonderful purpose and his kingdom which is soon to usher in a new order of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 480,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,044 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 234,834</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conditions in this part of the world just now certainly make the world wonder what will happen during the coming twelve months. Jehovah’s witnesses do not have to wonder, because their knowledge of the Bible makes them free from worry and anxious care. They place their trust in Jehovah despite the world situation. Of course, the situation that exists brings many difficulties upon Jehovah’s witnesses, especially those with children of school age, because when nations are disturbed, as India is, the patriotic fervor must be aroused and this proves to be a test, as it is for many of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world. Let us read the report as it comes from the branch servant in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year I mentioned the problem we were facing over the national-anthem issue. This continues to test the Christian neutrality and integrity of some of the brothers and their school-age children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This past month the Kerala State government started investigation as to the reasons why our children refuse participation in the anthem ceremonies. They have asked, What is behind it all? Police have attended circuit assemblies and interrogated some of the brothers. Brother Funk, district servant, happened to be in Kerala at the time and so was able to give authentic information to the police, and on his suggestion I wrote to the Inspector-General of Police, Government of Kerala, briefly explaining the Society’s reasons, and sent him three copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> containing articles dealing with court cases in the U.S.A, on this subject. Apart from this we have enjoyed full freedom for the Kingdom work and there has been no official interference with any feature of our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother not long in the truth moved to a remote place in the jungle of north Malabar. He wrote to the branch office, so we sent his address to the circuit servant and arrangements were made for this isolated brother to meet the circuit servant at the nearest railway station some twenty miles away. There was no transportation to his house so they walked the whole twenty miles. The following day they set out to see an interested neighbor four miles away. This man plied them with questions about saying prayers to Mary and other Roman Catholic teachings and practices. This was about a year ago. After four months the circuit servant visited this area again. The man who had asked the questions told the brother that he had ceased praying to Mary as soon as he had left on the previous occasion, and now there were no statues or religious pictures to be seen in his house. At </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">meeting in the man’s house an opponent turned up, saying Jehovah’s witnesses were false prophets. The circuit servant showed him 1 John 4:1 and invited him to stay and listen to his talk that evening and then decide who were the false prophets. Now there are four publishers regularly reporting field service from that jungle area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers are doing a fine work. Last year I reported that one had spent his vacation working some unassigned territory. This year he did the same, with similarly excellent results. Another special pioneer, while on vacation, witnessed in a small village far away from any of Jehovah’s witnesses, but aroused the interest of some schoolteachers. A report of this was sent to the branch office, and the circuit servant went there with a brother who could speak the local language and found the nucleus of a congregation already formed. The leader among the schoolteachers had acquired the Society’s current study aids and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and was now ready for action. On arrival at the small railway station the circuit servant found some eager faces awaiting him. They took our two brothers in an oxcart across a mere cart track the two and a half miles to the village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There they found the place all decorated with colored paper streamers to welcome them. It was only a village of some 120 houses, but they were all “Christians.” That evening a meeting was held in the little church building and almost all the village turned out. The following day was spent showing these eager schoolteachers how we do our preaching and how we conduct our Bible studies. More meetings were held in the church building, and by this time the people were being divided for and against this “new teaching.” Two boys of about eight years of age were heard conversing with each other: “Jehovah’s witnesses say that Christ is not God.” “Yes, they are right because the Bible says so.” “But Christ is God.” “Isn’t Christ the Son of God?” “Yes, but still he is God; they are one.” “Who came first?” “Christ.” “How does the Son come before his Father?” “Oh! So Jehovah’s witnesses must be right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Youths can make a stand for truth! A boy of thirteen began to have a Bible study with a special pioneer and started doing some witnessing. His father was angry and beat him. When the boy could stand it no longer, he ran away from home and went to one of the local publishers. He stayed the night, but the next day the publisher took him back home and had a long talk with the father of the boy. He relented, and now the boy is saving his pennies to buy a new Bible and subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He participates in field service regularly now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a circuit assembly a visiting delegate stayed with relatives who lived in town. Being Roman Catholics, they had never listened to the message of the Kingdom when local Witnesses called at that house. Now they did listen to their own relative and began to take notice. Only Gospel portions are available in the Indian language understood by these people, and the Gospel of Luke was left with them. Later, a priest visited them and they gave him the copy of Luke, only to learn afterward that he had burned it. The priest told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves, being educated persons, listening to those “sweepers” and low-class people. The householder replied: “But Jesus did, and the religious leaders of his day said the same thing about Jesus as you are saying to us.” The priest stopped calling at their home; their children were taken away from the Catholic school and the householder lost his job with a Roman Catholic employer, but he remained firm. Nuns from the school visited the home and told the mother that they ought to put their Bible in the oven. They now write, saying: “We are now benefiting eternally from God’s own Book.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Despite much opposition in all parts of the territory that Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to work, in Indonesia, still the Witnesses have enjoyed a 21-percent increase. The hard-working group of special pioneers, along with pioneers and congregation publishers, have done remarkably well in their hours spent in the field service and in their Bible-study activity. The zeal and sincerity that they show will bring joy to the hearts of everyone devoted to God. Here are some unusual but real experiences from this land where the need for more ordained ministers is great. The report is given by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past service year highlighted the appropriateness of the year’s text. Strenuous efforts were made by religious opposers to stop Jehovah’s witnesses. The branch received several reports of mob attacks on brothers in various parts of the country. A number of special pioneers were beaten up in the course of their ministry. The tiny town of Biak, West Irian, was the scene of one outrage. Two special pioneers were making good headway, and this aroused the Protestant clergy, who have a virtual religious monopoly on the island. Four of the town’s clergymen and approximately sixty elders of the various churches in town mobbed the house of an interested person where the first </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study was being held. When the special pioneers and the house owner went out to ascertain the cause of the disturbance, the mob broke down the fence and attacked the three brothers. All were injured. One of the special pioneers was knocked unconscious and then savagely kicked by the presiding clergyman. The twenty-four interested persons in attendance at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study did not draw back after witnessing this violence but became more convinced that their former clergymen were representatives of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergyman who instigated this riot later visited another island where two families of Jehovah’s witnesses had recently moved and built homes. After preaching an inflammatory sermon against the brothers, he led the congregation out of the church to the homes of the two brothers and destroyed their homes, leaving twelve persons without a dwelling. The brothers have remained faithful under these adversities and have kept preaching despite threats of murder by the religious mobsters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the island of Kalimantan (Borneo) comes an interesting account of the results of witnessing en route home from a convention. Two special pioneers traveling home by riverboat to their inland assignment stopped a night in a river village to await another boat. They contacted a lay preacher of the Protestant church who expressed himself as being an opposer of Jehovah’s witnesses due to having read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> a few years previously. He had taken particular exception to the chapter on the trinity. A discussion of the trinity doctrine quickly had the preacher floundering for support of his belief. Later in the evening he visited the home where the pioneers were staying to pursue the discussion further. Bible texts were checked until three o’clock in the morning. A year passed and the pioneers had almost forgotten the event when they were surprised to find the man on their doorstep, having traveled by riverboat for a day and a night to meet them. He informed the pioneers that he had not been able to get the discussion with them out of his mind. He had reread </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> again and again since then and attempted to get satisfying answers and proof for the trinity, first from his presiding clergyman and, when he failed to provide convincing answers, from the presiding synod of the church. The synod could present nothing to combat what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> said. “So,” continued the visitor to the pioneers, “I am here to find out what I have to do to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” He produced a copy of a letter he had recently sent the synod resigning as a preacher and a member of the church because “I can no longer teach or accept doctrines that are untrue.” After several days of intensive study he returned to his village to preach the truth. Soon the circuit servant visited and together they called from house to house in the neighboring villages. The former preacher began at each house by apologizing for having formerly taught the householder lies and expressing his joy that he could now bring them the truth. He is preparing to be baptized at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A congregation servant in Java makes good use of the opportunities presented in his secular work as headmaster of a high school. He opened an extra course for any of his students who desired Bible lessons. The class was well attended, though the students were all Islam by religion. As the children progressed in Bible knowledge the parents became alarmed and forbade them to attend these lessons. The teacher visited the parents of each and discussed the spiritual educational work of Jehovah’s witnesses. He was able to encourage many of the parents to continue permitting their children to receive this valuable knowledge. As these students progressed a special </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">study and ministry school were arranged for their benefit. Over a period of two years nineteen pupils have become publishers and nine have been baptized. Five have been vacation pioneers. This congregation enjoyed a 59-percent increase in the last six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many are the opportunities for preaching with magazines. A sister, the wife of a district ruler, places as many as twenty magazines a day with visitors who come to see her husband on official business. The husband at first objected strongly to his wife’s activity as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, in view of their position in the community, but he has now come to accept her working from house to house and placing literature with those waiting to see him at their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,551,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 98 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 26,037</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through immigration there is a steady increase in the population of Israel, so that there are always more people from all nations to whom to witness. Steadily but slowly the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in this land grows, and we have two good groups established, one in Tel Aviv and the other in Haifa. Besides these two congregations we have some scattered publishers living throughout the country. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is published in the Hebrew language in Israel and this supplies the Hebrew-speaking brothers with spiritual food. The branch servant gives this interesting report about what is going on in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the new ones who started out in the ministry during the year, we were very happy to see the return of some ‘prodigal sons,’ after a break of some years without activity or association. A family from South America settled in a town over thirty miles from the nearest congregation. Partial isolation and other factors caused them to fall away three years ago despite encouragement and visits from the brothers. Throughout the time of their absence, relatives in Argentina continued to encourage them by correspondence, even letters between the children including exhortations to start association again with the New World society. This continued interest in their spiritual welfare and the workings of their own consciences stirred them to do something about the situation. A letter to Spanish-speaking brothers in the nearest congregation led to an immediate visit. An evening of happy discussions and studies together was enjoyed and the next morning the restored brother packed a literature bag ready to accompany his visitors from house to house in the ministry. He enjoyed a full share and quickly regained his old enthusiasm. Since then the whole family of mother, father and three young children travel for an hour each way once or twice each week in order to be at the meetings. Their “return” has been a source of encouragement to those who were sorry to see them leave “home” three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One more instance is of an Arabic family in which the husband started to study and associate with the congregation some years ago. The wife’s opposition and her recruitment of help from the local Catholic Legion of Mary group led to his becoming confused in mind, completely irreligious and very worldly in his way of life. The troubles that his wayward conduct caused at home made the wife wish that she had never interfered with his studies. The sharp contrast between his conduct and attitude while formerly studying the Bible, and afterward, convinced her that there was something worth while in such studies after all. When the brothers called in their area recently, she immediately requested that someone come again to resume the study. Fine progress has been made by them both. They bring their children to the meetings and recently opened their home as a place for meetings too. Now there is a happy spirit in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lonely widow here in Israel wrote to a newspaper in Germany, requesting that someone write her with a view to regular correspondence. She received many replies but was particularly attracted by the one written by a sister in Germany. She replied, and a regular Bible study was established by mail. In view of her interest, her address was passed along to the branch office here with the request that someone who speaks German go out to see her. Now the study is conducted in her own home and a fine appreciation for the truth has developed. Her home is in such an out-of-the-way place that it is most unlikely that she would have been contacted in house-to-house calls. Jehovah God has other ways of bringing the message of truth to the attention of sheeplike ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;52,596,365</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,585 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,487</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people in Italy are continually fleeing from Babylon the Great and are associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. People see that the world empire of false religion has nothing for them, and once they learn the truth they are filled with joy the same as all of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world. It is a source of encouragement to note the enthusiasm of the brothers in Italy in their preaching activity. They fully appreciate the need of taking in knowledge and they do not neglect the house of their God. The branch servant gives us these experiences, including a report from Libya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine is helping many persons to know and follow the truth. While in bed an interested person who had been studying for only a few months was reading the article “Let’s Clean House, Religiously Speaking,” in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> As she herself relates: “I could hardly wait to get up in order to clean house the following morning.” The next morning she actually took down all the images she had in the house. Since that moment she has made real progress in the truth and has recently begun to take part in preaching the Kingdom. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher started a Bible study with an old fellow worker. During the first visit the husband and his four children listened, but his wife continued with her housework. On the second visit the wife said that she had once studied with Jehovah’s witnesses but then stopped because her husband tore up the magazines, hid her books and took her to church in order to make her forget about studying God’s Word, and sometimes he even beat her. So how could she agree to study with her husband when he was the one who had kept her away from the Bible? The publisher encouraged her by saying that one may make many mistakes in one’s life. What is really important, though, is to repent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of one’s errors and forgive each other. She did not accept this counsel. Meanwhile, her husband wondered how he would be able to convince his wife to study with him. However, not much time went by before his wife started asking some questions and later joined in the study. A fleshly brother of the wife is a friar, and every year he comes to pay them a visit. When he came, his sister talked to him about the Bible and pointed out that God’s name is Jehovah. In opposition he turned to her husband, telling him that his wife could not interpret the Bible, thinking that her husband was of the same opinion as he. But this time the husband knew the truth and told him that his wife was right. At this the friar got angry and said he would not come back to visit them anymore. Now the entire family takes part in the study and the husband has already been out in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interested person expressed his desire to study the Bible with the help of one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In spite of the fact that the Witness had to travel seventy kilometers every time to and from the study, the publisher decided to continue his efforts out of love for his neighbor. At one of such visits he found a number of persons, all the relatives, gathered together and was able to distribute three </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True” </span><span class="font5">books, two Bibles and obtain four subscriptions. One of the relatives present was a young woman who wanted to enter a convent, but now she became enthusiastic about the message of the Bible and with heartfelt thanks accepted the truth. She has had to move away from her family because of her job, but she continues to preach the truth and has found a person with whom to study the Bible. The elderly parents, however, became opposed and did not want their children to change their religion. They said that the Bibles the children used were false. Therefore the son took his father to the Catholic priest to ask the priest whether the Bibles were true or false. The young man brought a tape recorder with him in order to play back the conversation later to his wife. At first the priest objected to using the tape recorder, but the young man was insistent. The priest confirmed the fact that their Bibles were not false although they were without the “imprimatur” of the Catholic church, but he counseled that one should not attribute too much importance to the Bible as Jehovah’s witnesses do and that this was the mistake of the Witnesses. The father asked the priest to help him to bring his son back to the old religion, but, to the surprise of everyone, the priest said: “If your son believes he has been following the wrong road up to now, let him follow the right one now!” This young man and his family made progress in the knowledge of the truth and now they are getting ready to symbolize their dedication at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,570,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 48 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 32,708</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is encouraging to see how the brothers maintain their integrity and help others to know the Word of God in Libya, although the work is hindered. In fact, the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses was banned in this country as well as in other Arabic states under charge of being a Jewish organization. Letters and documents proving that Jehovah’s witnesses are Christians and therefore have no connection with Jewish political interests were sent to various departments of the Libyan government, but up to now no decision has been made to remove the ban. However, the brothers have taken a firm stand for the truth. Also, a number of persons are temporary residents in the land, and some of them, after they get the truth, go back to their own country, continuing zealously in the work of Jehovah. Recently a family who used to have a Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses and then quit studying in America was found in the regular house-to-house work, and now all the members of the family are studying the Bible. Much upbuilding was received by the brothers in Libya from the “Word of Truth” Assemblies held in Europe last summer. A good number of them were able to attend and get the rich spiritual information presented from the Bible, which they now can use to help still others in the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,758,803</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,355 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 328</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like most of the common people around the world, the people of Jamaica are deeply concerned about the turbulent conditions of the nations. It appears that every level of society has its troubles. Many people believe there is no answer and they are prepared to take what comes. However, some few, who listen to Jehovah’s witnesses when they call at their doors with the wonderful Kingdom message, see that the world scene will change and that there is really a hope for mankind. Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica “make known among the peoples his dealings. [They] make mention that his name is to be put on high.” (Isa. 12:4) The branch servant in Jamaica sends in experiences from Jamaica, Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An eleven-year-old Witness entered the vacation pioneer work in July. She thoughtfully invited the eigh-teen-year-old girl with whom she conducted a home Bible study to join her in the ministry, which she did on several occasions during this period. Her appreciation of the truth has been accelerated through these experiences, and now both are conducting regular home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was twelve years old when he was found discussing the truth with his elders. A twelve-year-old Jamaican boy was not talking but was listening to Bible discussions and was favorably impressed with what the Bible said about ‘witnessing’ and ‘witnesses.’ He started attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall, to the chagrin of his mother. She made it clear that he was not to attend again. He obeyed and so his only contact with the truth for some time was through an occasional magazine that his uncle would get from the Witnesses. One weekend he was visiting his grandmother and while he was there a publisher called at the home. He listened to the sermon and accepted the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet, which he read and reread, practically memorizing every word. He began witnessing to his mother, grandmother and aunt. His mother’s opposition softened. When his aunt moved to England, he continued encouraging her through correspondence to get in touch with the Witnesses and allow them to assist her to learn of God’s purposes. She did and is now dedicated. In the meantime he obtained </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font5"> studied it through himself, began attending meetings again and asked to be assisted in the field ministry. Today, at the age of twenty, he is a special pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The disciples of Jesus failed to catch fish on one side of the boat, so he told them to try the other side. They did, and succeeded. A sheeplike person might live near our home while we look elsewhere. A young lady whose parents were Jehovah’s witnesses did not pay particular attention to the truth while living at home. She left home seeking employment and located domestic work with a family of Witnesses. While this family looked for interested persons in other parts of the territory, they did not overlook ‘the other side of the boat’ right there in their home. A study was started with the girl, she was taken to the meetings regularly and today is a dedicated publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidental witnessing should not be overlooked. (Eccl. 11:6) Lasting impressions are often made when God’s Word is discussed. One sister tells that this was the case with her. While at school her teacher, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, encouraged her to read the Bible and witnessed to her periodically. After graduation she left home and noticed that people in general did not live by Bible principles. She wanted clean associates, so she wrote to her former teacher foi' advice. He subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> for her and encouraged her to read each issue and every article. She did. Shortly a publisher called and arranged for a systematic study of the Bible with her. The seed planted previously while she was in school was developed, and today she is a dedicated, regular minister assisting in sowing the seed of Kingdom truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had two fine “Word of Truth” District Assemblies in Jamaica with a combined attendance of 6,827. The brothers expressed appreciation for the publications received as well as for the information they heard. Favorable comments came from outsiders that attended. One man said that he had never seen a religious group meet in such an atmosphere of peace. He said that other religious organizations had used the same grounds and he had attended their meetings, but never did he see people willingly stand in line in the hot sun waiting their turn to get refreshments without pushing and shoving. He said that he noticed that the Witnesses shut down all operations in their stands and all gave their undivided attention to the things that were discussed from the platform. His comment was, “I didn’t believe there were any people on earth who would behave like this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAYMAN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,511</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 608</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As you approach the Cayman Islands from the air you can see two ships caught on the reef. This tragedy occurred when a warning light failed to operate. This illustrates how man’s warning mechanism can be faulty, possibly causing loss of life or heavy damage or both. The light of truth, however, never goes out. It is a sure guide for those seeking safety from the destruction of the present system of things. This light of truth is shining on the Cayman Islands through the congregation of thirteen publishers. One of these is a seventy-eight-year-old sister who is blind. She consistently reports activity in the ministry by witnessing to the people who come to her home. On one of his visits from Jamaica to this congregation, the circuit servant took with him the film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses” and had a combined attendance of 224 at five showings. Favorable comments were heard from the people as the brothers called on them in the ministry the next day. The reflectors of the light of truth are consistent in their service. Jehovah will not allow their light to go out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Beak Publishers: 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,084</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,042</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people on these islands do not have a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in their midst and no organized witnessing is being carried on. The pioneers who were there last year had to return to Jamaica because one of them needed an operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several persons have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">coming to them regularly, and the Society is encouraging these to congregate and study the main articles together. A newly interested man who recently moved to Grand Turk wrote the Society expressing his appreciation for the magazines. He said: “Please keep the magazines coming, because they are our only source of consolation. It is difficult to understand the Bible without these Bible aids.” His request is being taken care of and the branch office writes him in order to give him encouragement and assistance to further his interest in doing Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 99,483,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,844 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 25,880</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tremendous changes are taking place in Japan as far as heeding the truth of God’s Word is concerned. Jehovah’s witnesses are spreading out to many parts of the country, and it seems that no matter where they go, the Japanese people have an ear to hear. Excellent progress has been made during the past service year in gathering together those who are interested in learning the truth. This year another 571 individuals symbolized their dedication to God’s service by water immersion. So the organization is growing steadily, and all of us rejoice with our Japanese brothers. Here are some experiences as reported by the branch servant in Tokyo regarding Japan, Okinawa Gunto and Sakishima Gunto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Circuit servant visits have been exceptionally well supported, and many congregations have aimed for and reached </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> new publisher peak at each visit. On the Wednesday evening of the visit, the special calls made on irregular and inactive ones have been most fruitful. One inactive sister told the circuit servant and overseer that she thought God’s standards were too high for her. However, tactful Scriptural counsel from Isaiah 55:8, 9 showed her that, while God’s ways are higher than man’s, yet God knows our frame and does not require more than we can do. Much encouraged, the sister restarted her personal Bible study and is now progressing well. That same evening another inactive sister was overjoyed to see the visiting brothers. Using Hebrews 6:11, 12, they encouraged her to study again. She came to the circuit servant’s talk, and is again regularly attending the midweek book study. The overseer clearly saw the need for sustaining this kindly help at all times, not just at the circuit servant’s visit, in line with Jesus’ illustration of leaving the ninety-nine sheep to find the one that was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Brother Knorr was in Japan in December, he put in a strong word for vacation pioneering. For the first four months of the service year we had averaged sixty-one vacation pioneers a month. However, so vigorous was the answer to the call, that the last eight months of the service year saw an average of 140 vacation pioneers each month. Regular pioneers also increased from 103 reporting in September to 154 in August. Further, it has been possible to increase the number of special pioneers right up to our present quota of 300. The pioneer field is alive and progressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One new publisher began to prepare for vacation pioneering even before she was baptized. For a start she took her six-year-old boy and three-year-old girl with her in service for about an hour at a time. Though at first they gave her some trouble, she took them every Wednesday and Saturday, gradually increasing the time from one to three hours. Then she increased her service to four mornings a week, taking the children along for three hours each morning. She taught the boy a simple magazine presentation and the daughter how to greet the householder, so that they could share in the preaching too. She reached her goal by vacation pioneering the month after her baptism, and enrolled again in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Kyoto housewife with two school-age children has found it possible to do effective regular pioneer work through the cooperation of all in the family. First, she tested her strength through vacation pioneering, making sure that she could stand up to pioneer work during the different seasons. When she started to pioneer, she made up a weekly menu, which was posted in the kitchen. If she was to be home late on account of back-calls or studies, the children would consult the menu, do the shopping and get the meal under way. Money for bill collectors was also left in convenient bags for the children to pay, should this be required while she was out. Through careful planning this sister has been able to enjoy two fine years of regular pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young publishers may often succeed where older members of the family have failed to get a response. A nine-year-old publisher was practicing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> short Bible sermon at home. Her father, not a Witness, was listening through the paper walls. He was impressed. Coming into the room, he asked: “What is all this about?” “Well, you be my householder,” the daughter replied, “and I’ll tell you all about it.” She gave the Bible sermon so well that it persuaded her father to subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He soon realized what he had been missing over the years, and he started publishing at a recent assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer started a study with a middle-aged woman who said she was a devout Buddhist. In the room where they studied there was a large, ornate Buddhist altar—the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan.</span><span class="font5"> After studying about “The God of the Bible” in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font5"> booklet, the big doors of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font5"> were shut on the imagery inside, and they remained shut. Three months later, this interested person consented to the room’s being used for the neighborhood book study. Shortly thereafter, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font5"> itself disappeared from the room. The pioneer inquired the reason. The woman said she had tried many ways to find the power behind the universe and its beauty, even to writing Japanese poetry. But her search ended when she learned of Jehovah as the Creator, and so she decided to get rid of her idols, She is now a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OKINAWA GUNTO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;806,846</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 234 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,448</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Word of Truth” District Assembly was held in Koza City in the wake of one of the big typhoons of the year. All the preparations, including those for the cafeteria, were washed out, but an excellent assembly was held. Though Okinawa has only 234 publishers as a peak, there were 311 in attendance at the public talk, and eleven persons were baptized in the storm-tossed sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A zealous sister, who does vacation pioneering at times, was prompted by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> articles on the assistance arrangement to give more attention to her children. Particularly did she apply the suggestions of praising things well done and trying to improve one point at a time. She chose regular weekly service as the first point. Often she had to go and search for the children as they slipped out to play. She had to use the literal rod many times, too, but she did not omit praising them when they shared in the preaching. Now, instead of badgering their mother to take them to the department store so that they can ride on the swings on the roof, the children ask, “Where is tomorrow’s assembly point?” or, “Do you have my magazines?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the highlights of the year in Okinawa was the dedication of the first Kingdom Hall in this territory. It is located conveniently for the meetings of the two units of the Naha Congregation. The brothers show their appreciation of this provision by their fine support of the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SAKISHIMA GTJNTO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127,685</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 10,640</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first baptism ever to take place in these islands was arranged for the circuit servant’s visit in June. One brother and two sisters symbolized their dedication. The new brother had received the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font5">book several years ago from someone on Okinawa. He had studied it on his own, and accepted it as the truth. When a special pioneer called at his home, he showed opposition at first, thinking she came from one of the orthodox missions. He told her that he had accepted God’s kingdom, and that this was already established. When she asked him, “When?” he replied, “In 1914.” Imagine his joy when he learned that his visitor was of the same faith! Though he lives among the sugarcane fields in the country, he is able to associate regularly at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following a visit to Miyako Island, the circuit servant, his wife and the two special pioneers made </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">two-day visit to nearby Irabu Island, with a population of about 10,000. As they preached, they advertised a special public meeting, and sixty persons came. Many magazines and some subscriptions were placed, the circuit servant himself placing 200 magazines in the two days. Not having a place to stay at night, after the public talk they asked if someone could offer accommodations. The mayor of the town promptly invited them to his home for the night. He showed considerable interest and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">Thus the truth continues to spread among the islands of the Sakishima chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,727,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 20,807</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems that the troubles that come to our brothers in Jordan are without end. Those that are external are not too difficult to handle, but when persons within a small organization become disgruntled and turn out to be complainers, these are much more difficult to deal with. When one loses the joy of Jehovah’s service and then causes others to lose it too and starts backbiting and causing gossip, there is far more harm done to Jehovah’s work than a ban might bring upon it. However, in spite of the fact that there are these internal dissensions among some few of those who claim to be brothers, the work continues to move along and the message of the Kingdom is being preached. The branch servant in Jordan gives us some experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past service year has been one of difficulty for the organization from both within and without, but we have not been left in the lurch nor cramped beyond movement. (2 Cor. 4:8, 9) Because of the Boycott Organization’s recommendation, recognition of Jehovah’s witnesses as a religious community was withdrawn on October 27, 1964. This resulted in the closing down of some of our Kingdom Halls and confiscation of Bible literature. Efforts have been made to regain legal recognition, but without success. In December we filed a case in the High Court of Justice, but on March 23, after two hearings, the Court refused our application, stating that it involves “public security” and therefore does not come under the Court’s jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One interested person who had a very weak heart traveled 100 kilometers by car to attend the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assembly. Some tried to discourage her, fearing that the trip might bring on a heart attack. But she would not be discouraged. She attended all sessions and took copious notes. When she heard a speaker point out that the cross is a pagan symbol and part of Babylon the Great, she removed the one from around her neck. Catching the spirit of the assembly, she volunteered for work in the cafeteria. Though on a strict food diet, she did not complain about the food served at the assembly, but ate what everyone else was eating. The assembly talks and association fully convinced her that this was the truth, and she expressed her desire to be baptized at the next assembly. A few months later she opened her home for a congregation book study during the circuit servant’s visit. She mentioned also that she was going to undergo heart surgery and that after the operation she was looking forward to preaching from house to house. Just two days later, before she could fulfill this hope, she passed away peacefully in her sleep and is now awaiting a resurrection in God’s new order, where she will be given full opportunity under the best of circumstances to carry out her dedication and symbolize it by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KENYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,104,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 234 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 38,906</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The country of Kenya is indeed proving to be a fruitful field as the seeds of truth are sown throughout all of that great land. While a number of those who have gained a knowledge of the truth have left the country and have gone to other countries to take up the preaching of the good news, still the increase in Kenya has been marvelous and the report shows a very steady growth in the organization. The branch office in Nairobi looks after the work in Kenya and also gives us reports on Burundi, the Seychelles Islands, Tanzania and Uganda. It is truly a delight to see the work reaching out into these countries where it has been going so slowly for many years. Here are the reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">_ A brother working at the Nairobi Airport conducted Bible studies with three of his fellow employees who soon manifested a deep appreciation of the truth and eagerly took their new-found knowledge home to their families in the Kangundo area, some fifty-five miles out of town. Five family members quickly showed interest and soon began to preach. In order to supply mature help to them a special pioneer was assigned to care for the new group. The following month a circuit visit was arranged, and forty-eight interested persons attended the public talk. Now, just eight months since the first ones began to preach, there is a strong group of twelve publishers at Kangundo, and three of the group have just been baptised at the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Nairobi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been a decided breakthrough in the Indian sections of territory this year for the first time. Ever since the work opened up in Kenya it has been virtually impossible to follow up interest shown in the large Indian community, due to religious ideologies and social traditions. After delivering magazines to an Indian home for more than a year a publisher suggested a study. The family agreed, and that study has produced four publishers from among the children. The two older children, aged sixteen and fourteen, have an intelligent appreciation of the truth and never miss a congregation meeting or Saturday gathering for service. Another Indian man is studying diligently and has obtained all the available literature of the Society. He attends the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study regularly and is making good progress in knowledge. A further study is held with a very interested girl, and sometimes as many as seven attend her study. All this has taken place in territory that had appeared to be completely unyielding. Now hopes have been aroused among the brothers that many from this race will accept the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BURUNDI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,224,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 556,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a happy sequel to last year’s report on Burundi, which concluded with the news that no publishers remained in that territory. One of the missionaries who had previously worked in Burundi kept up correspondence with an interested person, who wrote to say he was studying the Bible with twenty-six interested persons. Plans were made to visit this group, and when the circuit servant arrived he was able to contact, not only a number of the interested ones, but also a publisher who had moved to Burundi several months before from Tanzania and had been fully occupied in preaching since the missionaries had left the country. As a result of this combined activity the service year closed with two reporting, and two more brothers who have already published will now begin to report also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These two new ones have already gained a deep appreciation of the truth. The husband recently withstood a real test of his neutrality. When called along with fellow employees to attend a patriotic ceremony in the main square of the city, he was the only one to refuse to salute the flag when called upon to do so. He was questioned by the military and, when he explained that he respected the flag but could not worship it, his explanation was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SEYCHELLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46,472</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 9,294</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been proved so many times that, when Jehovah’s people zealously serve in an isolated place and refuse to become discouraged, Jehovah blesses such ones with increase. Yet often such increase comes from an unexpected source. Such has been the case in the Seychelles Islands with our two faithful brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having themselves learned the truth in another land and returning to their native land, where the truth had not taken root, this brother and sister would naturally expect that any increase would come as a result of Jehovah’s blessing on their preaching to the people already living on the islands. However, about the time they arrived in the Seychelles another Seychellois family began to study the Bible in Kenya. They made steady progress, and soon husband and wife began to preach. Circumstances caused them to return to the islands in March, and you can imagine the joy experienced by both families upon their arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TANZANIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,309,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 845 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 12,200</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many rural areas where the Word of truth has yet to be heard. Hearing of such a place miles off the beaten track, a special pioneer walked for twentyseven miles over the mountains to a large village. The headman became very interested in the message he heard and called together the villagers with a loud voice, saying, “This man has come to save our lives.” Thirty-five heard the talk prepared by the brother and he placed eighteen books and booklets afterward. Unknown to the brother, the headman sent word to the neighbouring village, and early the next morning he was escorted there to be met by thirty-six persons already assembled to hear the truth. The headman showed unusual hospitality to the pioneer and just ‘made him stay.’ He was eventually allowed to leave on the promise that he would return. Now, just a few months later, the pioneer brother is settled in the original village, which has become part of his new assignment and where there are three who have already begun to preach the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more persons of honest heart are heeding the call to get out of Babylon the Great and are standing firmly on the side of the truth. A Pentecostal leader, after three evenings of lengthy discussion with a brother, became thoroughly convinced that he was learning the truth for the first time. A study was started with him and he soon proved to be one seeking to do Jehovah’s will. When those he used to lead saw that he had changed his religion, they wrote to a pastor of the church asking him to come and help save him from his ‘madness.’ First, the pastor wrote the new brother: “Dear Mr. A---, We have heard that you have changed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">your religion and left our church. . . . Please carefully keep all donations received from our Christian followers. ... I will soon come and collect the money.” On receiving the letter the new brother said to a fellow Witness: “If I hold the money and give it to the pastor, this will indicate I haven’t quit Christendom yet.” So he called together those who had donated the money and returned it to them, having previously kept the record. Two pastors arrived and immediately demanded the money. In reply to the anger they showed after being told what had become of it, the new brother said: “Why didn’t you ask me about the ‘sheep’? But instead you ask for ‘money.’ What is more important, money or people whom I used to lead? Sorry, but I am now serving Jehovah, not money.” Three of those he used to lead are now also learning to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,367,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 42 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 175,405</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many places where it has not been possible for the work to reach yet due to the vastness of the territory and the few brothers. Nevertheless, Jehovah is seeking out his “sheep” from these places. A brother from Kampala was sent on a secular job to Mbale, a town 150 miles away. While there he did a little casual witnessing and left some booklets with a man. Thoughtfully, he gave the person his address in Kampala in case he wanted to contact him for further assistance. He received a letter soon after his return saying that the booklets had taught him some of the truth from the Bible and he wanted to know much more. Then, fortunately, this interested man was transferred to Entebbe, a town just 20 miles from Kampala. The study that was started with him resulted in both the man and his wife’s accepting the truth. They are both now sharing in the preaching work and have made good progress since they were immersed in April. Recently they traveled more than 400 miles to the district assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, and were happy to join in fellowship with 200 of their brothers and sisters there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 28,181,096</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,937 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,747</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 1965 service year brought many blessings to Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea. Besides having a fine increase in publishers the branch office force was able to move into a new branch building, which was constructed on the Society’s property during the year. This is a fine provision for the brothers in Seoul, not only for the Bethel family, but for the two congregations that use the beautiful new Kingdom Hall, which is on the main floor of the building. Here are a few experiences as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Buddhists coming into the truth come under heavy pressure from family and friends. A man in Changho-won had been dissatisfied with his Buddhist religion for a number of years when one of our brothers visited him in his shop with the Kingdom message. Shortly after a regular Bible study began, his second son died and his wife became seriously ill. His family and neighbors pressured him to stop the Bible study on the grounds that his betrayal of the Buddhist faith had brought evil upon his own house and on the village as well. Eventually almost the entire village turned against him. A brother’s timely sermon on not fearing those who can kill the body and the importance of prayer to the living God, Jehovah, for courage to cope with the situation served to encourage him. He stuck it out. His wife, once considered beyond hope, recovered. His neighbors learned to respect him for his faith. He established a permanent magazine route among them. He, his wife and daughter have all been immersed and he has already tasted the privilege of vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all features of Jehovah’s service we are spectacles to men and angels, sometimes not knowing how we are observed by others. A man used to sit in front of his shop playing Korean chess with his friends and thinking how he was wasting his time. He seemed powerless to resist the influence of his cronies and would carouse with them, to the neglect of his wife and children. For two months he had observed a Kingdom publisher going regularly to the house next door to conduct a Bible study. One time the householder was not at home and so this man called to the publisher to come and study the Bible with him instead. A week after that first study he attended the circuit servant’s talk and he was present at meetings every week thereafter. He was impressed with the clean, purposeful lives of the brothers. He suddenly stopped smoking and carousing, and his change in habits was astounding to those who knew him. In six months he was immersed and he has also had the privilege of being a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persistence in calling back often yields happy results. A publisher in Sokcho writes of a woman with three children who was very irregular with her Bible study and who finally would send the children out to say she was not at home. After such an experience a number of times the publisher stopped calling. Sometime later she decided to make one more attempt. This time the lady said: “I have been reading your books. I thought you would never return!” Now that woman is teaching others. Persistence is also illustrated in the case of a brother who called twenty times on a man who said he was too wicked to believe in God and who ridiculed the brother for his clean life. But finally the man consented to a Bible study, cleaned up his life and is now a dedicated Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An elderly pioneer sister had a Bible study with a woman long possessed by the demons. It went away back to the time when she went to spirit mediums for the purpose of assuring the birth of a male child and to cure an illness. Eventually she herself became possessed by the demons. An unwilling tool, she longed to be freed. When her grown daughter became interested in Jehovah’s witnesses she tried to get her mother to take steps to rid herself of the demons. After the daughter was baptized she was successful in getting her mother to agree to a Bible study with the pioneer sister. As the study progressed the woman began to get disturbances such as a rash on her skin, and her skin would feel as though someone poured ice water over it. She became more ill and wanted to stop the studies. The pioneer sister called in her overseer for assistance. He interpreted articles from the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font5"> telling how others had rid themselves of the demons. She agreed to burn up all objects that had ever been used in the contacts with the demons. As soon as this was done she immediately felt better and the rash left her skin. She is keeping up her association with Jehovah’s people and studying to qualify for baptism and has not had a recurrence of her bouts with the demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister in Chonju was told that she would die if she did not accept blood transfusions in the course of a necessary operation. She was scoffed at by doctor, friends and her own husband, who begged her to give in for the sake of their small children. Then came the day of the surgery. She pleaded with her husband to enforce her insistence that no blood be used after she became unconscious. Her husband, who had opposed her so vigorously, was just grimly silent. How thrilled she was when she heard her husband instruct the doctor to obey her wishes and use a blood substitute. Her better-than-usual recovery suprised all concerned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Throughout all the Arab countries of the world Jehovah’s witnesses have difficulty in trying to present the message of the Kingdom. Often they are accused of being Zionists, and it takes considerable time to refute this false charge. People who truly are honest-hearted are quick to see the unreasonableness of these charges, but it takes a much longer discussion to convince them that the Bible is the Word of God and that they should walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. To try to spread the good news of God’s kingdom in Moslem territory is a challenge. It takes real stick-to-itiveness, patience, and, above all, love for God’s kingdom, to keep on preaching. One does not often get a hearing ear, but still very interesting experiences come through from the branch office in Lebanon, which also takes care of the work in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kindness is a quality that always attracts and often helps people come to the truth. Recently, a special pioneer experienced this. While working in his territory, he met a householder who was very much opposed to the truth. When she learned he was a Witness she began to abuse him verbally. She told him that Jehovah’s witnesses were hirelings and lovers of money, interested only in selling books. Actually, she was well known in the neighborhood for having these materialistic qualities herself. She chased the brother away, threatening him with violence if he ever came back. Sometime later the brother, while again working that territory, saw a small boy crying in the street. When the brother asked him what was the matter, he said his mother would not give him any money to buy ice cream like the other children. So the brother felt sorry for him and gave him a few coins. The boy turned out to be the son of the woman who had been so opposed and, when he got home with his ice cream, he told his mother that the “preacher” who had been there sometime before had given him the money to buy it. Now the woman began to feel ashamed of herself because of what she had said to him. Presently she looked him up and apologized for what she had said. She said she certainly had misunderstood Jehovah’s witnesses because of listening to what other people said about them, and she invited the brother to come to her house any time. When the brother called on her the next time, he had a very good Bible discussion with her and she was pleased to receive publications. As a result of more calls she progressed quickly and was soon attending congregation meetings. Whereas she once thought Jehovah's witnesses were paid for their work of preaching and were only interested in money, a small kindness helped her to see the wrongness of her thinking, and she now contributes regularly of her own time and finances to spreading the good news, for she has become a Kingdom publisher herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Opposition can usually be overcome by taking a firm stand. A lady in a small village recently found that to be true. A special pioneer working that territory placed a book with her and, having made an appointment, returned at the agreed time and started a study with her. She and her young daughter were much impressed with the good things they were learning and continued to make fine progress for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> period of time. Word got around that they were studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, and one day in the small village school that the girl attends the teacher took it upon himself to try to stop her from studying the Bible any further. He took her to task before the whole school and threatened to expel her from school if she did not stop studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. She was quite upset and, when she got home, told her mother what had happened. Next day, her mother went with her to speak to the teacher about the matter. He was not at all reasonable, and the lady finally told him firmly that she and her daughter were going to keep right on with their study of the Bible and would very likely be preaching it to others soon and that if he continued to threaten her daughter or expelled her unjustly from school he would be in danger of losing his job. Later the headman of the village and other influential friends of the woman heard about it and called at the school to inform the teacher he had best leave the girl alone, as she was not doing anything wrong. As word of it spread in the small village, people would ask the woman what it was all about, thus giving her an opportunity to speak to them about what she was learning in her study of the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. It brought so many opportunities, in fact, that she and her daughter have decided to become Jehovah’s witnesses permanently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The little band of Witnesses in Iran have continued to press ahead with true worship during the year. They rejoiced greatly that the circuit servant who visited them from Lebanon in the spring was able to show them the latest film, “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World,” and that seventy-eight persons attended the showing. In April </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> number of the brothers enjoyed the privilege of vacation pioneering and were able to sow much seed, as well as water some that had been sown before. Truly the need is great in Iran, and we are glad to see the brothers there doing what they can to fill that need. Would you like to join them?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant stopped off in Baghdad to visit some isolated persons interested in the truth. While there he fell sick because of the hot climate and was obliged to see a doctor. While the doctor was making his examination he asked what the brother’s occupation was and, upon learning that he was a minister, began asking questions on the Bible. An interesting discussion followed and the doctor was much impressed with what the brother had to say. When it came time to pay him, the doctor refused to accept any money, saying that the brother should put it to use in the benevolent work he was doing. So the circuit servant arranged to send him a subscription for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazine and has continued to cultivate his interest through correspondence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Kuwait continue to work under legal ban, since the government has not changed its position toward Jehovah’s people. However, they still keep on spreading the good news. Incidental witnessing is used as much as possible and the brothers are alert to opportunities to speak of the Kingdom. While returning from a meeting one evening, a brother stopped at a shop to make a small purchase. He laid his copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book on the counter while paying for his goods and forgot to pick it up as he left. Later, he remembered where he had left it and returned for it. The shopkeeper had seen the book and looked through it and began to ask the brother some questions about it. As they were speaking, several other customers joined the conversation, and one of them recognized the book as being one of Jehovah’s witnesses’ publications. He began to say that Jehovah’s witnesses do not believe in God and are actually atheists. The brother answered appropriately and the man’s interest was aroused. An appointment was made to call on him at home and a study was soon in progress. A few days later he traveled a long distance to attend the special talk and also came to the Memorial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">For a number of years there have been no publishers reporting from this desert land. There are no native Saudi Arabian publishers, and those brothers from outside the country who had employment with various companies there finished their contracts of work and returned to their home countries. Saudi Arabia is a solidly Moslem country and, though many seeds of truth have been sown there, none have ever taken root in the heart of any Saudi Arabian. We hope that someday they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last few months of the service year two publishers, one from Lebanon and the other from the United States, moved into the country to take up secular work. Since it is not possible to preach openly, they take advantage of all opportunities to witness to workmates and they are gaining experience as to how to approach the people of that land with the message of truth. We are happy that there is once again some witnessing being done there and we pray Jehovah’s blessing upon the further efforts of the brothers during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,067,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There have continued to be legal difficulties and problems in Syria during the year, but the brothers have kept speaking the truth without fear. Four years ago a man was approached with the truth by a friend of his who was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Although he liked what he heard, he did not take an active interest because of unfavorable propaganda against the Witnesses. Later his friend became a baptized Witness and made good progress in his knowledge of the Scriptures. Then during the past year this man’s brother died; so the friend who had now become a Witness took advantage of the opportunity to witness to the bereaved family and friends. What he said about the soul, hell, resurrection and the new order made a deep impression on the man. He felt that his religion was not giving him the needed spiritual nourishment that he saw his friend now had. So later he went to the brother’s shop and asked him to help him get the same knowledge. A study was gladly started with him and his wife. After two months of study the man announced that he had made an important decision. He had been planning to move to Australia with his family and had spent much money making the arrangements, which had been completed. His relatives and his wife’s relatives had tried to change his mind but without success. The truth had accomplished what they had failed to do. He said: “If I go there, who will teach me these things, since I do not know the language? With the knowledge of the truth one can be happy anywhere.” Now he and his wife are both publishers and looking forward to being baptized soon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The branch office on the island of Antigua supervises the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Eusta-tius, Saba, St. Kitts and St. Martin. The brothers on these islands are having experiences similar to those that Jehovah’s witnesses elsewhere in the world have. They hear people say, in effect, “We will go with you people for we have heard that God is with you.” It often takes much time to explain God’s Word to the people; but when they once see the truth and the wonderful purpose of Jehovah God with regard to this earth and man, they show their delight in learning and in associating with Jehovah’s people. On many of these islands there have been fine increases. The first few experiences that follow are from Antigua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the “Word of Truth” District Assembly the brothers in Antigua were privileged to play host to ninety-eight delegates from neighboring islands. This was the first time that so many delegates attended a Christian assembly here, and they were given a special welcome by an enthusiastic group of brothers with cars to transport them to the homes of interested persons where they would be accommodated. At the airport all knew that Jehovah’s witnesses were having a big assembly, so to help the Witnesses clear customs the officials asked the incoming passengers: “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” One passenger emphatically replied, “Me? No, no, no, not me!” “It is all right, madame,” the official replied, “we just wanted to know who were delegates to the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. You will have to go through the regular customs check.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the congregations in the country area has laid the foundation for a new Kingdom Hall. The brothers are finding great pleasure in working together on this project, pooling their labor and resources, because they know it is in the interests of advancing the message of the Kingdom in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGUILLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,810</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Babylon the Great has a tight grip on the inhabitants of Anguilla, but, despite this, there are some very fine Bible studies being conducted with not a few respected and seemingly staunch members of the different religious organizations. A Sunday-school teacher has been attending the meetings at the Kingdom Hall quite regularly. After attending the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study on Sunday she remarked: “I could not allow my minister to prevent me from attending the Kingdom Hall because I have learned enough to understand that the different churches are misrepresenting Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation is making plans to build their own Kingdom Hall, and already a piece of land has been purchased in a central location for this purpose. Four brothers from here were able to attend the “Word of Truth” District Assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The activities in connection with assemblies have touched the hearts of some, as was seen when we were preparing for a circuit assembly in Grand Bay. Persons formerly difficult to witness to opened their homes to delegates, and the few that canceled showed regret when they saw members of their own church accommodating the many arriving delegates. One who canceled the accommodation she had offered because of pressure from her priest later said she was sorry she had done so. When the assembly was over, she told the brother in charge of the accommodations: “I had a share in assisting your brothers after all, for those staying near my home came to my place for a shower in the mornings and I served them coffee and had fruit ready.” It has been much easier to witness in this town since. The Grand Bay Congregation has increased from eight publishers last year to thirteen now, and a peak of sixteen reported in July.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Since the truth was first proclaimed in this island, it has always been stubbornly resisted by Babylon’s false religious systems. But Jehovah’s command, “Get out of her, my people,” is not going unheeded. The truth is more than penetrating the minds and hearts of sincere persons. It is freeing them from Babylon’s clutches, as is noted from the success a special pioneer had by careful preparation for conducting Bible studies. By following the zone servant’s suggestion of finding out the student’s problem and then applying a Scriptural prescription, he helped one person to overcome fear of what others think and say when she applied Bible principles in her life. She was helped to see how important it is to associate with others of precious faith by attending congregation meetings. While she had never traveled before, when announcement was made of a circuit assembly in the neighboring island of Antigua, she did not allow the difficulties of obtaining travel documents and other details to discourage her, but she was in attendance and there, by being baptized, symbolized her dedication to do Jehovah’s will. Afterward she exclaimed: “I am so happy now to be a part of Jehovah’s big family of happy praisers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEVIS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,770</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As a result of the good witness given in Nevis during the year four new ones were brought along to the point of dedication. Because of a water shortage on the island at the time we were having a circuit assembly it posed a problem for householders who were arranging to accommodate delegates from the neighboring island of St. Kitts. However, by working together and with the use of a brother’s truck, the brothers were able to get water from a distant source and supplied water, not only for the assembly, but also to the homes where delegates were staying. By solving this water situation many were able to enjoy the spiritual waters poured out at the assembly in full measure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The regular visits of the circuit servant and his wife are proving a source of encouragement to the one sister here, who is maintaining her brave stand for the Kingdom. This has resulted in giving a fine witness to the people of Oranjestad, the one and only town on the island. During the last visit of the circuit servant the two eldest boys of this isolated sister had some share in the service. During the week fourteen subscriptions were obtained and over sixty magazines were left with the people. This sister was very happy to be able to attend a circuit assembly on the neighboring island of St. Kitts and to enjoy the wonderful association with so many of her brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SABA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,007</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Word of truth is being courageously proclaimed in Saba by an isolated publisher. He and his family have been much encouraged by letters they receive regularly from the missionaries who originally contacted them. When the circuit servant and his wife visited, it was obvious that most people on this little Dutch possession were quite familiar with his preaching activity, because it was not unusual to hear people</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">say, “Oh, that is the religion Mr. B----belongs to. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">often talks to us about those things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Buying out the opportune time” is what the brothers in St. Kitts have been doing during the past year. Learning how to use a good daily schedule was the main subject discussed one evening when a group of sisters in one congregation met to talk about vacation pioneering for the month of April. It turned out that ten of them, including one with seven children, were able to enroll for vacation pioneering in April. The benefits from all this have overflowed, causing more and better congregation activity, for since April many more publishers have been able to join regularly in the congregation’s full weekly schedule. This is one reason this same congregation has increased from thirty-three publishers at the beginning of the year to forty-four now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Time spent attending meetings has more than proved its worth, especially among young publishers. A case in point is that of a young brother at school. One day each student had to give a talk on a selected subject before the class. When the program was through, the headmaster said: “We have had only one real talk this afternoon (referring to the one given by the brother), the rest have no idea how to tackle a subject.” Since then, the young publisher gets more respect from his schoolmaster and schoolmates. This brother never misses meetings and always fulfills his assignments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On this little French and Dutch island the publishers were greatly stimulated by the fine circuit assembly program, especially the part on Saturday night entitled “Fully Embracing Our New Way of Life.” One overseer wrote the Society later stating that, as a result, four inactive ones were revived and two of them have even surpassed the congregation’s goal in hours and Bible studies. The circuit servant remarked how the whole program had made his services to the various congregations more interesting and efficient, for he was now applying the fine suggestions demonstrated, and he has had very good results in reactivating some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Showing appreciation for the truth, a physically disabled brother keeps two donkeys for carrying him to his territory as well as to the meetings. He alternates</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their use so as not to overwork them, as he lives quite a distance from the Kingdom Hall. By this means he is able to benefit from all the congregation activity as well as fulfill his assignment as a servant in the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Things are really happening in Liberia! Two years ago when the great persecution came against God’s people there, there was a tremendous falling away. In fact, the publishers dropped to 241, on the average; but now, with persistent preaching and the conducting of many home Bible studies, as the minds of the people are aroused to understand the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses, many again are listening and are taking their stand for God’s kingdom. This year, instead of 241 preaching the good news of the Kingdom, there were 328, on the average, preaching the good news. Here are some of the experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The issue of maintaining integrity regarding flag saluting has been kept before us again this year as pressure was brought against children refusing to salute the flag in schools. In November three students were expelled for this reason, as authorities denied youthful Witnesses the right of not saluting granted their parents by President Tubman in 1963. When one of these students, a girl of thirteen, told her opposing father what had happened, he beat her and took her back to the school the next morning, promising to force her to salute before the student body. Threats and persuasion in the principal’s office and even another severe beating availed nothing, as the sister held firm her faith in Jehovah. Loyal to her God, she continues her studies at another school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other youngsters suffered the same fate in a small town and were kept out of school for a number of months. Finally, they were allowed to return. They are always a little tardy in the mornings, arriving just after the flag saluting is over, but nothing is said about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Moslem obtained a single copy of a magazine from a pioneer who faithfully kept a record and made the back-call. At first it seemed a fruitless effort, as the man was slow to reason on the Scriptures. More back-calls were made, however, and finally a subscription was obtained and then the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font5"> book was placed. A study commenced. But one day he was very much disturbed, for his wife warned him that, if he followed Jehovah’s witnesses, his people would forsake him. The brother encouraged him by leading the experience from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font5"> of the staunch Moslem in Nigeria who came into the truth with several members of his family. Even Mohammed himself, the brother explained, may come back again and have to acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God and King. This impressed him. Since then the Moslem has become cheerful and studies willingly, glad that the brother did not give up making back-calls on him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Luxembourg were very enthusiastic this year because of the convention they had, the “Word of Truth” District Assembly. This was without doubt the climax of their service year. The brothers were delighted to receive the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font6"> in the German language, and they were very happy that they could start many Bible studies with those persons who accommodated the visitors who came to Luxembourg to attend the assembly. The convention did much for the country and for the brothers, and here is a report from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have an Italian congregation in Luxembourg. This congregation makes good progress and is very active. The publishers do not have a real territory in which to work, but they go to visit addresses where Italian-speaking people live. How do they get these addresses? In various ways. For example, they do street work with magazines and, when a person accepts the magazines, they ask him to leave his address with them so they may visit him. They also go from house to house and examine the names by the bells, and when they find an Italian name they make a visit. Or when they visit an Italian family they ask if there are other Italian families living in the neighborhood. By using every possible way these publishers try to reach the Italian-speaking people in the territory, and they do it with much success. When the German-speaking publishers meet an Italian person they also get the name and address and turn it over to the Italian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experience of a Portuguese sister who moved to Luxembourg helps us to appreciate the meetings more. Pier husband was very opposed to the truth and beat her up every time she attended the meetings in Portugal. But the sister did not get discouraged, and when they moved to Luxembourg the first thing she did was to find out where the Kingdom Hall was situated. In spite of the opposition of her husband, she attended every meeting, although she did not understand one word. She even gave comments in the Portuguese language, and all the brothers appreciated her faith and her zeal. It seems that this conduct even made a good impression on her husband, because he attended the public talk during the last circuit servant’s visit, although he did not understand very much. This is a good way to learn a new language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAGASY REPUBLIC Population: 6,104,014 Peak Publishers: 181 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 33,724</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This past service year saw the largest increase in Kingdom publishers ever realized in the Malagasy Republic. Some of the special pioneers were able to open up new territory, and this aroused much interest. Just to show how eager many of the people are to hear the truth in one of these new territories just opened by missionaries, one of them placed 126 books and obtained 28 subscriptions in the first month. This, of course, gave the missionaries the possibility of starting many Bible studies and, as they settled into a good routine, they had a delightful time declaring the good news. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneer service brings many blessings, as one has more time to spend in the ministry. One pioneer writes: “In 1959 I found a family of twelve members who took a subscription for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine. Later I started a study with them, but because of my secular work I could not conduct the study regularly. In February 1964 I started pioneering and I had more time to take care of this family, and now seven members are publishers and four are already baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the counsel in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> to try to exchange something for the literature or have people pay a little at a time, one publisher reported this experience: “In making door-to-door visits I met a lady who seemed to listen very intently, but after the sermon she said she had no money. I suggested trading something, but she said she had nothing to trade. But after I told her she could pay a little at a time, she quickly agreed. In calling back I immediately started a study, and as our ‘Fruitage of the Spirit’ District Assembly was the following week, I invited her. To my surprise, she was there with some of her children. She made good progress in her study and attended all five meetings regularly. Just five months after the first study she became a publisher, and in her first month she placed 79 magazines, while a few months later she placed over 200. Also, she immediately started a study with her mother and several others in the family, and now her mother is attending meetings also. She had intentions of being baptized at our recent circuit assembly; however, for financial reasons she could not attend. She now plans to be baptized at our coming district assembly, which will be held in her hometown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAWI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15,036 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 233</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The problems in Malawi have all been big ones during the past few years. The persecution and opposition from different quarters that have befallen Jehovah’s witnesses have required real faithfulness on the part of God’s people. By not neglecting the house of their God, even though in many instances it was just under the open skies, they were able to keep up their courage and faith and were able to carry on with the ministry. The very difficult days of a year ago are gone, and now real satisfaction is the lot of the faithful ones because of walking in integrity. Here is a very interesting report from the branch servant in Malawi covering that country and also Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big wave of persecution that had struck the brothers during the last service year gradually lessened. Only sixteen Kingdom Halls and a few homes were destroyed this year. Instead of keeping quiet, Jehovah’s witnesses have continued to preach about God’s kingdom. In fact, every effort was made to give a thorough witness in rural and unassigned territory as well as giving personal assistance to those who had become inactive. Gradually the work built up so that by the end of the service year, with over fifteen thousand publishers reporting field service, we had reached the same number of publishers that we had before the persecution started. So the year ended with the brothers very much strengthened and zealously engaging in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never should we underestimate the value of letter writing. Often through letters people come to a knowledge of the truth. A brother received </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> letter from a boy who asked the brother to meet him and teach him the Bible. The brother replied, giving a witness, and said he would be very happy to do that. It was then that the violent wave of persecution broke out against the brothers. Homes were destroyed and the brothers scattered. Four months later, when the brother returned to his village, he received another letter from this boy. When replying, the brother also sent a tract, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</span><span class="font5"> They were unable to arrange to meet, as the brother was being assigned a long way away as a special pioneer. But their correspondence continued. Through the tract and letters the boy’s interest became strong. He wanted to know how he could become a Witness. He was put in touch with the local congregation. Now he attends meetings regularly and is sharing in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year many new Kingdom Halls were built to replace those that had been destroyed. Many of these new Kingdom Halls are larger and better built than the previous ones. At one congregation the brothers contributed so that they could have a galvanized-iron-sheet roof instead of the grass one that had been on their previous Kingdom Hall. After the hall had been built, there were many favorable comments from passersby. Some said: “You people, Jehovah’s witnesses, are really surprising in your ways. Your hall was destroyed, and now, look, you have built something better and with an iron roof.” In reply the brothers said: “In fact, whoever destroyed our hall seems to have helped us, for we wouldn’t have built this new one so soon. Now we have a far better hall than before.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How much do we appreciate the circuit servant’s visit? Do we have our activities well scheduled? When</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the circuit servant visited one isolated group, an interested woman had arranged her personal schedule so that she could spend more time with theocratic things. For three days she got up at 5 a.m. so as to do her housework and prepare food for the midday meal. This gave her at least two hours each day to spend studying with the circuit servant’s wife. The result of her arranging a good schedule and building up appreciation for the truth was that, by the following circuit servant’s visit, she was conducting her own Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What would you do if you moved to another town and were the only publisher? Being publishers of the good news means that we would continue preaching. One sister who was baptized at the Milan assembly in 1963 came to Mozambique. Through certain circumstances five months passed before she was contacted by the brothers. What had she been doing in the meantime? Even though her husband was not interested in the truth, she had not let anything stop her from witnessing at every occasion. As a result, not only was she conducting a study with her young son, but she also had a study with a group of interested persons and a study by mail. One way she had found helpful for incidental witnessing was to use newspaper clippings. She would cut out items of news that illustrate the fulfillment of Bible prophecies. Onto these clippings she would write down various texts of prophecy. In this way she would have readily at hand scriptures and points of interest for talking the truth with her neighbors and for the Bible study she was conducting by mail. The circuit servant and his wife were the first to contact her in Mozambique. Tears of joy were in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It was just two years ago that Singapore and two Borneo states were celebrating their entry into the newly formed federation of Malaysia. At the close of the past service year Singapore became an independent nation. The rulers of the states were not able to solve by arbitration the problems that arose. Now the island city of Singapore is an independent state again. However, Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the entire territory are just as united now as they were last August. They all came together in the “Word of Truth” Assembly and were able to rejoice over the fine increase they had during the year. Here are some experiences from the branch servant of Malaysia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘’Why did I stay away so long?” exclaimed a brother who had studied with Jehovah’s witnesses sixteen years ago. He had begun to associate with the congregation and even to share in the field service. Then alter some months this young man disappeared and materialism took the place ol the truth. Over the years some effort was made to get him to return, but with no success. In fact, he resented it. He was too busy. Money was coming in, he had lots of friends and he even looked into some of the other religions. But things changed. He married, children came along and so did responsibility. “Then,” he says, “it was a visit to the home of a relative that brought home to me the truth in all its awe-inspiring beauty and wonder. This relative was having a Bible study, and the brother who was conducting it was one of the brothers whom I had met sixteen years ago and whom I had once condemned for attempting to get me to return to the fold. I was reluctant to speak on this occasion but listened to the study. My mind went back to the time when I studied, and really, I had not known true contentment or inward joy since then. I was impressed with the kindness and patience of the brother and his desire to help; after all, he could have reprimanded me. Now, I wanted to come back. Three weeks later I returned to the study again, took part and was invited to the Kingdom Hall.” From here on, the drama of the prodigal son with all its warm, human appeal was reenacted. The brothers welcomed him, though many had never seen him. And what was it that particularly struck him? He says: “The cordial atmosphere and the love and kindness of the brothers took away all my feelings of remorse.” But what made this occasion even happier was that he brought with him his wife, their seven children, his brother and wife with their children and another of his relatives, and he says there are more relatives to come. Four of them so far have symbolized their dedication by water immersion. There is no need to stay away so long!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There are three small islands in the Indian Ocean, and on the island of Mauritius the Society has established a branch office that directs the work in these islands. Excellent progress has been made during the year, and in all three islands they have enjoyed an increase averaging 26 percent. This has brought great pleasure to Jehovah’s witnesses because of the opening of the eyes of many to take hold of the truth. The branch servant gives us experiences on the work done in Mauritius, La Reunion and Rodrigues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Tamil family worshiped a god and two goddesses. For two of them they built grottoes where they offered sacrifices. The third god was neglected. When a certain window was left open, the covers of the man’s bed would be partially pulled from him and something would shake him by the shoulder as soon as the lights were put out for the night. He made an offering of sardines and burned incense and candles to the third god and the trouble stopped. When the family started to study the Bible, they stopped their worship of all these false gods. The grottoes became covered with plants and rubbish. One day the man told the minister who was studying with him that he was again troubled by this hand at night. Bible counsel was given and the advice to destroy all the old religious relics from around the home. After spending the whole of one afternoon breaking down the cement grottoes and throwing out the religious pictures, he has not been troubled since and is now preaching the Kingdom good news and freedom from fear to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher met a woman who took the magazines, saying that her husband was interested. Calling back when the husband was home, he was able to start a Bible study. As the study progressed, the woman manifested much interest; she would not take part in the study but only listened. The reason was that she could not read. By his emphasizing the important points and helping her to memorize them, she was able to answer and take part in the study. Soon she saw the need to preach, but, as they were not married although having lived together for seventeen years, the first thing they did was to get married. For service she had someone write out the Bible verses of the sermon, which she learned by heart. Now she knows most of the Bible books and keeps up with the new sermons. She makes back-calls and conducts Bible studies with the help of sisters who can read. She got baptized at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the last assembly and is now serving as a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LA REUNION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;395,737</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With the quick growth in Reunion the main town now has a congregation of 109 publishers. This means that the territory is worked every three weeks or so. When the magazine was presented to one woman, the reply was, “No! I am not interested,” and she firmly closed the door. Three weeks later this same publisher was again before this same door. Should she knock or should she not? She did! The woman, amazed, asked her, “Why have you returned so quickly after the way I treated you last time?” The answer led into a sermon, and a study was arranged. The lady is now baptized and very pleased to be part of Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It often takes a long time for persons to change their lives to conform to Bible principles. The following is a good example of this. For two years a lady had been studying. She could not read but had a very good memory. She began to have a good knowledge of the Bible. Yet to some extent she still practiced her religion, which originated in India and is widely followed throughout the island. She told fortunes by means of cards and was living in concubinage. Seeing that no real effort was being put forward to practice Bible principles, the pioneer thought to stop the study. Because of a change in pioneer assignments another sister took over the study. She writes: “After a few months her appreciation began to increase and, to my great joy, she stopped all her devilish practices. One obstacle remained: To legalize her marriage. This would be much more difficult. The man did not want to marry, and she did not want to leave him. Seeing that no progress was being made, I decided to stop the study. Some time later I met her in the street and she asked me to visit her again. Finding it difficult to refuse, I called, but only agreed to conduct the study on condition that she straighten out her situation as quickly as possible one way or another. I counseled her to pray to Jehovah about it, which she did. From this she found the courage needed to pose conditions to her consensual marriage partner. To her great joy he agreed to marry her legally, and they have taken the necessary steps to do so. The man, too, is showing interest in the truth and attends meetings with her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RODRIGUES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19,350</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This small island 350 miles east of Mauritius is just coming out of the “dark ages.” Even now to have work or an education one needs to be in the favor of the Catholic priestly ruling class. Of the 19,000 inhabitants, the latest census showed that over 12,000 are illiterate. During the past service year the light of truth has penetrated into this darkened corner of the earth. It has met with vigorous opposition by the priests and bumptious officials who do their bidding. When a special pioneer made an application, in November 1964, for a residence permit, he was told that he would have to await a reply from Mauritius. Six months later he was summoned to court and charged with failing to leave Rodrigues within six months. He was convicted, taken by the police to the boat and deported. When the matter was taken up in Mauritius, no record of his application was found in his file at the immigration headquarters. Why was he not wanted in Rodrigues? The only reason that was ever given was that he was distributing pamphlets! The matter was taken to the Law Society, a body that advises the Mauritian government on difficult matters, and the brother quickly received his permit to return. He has now returned to rejoin his Rodrigian wife, and together they are busy spreading the “everlasting good news.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s servants in the land of Mexico have had another blessed year of faithful Kingdom service that has been fruitful. Their efforts have been rewarded as they have endeavored to preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom throughout the land. There are many more publishers now to press forward into isolated areas and in the territories of the congregations, and all of us rejoice with our brothers in this land that they are able to help the interested people gain maturity in the truth. Here are some experiences as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That placements should be followed up and the person helped to appreciate the truth can be seen in the case of a man who subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and renewed it himself for three years. None of the brothers made a back-call on him during all this time. An Adventist preacher found him reading the magazine and commended him for reading a Bible magazine. He invited him to his church and for the following year he attended but did not stop reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">With the knowledge acquired by reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> he progressed rapidly and obtained various positions in the church, such as treasurer, Sunday-school teacher and others. Everything came to an end when the Memorial date arrived. He was assigned to a group where he would serve the emblems. But when they saw that he did not participate they asked him why. He defended himself Biblically according to his knowledge from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and when they discovered that he had doctrinal points like the Witnesses they told him to stop reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and when he refused to do so they excommunicated him. He kept on reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and when the Witnesses found him again he lost no time in asking for the address of the hall. Now he and his three children are publishers and the whole family is studying and progressing outside of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” has done its part to help sincere people. As one man expressed it: “In this film I noticed how persons worship horribly carved gods and that these steal worship from Jehovah. Now that I am studying with Jehovah’s witnesses I have learned a lot from the Bible and I realize that it is an insult to Jehovah to worship these gods. I tell my wife not to go to the Catholic church, because there they also worship images, and that is not correct in Jehovah’s eyes. I thank you very much for exhibiting this film; it is really an eye-opener for humanity.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Due to difficult times many people find it necessary to leave Morocco and go to Europe in order to find employment. This exodus of people has affected the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of the brothers who went to Europe to attend assemblies this past summer did not return to Morocco. They, too, have found it much easier to get employment in Europe, since, for the most part, they are Europeans. Even though this occurs, there are always many people who remain, and the publishers who remain still have a lot of interest to take care of. Herewith are some experiences sent in by the branch servant for Morocco and Gibraltar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Sunday morning a sister enjoyed a very interesting discussion with a young French Catholic woman who knew the church doctrines quite well. It was evident from the discussion that she was not at all satisfied with the Catholic church. The sister asked the woman if she could call back some evening with her husband so that they could speak with her husband as well. “Oh, no!” declared the young woman, saying that her husband, who is a professor, did not believe and was a complete atheist and possibly would not even care to receive them. One evening the brother and sister made arrangements to call on this young couple anyway. The professor received them well and, without having to be invited to sit in on the discussion, did so of his own desire. He said to the brother and sister, “Offer me good reasonable proofs that God exists and that the Bible is truly inspired and authentic and I will accept it.” This was done with the aid of the Society’s publications. Today this young couple is convinced that Jehovah exists and that he has upon the earth a people for his name. Four months from the time that this study was started they became publishers of the good news and are awaiting the the day in the near future to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah by baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people get in touch with the truth in strange ways. Notice how it was done in the following experience. As a special pioneer was leaving his home to make some calls he found a man looking for Jehovah’s witnesses. He had received the address from a sister in Marrakech but had lost it. He therefore went to all the different Protestant churches in the city asking if they knew the whereabouts of Jehovah’s witnesses. At each church they would speak against the Witnesses. But finally an Adventist gave him the address of one who was studying, who, in turn, gave him the address of the special pioneer in the city. The man first presented himself to the pioneer as one who was just curious. But really the man had many intelligent questions, resulting in a four-hour discussion on different Bible themes. The man explained that he works out in the country and comes to town from time to time to buy supplies and vegetables. One time at the market the man received his vegetables wrapped in a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He read the magazine and immediately started looking for Jehovah’s witnesses. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> he had read explained how the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book had helped many people to learn the truth. He therefore wanted one of these books for himself. Before he left the pioneer, he obtained three books, five booklets and ten magazines. He also gave the pioneer his address, so that a study by mail could be had with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GIBRALTAR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25,721</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“As solid as the Rock of Gibraltar!” This is an expression used by many people. The small congregation here is working hard to make this expression apply to them in a spiritual sense. Although the preaching work got its start in an organized way only six years ago, the brothers have managed to form a solid congregation that enjoyed a 42-percent increase during this past service year. This forward thrust was not made without overcoming some problems peculiar to this military base. When the issue of being neutral in one’s secular employment was clearly presented to the congregation, it meant a loss of about 35 percent of the publishers, including two servants. Yet the congregation was anxious to abide by the Bible principle on neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of much prejudice against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Gibraltar, a wonderful location was hired for an assembly. A very enthusiastic assembly was held and eighty-five persons showed keen interest in the Society’s film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World.” Due to the good impression that this assembly made on the interested persons that attended, many are now regularly attending the congregational meetings and some are now publishers of the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many people of this world do not yet know the happiness that comes with being one of Jehovah’s witnesses and therefore there is always a stimulus present to be a faithful minister of God and find those who long for that happiness. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Netherlands have many things for which to be happy. One is the dedication of the new Bethel home, which took place in March of this past year. Outstanding, too, during the year was the tremendous public meeting attendance at the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Rotterdam. There were 21,816 at that public meeting, and now our brothers in the Netherlands are looking forward to meeting many of these persons and others in their ministry. They are also looking forward to the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font6"> in Dutch. This, too, should stimulate the work. Here are some experiences that were sent to the Society through the branch office in Amsterdam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While working from house to house on Magazine Day, a publisher contacted a lady who said she had no time because she had to take care of her baby. She asked, “Will you please come back another time?” When the publisher called again there was nobody at home. He called again, this time contacted the husband, gave a sermon and made an appointment to call again the next evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon returning to make the back-call the publisher was invited to come in, but strangely the householder kept his right hand inside his jacket. What was wrong? This couple had tried to investigate the publisher by asking other people about him. The conclusion was that they thought he was a Russian spy. As a precautionary measure, the man, who was a goldsmith by profession, put a tear-gas gun in his inside jacket pocket and if the brother made one false move, he would shoot! Unaware of this dangerous situation, our brother started a Bible study. Opposition came soon in the form of the fatherin-law, who was opposed and tried to disrupt and stop the study. After spending an evening talking to the father-in-law about the Bible with little success, the brother still tried to be friendly by inviting the fatherin-law to work with him at his secular work, as he needed some extra help. The father-in-law accepted the offer on the condition that they would not talk about the Bible. Nevertheless, at lunch the conversation always switched to the truth. After some weeks the father-in-law had to admit that Jehovah’s witnesses were a different people. He now wanted to study the Bible himself but was sure his wife would oppose. Unknown to him, however, his wife and another son already had started studying the Bible. The saying is, “All’s well that ends well,” and now the first couple has been baptized and the man is now carrying the sword of the spirit instead of a tear-gas gun, while the study with the wife’s parents is progressing very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And how about the congregation overseer who had one person in his territory who became inactive twenty-five years ago? He had kept this person in his memory, and for the last ten years he has regularly brought him the magazines. Slowly his interest increased. Now he does not miss one meeting and, since he became active again two years ago, he takes his ministry very seriously. Next year he will retire from his secular work but not from Jehovah’s work. He is planning then to start his career in the full-time service of Jehovah. This is a wonderful demonstration of endurance that brings blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NETHERLANDS ANTILLES (Curacao)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 222 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134,250</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 605</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s branch office on this island directs the work on the three islands of the Netherlands Antilles, namely, Curacao, Bonaire and Aruba. Many tourists travel to these islands of the Caribbean and so the Kingdom publishers are able to meet travelers from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the Americas. Even though the territory is worked often, newly interested ones are still being found and are being helped in a study of the Bible. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant covering all three islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands of tourists visit Curacao yearly and often they take magazines or come and take pictures of our new branch home here. One day a group of publishers saw what they thought was a sister from the U.S.A, doing street magazine work on the main street downtown. They rushed up to greet her, only to learn that she was not a sister at all but a tourist from California who wanted to see how it felt to do magazine street work as she had seen it done back in the States. She had taken magazines from a pioneer sister in the park here. There is always some unusual experience in the missionary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In harmony with a recent suggestion of the Society we have been giving more attention to our more elite territory that is sometimes bypassed. Many people living in the upper echelon are more concerned about world conditions and what the future holds than the less fortunate people. A brother working in the elite section of Curacao reports the following experience. The householder began scoffing and ridiculing the message. He said he preferred Buddha, Confucius, or Dr. Albert Schweitzer rather than the Bible. With that he chased the publisher out of the house in a rude manner. Outside the front door </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> friend of the householder (also an architect) met the publisher coming out and said: “You seem to have had a hard time with my friend.” The publisher said: “It could have been worse; Jesus was killed for preaching the truth, but I am still able to go to another house to look for people in a better frame of mind.” Amazed, the man said: “Where do you get the courage to continue in this work?” The publisher said: “From the Bible.” Then the man said: “Impossible; the Bible is full of contradictions, teaching things impossible to believe, such as the trinity doctrine.” This statement was the beginning of a very lively discussion. The homeowner now came outside and said: “Why don’t you folks come inside out of the hot sun?” He now asked the publisher some sincere questions, such as, “How could God have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> son?” The publisher had read the article in the September 15, 1965, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on the same subject just the night before, so he said to the man: “The One planting the ear, can he not hear? Or the One forming the eye, can he not look?” (Ps. 94:8, 9) The One who gave man the power to have sons, can He not have a son? This completely disarmed the homeowner. He apologized for the way he had acted at first and took two new subscriptions and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font5"> book. We really should not hold back from working the more difficult territories, because Jehovah will bless our efforts when we have courage and exercise faith in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59,642</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 152 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 392</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last service year the work in Aruba has gone quite well, especially among the natives. One thing that has helped toward this progress was the release of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book in Papiamento at our “Fruitage of the Spirit” District Assembly early in October last year. Even fanatic Catholics admit that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book is the most beautiful book ever published in the Papiamento language. When these same people begin reading and studying in this book, they are even more amazed at the clear and yet simple manner in which the truth concerning God’s purpose for the earth and man on it is set out. This has helped many former Catholics to flee from Babylon the Great. The priests in Aruba are quite disturbed about the flight of so many of their prisoners. For many years the priests have belittled and ridiculed Jehovah’s witnesses, but now things are changing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BONAIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,638</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 302</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation servant wrote that when one </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was placed in Papiamento it was like placing two books because, when another person would find his friend with one of these books, he would come looking for one like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have one special pioneer in Bonaire and he has been working very hard and has made some progress in spite of the tough territory he has. He keeps a close record of each person that takes literature or shows interest and calls back. In that way he has been able to start many new studies and now has his home Bible studies up to the special pioneer goal of ten every month. If this brother places a magazine and does not get the name of the person taking it, he still puts down something by which he can identify the person. For example, the man in the post office who takes the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> regularly he has listed on his magazine route sheet as “Mr. Money Order.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWFOUNDLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland are very much concerned with caring for their responsibilities in the ministry. They realize people must hear in order to gain salvation. If they are going to hear, there must be ministers. That gives the servants of God on earth an opportunity to demonstrate their love to Jehovah and to prove their integrity. They are preaching the good news of the Kingdom and at the same time a warning is given to all, whether they hear or refuse to hear, that the end of this wicked system of things is near at hand. By doing this work of Kingdom witnessing the name of Jehovah is publicized throughout all the land. These are things worth accomplishing in the ministry. To do this work thoroughly the territory must be covered, not just by knocking on the door of the first floor of homes, but by being sure that every family living in a building is contacted. One never knows whom he might find if he inquires at each home as to whether other families are living in the building. Here are some interesting experiences from Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The house-to-house ministry is not the only means to aid interested ones on the way to salvation. Writing letters can also do much good. After carrying on a correspondence Bible study course with an interested lady for several months, it was so encouraging to hear that she was sharing with her neighbors what she was learning. A sister enjoyed receiving the following letter: “We were held so long under false teaching that it takes quite </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a lot of</span><span class="font5"> courage to keep going in the right direction now that I have found that way. No matter how hard the pressures may come, I am determined to reach the goal of salvation we are fighting so hard to get. I find the majority of the people very difficult to speak to, but I am going to make another try with my neighbors and friends and see if I can get at least a few of them to see things God’s way. There must be some hope in some of them, but I guess they have been blinded so long it will probably take some time before they realize it. However, I do know of a settlement where I believe I would find some persons interested in Jehovah and his Word and as soon as I am feeling better I will try to call on all of them. It will mean a five-mile walk, but it will be more than worth it to find people who want to listen to the truth and be taught the way of salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fulfilling the purpose of the ministry certainly encourages all of Jehovah’s servants to devote as much time as possible to the work of Kingdom preaching. Much stress was placed on the privileges of the vacation pioneer ministry during the 1965 service year. We were pleased that 15 percent of the average publishers shared in this service during 1965. The majority of those who accepted this privilege had problems to overcome. A sister explains her particular problem in the following way: “I thought for quite a while, since I had a home and children to care for, that the vacation pioneer service was not for me. But with so much encouragement coming from Jehovah and his organization and after prayerful consideration I decided it was time for me to arrange my affairs so that I could be a vacation pioneer. First, I had to readjust my schedule to care for the three children and home responsibilities as well as decide how to meet the pioneer goals. While I was making plans my husband decided that he too would be a vacation pioneer. This was all the encouragement I needed. Our month in the vacation pioneer service was a very happy one for both of us. It greatly aided the children too because they not only assisted in the work around the house but we were able to help all of them surpass the wholesome goal of ten hours. We enjoyed it so much that we now want to be vacation pioneers at least once each year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW ZEALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,640,117</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,854 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 544</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s name and kingdom are kept to the fore in New Zealand year by year. There is much rejoicing over the release of the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font6"> The branch servant reports that within half an hour of their arrival at the branch in New Zealand the first week in August the congregation supplies were on their way to the railroad stations and the shipping lines. The brothers were eager to get this book into the hands of the people immediately in order to start more Bible studies, if that is possible. Here are some experiences on the part of the brothers as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One sister wrote enthusiastically to tell how, as soon as she read the book, she decided that here was something she could understand and conduct a study with. She decided to call on each one on her back-call list and also on each person on her magazine route to offer the new book. Carefully she preselected chapters that would be of particular interest. For one of her calls it was the chapter on “Freeing the Dead People from Hades.” Another was perplexed about the “Sabbath,” so chapter 14 was highlighted. The result? August ended with eleven of these calls made, eleven books placed, a new study started and four more calls still to be made. Good preparation linked with a positive attitude brought a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes a long-standing friendship opens the way to give a witness where others have failed. A sister found this to be true with an elderly lady she had known for twenty years. Other Witnesses had tried unsuccessfully to discuss the Bible with her. Simply for friendship’s sake she agreed to a study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book. The lady had visited many churches searching for the truth and could not believe that Jehovah’s witnesses would be able to help her. Despite interference from a clergyman who managed to have the study temporarily stopped, the study was resumed and now this seventy-six-year-old person is a baptized sister, regular in service and meeting attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer sister tells of a great joy she had as a result of incidental witnessing while traveling to her territory on a bus. She struck up a conversation with a young woman who proved to be very interested in the Bible. Before parting the young woman’s address was obtained and a time arranged for a visit by the pioneer. A Bible study was started on the first call and continues to progress. What made the experience especially gratifying was the fact that the young woman’s address turned out to be one that had been consistently “not home” over a long period and none of the publishers had been able to meet her before. Assuredly, the incidental witness given during the bus ride was timely!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.” The truth of this was well demonstrated in the case of a sister who conducts a Bible study with a neighbour’s ten-year-old daughter. Although not objecting to the study, the mother requires that her child attend the Bible lessons conducted each week at school by a clergyman. One day the minister gave the class a written test. The children were to write out the Apostles’ Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. This child wrote that she could not write the Apostles’ Creed because the apostles had not written it and because it was not in the Bible. She wrote the Ten Commandments out fully and the Lord’s Prayer with the exception of the spurious part, “Thine is the kingdom . . .” Questioned about her answer on the Lord’s Prayer, she quoted the April 15, 1964, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which said that if the kingdom was already God’s, there would be no point in also praying “Thy kingdom come.” On her own initiative she has elected not to participate in the singing of the national anthem at school. At home she always silently gave thanks for her meal, until one day a woman boarder asked, “Why don’t you say it for your mother and me also?” So that is now done. On the occasion of the last visit of the circuit servant the mother attended the public talk and made the comment that she was becoming aware of the need to make time in her life for spiritual matters. Indications are that the daughter may well be the means of aiding her mother to find the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,664,676</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 692 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,406</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Nicaragua have made good progress in presenting the message of the Kingdom effectively to the people. As the ‘desire of all nations’ continues to stream into the organization, the servants in the local congregations have felt the vital need for better organization and they are giving a lead in this to the publishers in the congregations. They are seeing to it that the ‘desirable ones’ are helped to gain maturity and remain in Jehovah’s place of safety and protection. The branch servant reports that in the block where the Society’s branch office and Kingdom Hall are now located there are no less than nine Bible studies being conducted with the neighbors. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have you ever found a handbill in a bag of beans or rice? One sister has a small store where she witnesses to everyone who comes to buy. She also places a handbill in every little package that she wraps. As a result of this, one customer returned and asked for a book. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was placed. When a ten-year-old boy listened to a simplified sermon, his interest did not go unobserved and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Bible study was started. In two months he was participating in the service, and now his mother, noting his unusual interest, likewise studies. This sister’s love removes all fear of what the customers might say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should not feel defeated when someone says, “I cannot read or write.” One publisher while offering the magazines encountered this objection but had prepared for it in advance, knowing she would be working in such territory. She explained that she would be very happy to return and read the magazines to the lady. This was done. Then the lady w<sup>T</sup>as taught to read, and in only ten months she was able to read for herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The high moral standard imposed by the Bible is repeatedly ignored by loveless Christendom. No wonder they are not able to change the wanton lives of their members. When one prominent member of a certain community began regular Bible discussions with a publisher, the local Catholic priest wrote him a letter stating that he was wasting his time. Why? Because he just had too many vices to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He had better remain a Catholic! But the love of this sincere man for the truth is not failing, and he has made unprecedented progress in shedding the vices, acceptable to the “church,” ever since </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> weekly Bible study was established. A Bible discussion just once or twice a month was not enough to produce the desired change.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The blessing of Jehovah is what makes rich, and this blessing was especially noted in Nigeria during the past year. There were excellent increases in all features of the Kingdom service during the past year. Nigeria itself had a 7-percent increase in publishers, Dahomey 9 percent, Fernando Poo 14 percent, and there are a few new reports coming from territories cared for by the Nigerian branch, namely, Niger and Rio Muni. All of Jehovah’s witnesses in these African territories are striving to help all the people they can to get a knowledge of Jehovah’s kingdom. Here are some experiences from these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many are the favorable results of viewing the Society’s films. A politician who was hostile to the truth witnessed the film show by chance and enjoyed himself. After the show he decided to reconsider his stand and asked the brother to visit him to study with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On another occasion the film helped overcome one of our most frequently encountered objections, that the literature should be free. After seeing how the magazines are printed and the enthusiasm of the Bethel workers, a man said: “Formerly I decided not to put a penny on your magazines, but now I have seen what the work of their printing is worth. Therefore I will never demand them free anymore.” He then contributed for his first magazine and promised to obtain them regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister’s experience shows that tactful perseverance brings results at last. “I called at a home and found a lady who was not interested; but the husband, a pastor, accepted a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> A Bible study was started. The pastor wanted his wife to be as conversant with the Scriptures as Jehovah’s witnesses are, so he urged her to join the study. Gradually the children also joined in. The wife started to show interest and seemed satisfied with the answers to her many questions. I invited her to a public lecture. She got ready, but the pastor became angry. ‘I only want you to understand the Bible,’ he said, ‘not to become a Witness.’ I tactfully told him that by just attending a lecture she could not be made a Witness, so he allowed her to go. The woman was thrilled by what she heard, and wanted to come every Sunday. It was arranged that I should not call at the house, but we met along the road, unknown to the husband. Soon afterward she began to question the doctrines and practices of their religion, such as the ringing of church bells and feasting after church services. Not being able to answer from the Bible, the husband angrily said: ‘I did not ask you to join Jehovah’s witnesses, but just to learn the Bible. Therefore you must not go there again as of today.’ The wife retorted, ‘Well, I will cease to go when you relinquish your post as a pastor.’ When she persisted, he drove her away, but she continued steadfast. He then falsely accused the Witnesses of seducing his wife. Meanwhile his flock scattered and the pastor found himself jobless. The wife continued her study, dedicated herself, got baptized at the circuit assembly and is now a three-month vacation pioneer, hoping to qualify as a regular pioneer soon. The husband? He is reconciled with his wife and has resumed studying the Bible with the brothers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DAHOMEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Blessings come to those who move to serve where the need is great even if it is in one’s own circuit. At the suggestion of the circuit servant two pioneer brothers and their wives and a single pioneer brother moved to isolated places in the circuit. One of these places had not been witnessed to in ten years. Now, two years later, here are the results: A congregation has grown out of one isolated group, and two new isolated groups have been formed in strongly Catholic towns where ten years ago the brothers were arrested and imprisoned. Can you respond to the invitation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year fifty-four publishers were aided to learn to read and write. This is three times as many as the year before. A brother writes: “Since one’s progress in the truth depends upon his being able to read God’s Word, I take time in teaching the one I am conducting a study with to read the Bible. This enlivens his interest, and within five weeks he is able to read the Gun Bible. One person so aided is now happy that he can read God’s Word. He can now prepare his lesson and give good comments. So it is possible to overcome illiteracy.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Though since independence there is a bit more freedom than under former harsh colonial rule, it is still dangerous to preach openly in this territory. A vacation pioneer was having a Bible study with an interested person when a police officer walked in and had him stop the study. He then began to examine the books and Bibles and inquired what those books were. Learning that it was Bible literature, he asked the publisher to go with him to the police office with the publications. On their way another publisher was arrested when he asked why the brother was arrested. A man who had only attended a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses called the police office to inquire of the welfare of these Witnesses and was also arrested. The third man was released late in the night when the police satisfied themselves that he had only attended one meeting of the Witnesses, while belonging to the Catholic religion. The police searched the book bag of the first accused but found he had left the books somewhere while the one arresting him was engaged in conversation with a girl friend, so they beat him. Not knowing what the books were that the second accused had in his bag, they sent for the Catholic priest, who, after examining the books, told the police he did not know what they were. Yes, the priest did not know even the two copies of the Bible taken out of the publisher’s bag! Another prominent person in town was sent for who told the police the books were good religious books—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> The Holy Bible in Efik and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things.”</span><span class="font5"> The two publishers were now beaten the more for teaching the people from the Bible, the books were taken and burned and they were both released the following day. The searching of book bags happens quite often with questioning from the police, who seem to think that they are doing commendable work for the Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the circumstances in the territory the Society’s representative who served one of the congregations on the island used the seaside for the meeting with the servants. This provided more privacy than any room. In order to fulfill the command to commemorate the death of Jesus during the Memorial celebration, two pioneers made a seventy-eight-mile trip to town from a farm where they work as contracted laborers, arriving late at night. The town guards arrested them, and after searching in vain to get something to convict them of, they were falsely charged with being in possession of some drugs. But soon they were freed at the police office. They enjoyed the Memorial celebration and returned to the farm greatly strengthened to continue their service to Jehovah despite losing two days’ pay and receiving twenty-four strokes from the farm manager.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The need is great in this vast territory where the Moslem religion prevails. The few who profess Christianity have been blinded by the image-worshiping religion of Christendom. A publisher reports: “In witnessing I met a Catholic who was greatly disturbed because, the night before, thieves broke into his home and cleared away all his property. With many maledictions he was invoking the ‘Virgin Mary’ to punish the thieves. I drew nearer and sympathized with him, telling him that the Bible foretold the present wicked days. Then I showed him that Jesus Christ, not Mary, is the one appointed to judge wicked men. From the Bible I showed him how the end of wickedness would come and then the safe new order will replace the present wicked system of things. He was consoled. The next Sunday I returned, placed a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font5"> booklet, and started a study. He was happy to learn the name of the true God. With my encouragement he obtained a Bible, from which I later proved to him that Mary was not ever virgin, but she had other children. Gratefully, he allowed the use of his home for a group study of the Bible. Though now fifty years old, he renounced the Catholic church as the ‘Devil’s tool’ and decided to share in preaching the good news to others. What </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a joy </span><span class="font5">to see this man with me in dispensing the Kingdom message! Though transferred to Cotonou, he met the brothers there and is having full association with them, both in meetings and in service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RIO MUNI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138,800</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,940</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rio Muni, that part of Spanish Guinea on the African mainland, is also receiving some witness concerning Jehovah’s government of righteousness. A district servant from Nigeria visited the brothers on several plantations and found that there are about ten brothers isolated from one another on nine plantations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,708,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,168 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 890</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another service year of joyful activity was engaged in by Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway. One of the problems they have had has been how to help the brothers to endure in the service. Materialism and increased prosperity have no doubt caused some to fall away, but the branch servant was very happy to report that by united efforts throughout the country one hundred inactive ones were helped to start out in the service again. This, of course, brought great pleasure to those who are conscious of their spiritual needs, and seeing these return to the field service helps them to continue on faithfully in the ministry. They know it is the only thing worth while in life. Here are some of the experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The climax of the year was the international ‘‘Word of Truth” Assembly in Oslo, June 17-20. The authorities were very willing to cooperate, the newspapers wrote about us in a commending way, and radio and television gave reports about the assembly. The publishers are being met with greater friendliness from persons who have seen and heard these programs. Publishers who worked in isolated territory during the summer tell how, even in the most distant places, the assembly has had a good influence and made a good impression. Several studies have been started as a direct result of the assembly. One day a woman made a telephone call to Bethel and said: “Excuse me for calling, but my husband and I attended your big assembly and became very interested, and now we want to learn more. We bought some literature, which we have read, and we have tried to study the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, but there are quite a few things we do not understand. Do you have someone to send to help us study?” An appointment was made at once, and a study was started on the first call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Friendliness brings good results, as this experience shows: “Before I learned the truth, one of my neighbors and I were members of a group of musicians associated with the Inner Mission. When I learned the truth, I left the group. My neighbor got very upset because of this, thinking that I had left Christianity. She used all opportunities to demonstrate her contempt for me and my family, and she shouted offending words to the Witnesses who visited me. It was quite impossible to get in contact with her and give her a witness. When her efforts brought no results, she changed tactics. She chose different scriptures, which she wrote down on pieces of paper and left on the stairs for me to read. It was still impossible for me to get in contact with her, so I decided to write her a letter. I thanked her for thinking of me with God’s Word, and I said I was happy that we both respected God’s Word, the Bible. I then briefly commented on the scriptures she had written. And what were the results? She saw to it that she met me in the hall and said, ‘How can you be so kind to me when I treat you the way I do?’ I was able to give her a brief witness, and she invited me to come in and asked several questions. I read an article from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> to her that gave an answer to one of her questions. While I was reading we both got tears of joy in our eyes because the Bible brought us together again. I gave her the magazine, and she thanked me for the visit. One hour later she knocked at my door. She had read the magazine and asked if she could have more of them. The next day we started a Bible study in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font5"> She progressed rapidly and today she is a zealous minister who is using all opportunities to witness about Jehovah God and his Kingdom, all because a publisher showed friendliness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PAKISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 100,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 169 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 591,716</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The need for publishers to give a witness to the Kingdom in Pakistan is very great, as there is only one publisher for 591,716 inhabitants. The same is true in Afghanistan, where a few brothers have gone to serve in the capital, Kabul. Here again there is a tremendous field that has hardly been touched as far as witnessing is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nevertheless, the brothers in Pakistan were happy to have 169 publishers reporting service during April. This was the result of the servants’ working hard to encourage all the irregular and inactive ones to share in the service. The attendance of 369 persons at the Memorial was also very encouraging, as this is the highest attendance ever and was more than one-third higher than last year. This shows there are fine prospects for continued increase of the work in Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch reports that the congregations are short of qualified brothers and there is a great need for more workers throughout the entire field. In the southern area of the country there are just two congregations and three isolated groups. In the north there are also two congregations and two isolated groups. But between the two areas there is a distance of approximately 500 miles where there are no publishers. With missionary groups serving at Karachi, Rawalpindi and Lahore, it can easily be seen that half the brothers have to travel at least 800 to 900 miles each way for a district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there are about 50,000,000 people who live in East Pakistan, and there is freedom to witness freely there. It is possible for people, particularly from Commonwealth countries, to enter, and it would be fine if some brothers could be giving a witness in Dacca, the capital. Of course, East Pakistan is Moslem territory, the same as West Pakistan, but doubtless some “sheep” could be gathered in that area, as has been the case in West Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries have been given encouragement during the year to work hard to learn Urdu. Even in the larger cities such as Karachi where English is widely spoken there is a definite need for the brothers serving there who really want to aid in giving a witness to men of all kinds to learn this language in order to give a thorough witness.—Acts 20:25, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AFGHANISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five brothers, serving where the need is great, are still faithfully serving in Afghanistan. The congregation overseer writes: “Though the report shows only a decrease in publishers, the joy, happiness and thankfulness are increasing. Can you imagine the joy of our small group to have the circuit servant visit from more than 500 miles away? Can you imagine our joy to have a showing of one of the Society’s films to a little group of twelve gathered for our first film showing? Indeed, it shows how Jehovah is concerned and cares for all his servants, whether they are in large congregations or in isolated territories. We are enjoying all the provisions of Jehovah through his organization and receiving richer blessings, to the glory of his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,243,860</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,429 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 870</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ministers of the Kingdom have continued faithfully to preach the Word of God in Panama and have had good results in spite of the poor economic conditions, which have forced some to leave the country to seek employment elsewhere. There has also been a slackening of the hand on the part of some; but now, since the Society has urged the servants in the congregations to make calls on inactive ones, they have had a number of very happifying experiences. If one is alert to all the opportunities, more Bible study could be done with those who have at one time been active but who have slackened their hand, in addition to studying with interested persons. Herewith is a report by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An experience sent in by a circuit servant shows what a hold on a person the desire to gamble can get and how much patience and perseverance are required to help interested ones get free from this slavery. He writes: “Some years ago I started a Bible study in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book with a man in the Palo Seco Leper Colony. The attendance at the study grew to five lepers within a few weeks. After about a year they were still studying, but none of them had come to the point of dedication, because of lottery buying. The study was turned over to another brother, as I left to do circuit work. He continued patiently studying with them and explained to them articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> about gambling and lottery playing and the position of a Christian. The Word, which is sharper than any two-edged sword, finally had its effect. Imagine my delight when the district servant and I recently visited that congregation and the district servant gave the baptismal talk to the same little group with whom I had studied two years before. A bathtub had been filled, and present with us was the one-legged leper who had been the first to start studying and who now symbolized his dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. In the near future there may be yet others there who make the break from the old system of things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One’s own family may sometimes be overlooked in the desire to help others learn about the true God, Jehovah. A brother had been attending meetings and participating in the house-to-house ministry for several years but never had been able to get his wife to come along with him. In fact, he found that she did not cooperate at all in helping him to get to the meetings on time and out into the field ministry. What could he do? In talking with the circuit servant it was suggested that he start a Bible study in his own home with his children, so this was begun. No sooner had they got started than the wife began to listen and take part. The result now is that there is harmony in the family and they all work together to get to the meetings on time. The brother is overjoyed at having his wife go right along with him as they both publish the Word of truth. All this because a regular Bible study was started in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PAPUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;543,235</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 416 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,306</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everywhere nationalism is on the upsurge and this is true in the islands of the South Pacific, especially those under the supervision of the branch in Papua. Persons led by the spirit of nationalism often mistreat Jehovah’s witnesses, who wish to remain neutral at all times. Because they carry out their assignment from Jehovah God to preach this good news of the Kingdom pressure is brought upon them from various sources. Since Christian parents know they must keep themselves without spot from the world, they try to train their children in the same manner, and with good success in most instances. The branch office sent in very interesting experiences from Papua, Manus Island, New Britain, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The careful discharge of responsibility brings good results, as is seen from the following experience sent in by the circuit servant. He writes: “Just a few months before our last circuit assembly a young publisher and her brother successfully persevered in a test of their stand on neutrality. For two weeks their teacher stood them before the school assembly after the flag-salute ceremony and tried to force them publicly to act contrary to their conscientious beliefs. Each time he was met with a refusal to do so, based on such scriptures as Exodus 20:4, 5. In trying to encourage the two young servants of God to break their integrity he would say: ‘All I want you to do is to salute just once, not for long.’ Seeing his efforts were in vain, he would ridicule the parents of the two children for bringing them up in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After several weeks of this the brothers went to see the teacher and pointed out clearly that he had no right to interfere with the freedom of worship of these children. This enraged him so that, later in the day, he struck the little boy on the hand with such force that it was fractured. When this was reported to his superior, he was soundly reprimanded. Since that time he has been most cooperative and has given the children time off for assemblies. Parental training in this important matter of neutrality does produce good fruit!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Success in the ministry does not depend on position or our own abilities, as is noted in these prophetic words: “ ‘Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,’ Jehovah of armies has said.” How well this was illustrated when a newly appointed special pioneer was assigned to open up the witness work in his home area, which is only about a hundred yards from the Anglican bishop’s headquarters in that area! From a brother who visited the pioneer after he had been in his assignment for only six weeks we have this report: “Brother---already has twenty Bible studies and an</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">average of eighteen persons attending the meetings he has arranged. The bishop has done everything possible to stop the spread of the truth in ‘his’ pasture. Messengers were sent out to all the villages instructing the people not to listen. Then the bishop arranged to visit the brother, as he was confident that he could win his points in an argument with this native man. The brother prepared prayerfully and invited all those with whom he studied to his home to hear the discussion. Came the day of the bishop’s visit, and all those with whom the brother studies were on hand when the bishop and his teachers arrived. Jehovah’s name, neutrality, celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal and baptism were discussed. It was not long before the bishop saw that he was unable to answer the arguments being put to him by the pioneer and so he determined to end the discussion by appealing to those gathered with the pioneer to remember that their church and his was the Anglican Church. ‘How many of you want to leave the church now and be Jehovah’s witnesses?’ To his question, thirty hands shot up into the air and one furious bishop hastily retreated!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MANUS ISLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19,417</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,942</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the young native sisters baptized last year was found to have been engaged in immoral conduct over a long period, and this caused a setback to the brothers and the work in this small community. However, the prompt action of the brothers in dealing with the situation when it came to their attention has done much to restore the confidence of the local people in the message and conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses. This is evident from the fact that at a recent showing of the Society’s new film over 640 persons attended in spite of a religious disturbance organized to prevent the orderly showing of the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW BRITAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123,072</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 67 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,837</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Sunday morning a young native couple walked up to the Kingdom Hall after finishing mass at the Catholic church. The man asked if they could sit down and listen. In one hour they had learned God’s name and that the present troubles that plague us will soon give way to a new order of righteousness. They were thrilled at understanding the meaning of the Scriptures quoted in the Bible study. The man had been a Methodist but had left the church because of the bad conduct of some who were always at church. When he got married he became a Catholic, for that was his wife’s religion. This lasted until they heard Jesus’ voice through God’s Word at a Bible study. They walked over two miles that first night to attend the meeting and have not missed since, even though they have received several visits from the priests to try to persuade them to stop listening. Now they are sharing the good news with others so that they also can hear Jesus’ words and come into Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,268,318</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 286 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,435</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past few years there has been a spectacular increase in the number of Witnesses in this country. With such a large number of new ones coming in during those years, it is not surprising to see that our increase is smaller this year. Much work has had to be done within the congregations in order to separate those who so quickly came into the organization but who had not really changed over their thinking and conduct. A number have decided they love the pleasures of the flesh more than God and these have had to be disfellowshiped in many cases for immorality. This cleaning out of those not desiring to change will lead to the free flow of Jehovah’s spirit upon the brothers in the coming year. A legal victory upholding our right to go from house to house uninvited to carry our theocratic message to the people has strengthened the brothers’ determination to press forward in the preaching work as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That Jehovah’s witnesses are beating “their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears” through their obedience to the principles of God’s Word can be seen in a recent experience of a circuit servant serving an isolated group. He says: “During my visit two men who were very bitter enemies came to the public talk at the Kingdom Hall. On their previous meeting, which was along a path in the kunai grass, these two men fought violently with axes and both received severe wounds, which necessitated their going to a hospital. Both have now been reached with the Kingdom message, which has helped them to see the need of a peaceful life together. Here they are sitting together in the Kingdom Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SOLOMON ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 429 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 303</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in this country are very thankful to Jehovah for a fine victory they received for freedom of worship this year. Due to pressure from false religionists local government authorities on Malaita ruled that it was indeed against the law for one of Jehovah’s witnesses to go into any village where the ground belonged to someone who did not want them to call. Right away these mission teachers called big meetings and, through pressure, began to close the villages to our work. At this stage the district servant, who was visiting the island in preparation for an assembly, called on the district commissioner. When he heard the complete story he ruled that it would be best for everyone concerned to get </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> ruling from the government headquarters in Honiara. Soon the decision came back. The Witnesses cannot legally be stopped from entering a village to preach just because the land, given to the people for their homes, belongs to one opposed to the work. It would remain up to the individual householder either to accept or to reject the message. Just imagine the chagrin of the mission leaders as they were then instructed by the government to call other meetings to explain that Jehovah’s witnesses could not be barred from any village just because one person disliked them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Illustrating why Jehovah’s witnesses must always be careful to provide a good example in the paying of taxes is the experience coming from M---. Recently</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">one of the mission teachers went to the local police station at M---complaining about our work and tell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing the local native sergeant of police that the government should put Jehovah’s witnesses in jail as they are such troublemakers. However, it was during the time that taxation was being paid, and the sergeant in replying said: “If I put anyone in gaol, I think that it should be you people, for none of you have paid your taxes yet, but all of Jehovah’s witnesses have done so. What is more, they were the first ones to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PARAGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;1,850,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The brothers in this South American country rejoice that there was an abundance of spiritual food received during the year through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine and other publications. They are grateful, too, for the district and circuit servants’ service in visiting the congregations regularly. Another cause for joy is the visible evidence of expansion, the new branch and missionary home just completed! It is a fine two-story concrete and brick structure with a Kingdom Hall large enough to accommodate 150 persons. There are also rooms for a fine branch office and bedrooms to accommodate fourteen workers. The branch servant gives us an interesting report on the work done this past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applying the counsel to make friendly visits on opposed or uninterested men brings results. A woman learned the truth and loved it, but, because she was living with a man without the benefits of marriage, she could not be a publisher nor be baptized in symbol of an acceptable dedication to Jehovah. For ten years she tried to get the man to marry her but without success and, because he was the sole means of support of her and their seven children and also because she loved him and wanted him too to have the truth, she did not leave him. She taught the children what she believed and in time three of the older ones began to publish. Various brothers visited the man over a period of time, not just to preach to him, but to get to know him and to talk about his work, his interest in nature and in the abundant variety of plants and trees that interested him and that he had planted in his patio. The man responded to the friendly attention and at assembly time agreed to take the entire family to a circuit assembly to see one of his daughters baptized. The peace and happiness of the brothers at the assembly made a deep impression on him, with the result that exactly two weeks later he decided to marry his “woman” of nineteen years, thus legitimatizing their relationship and the status of their seven children and opening the way for her to enjoy service privileges as she did the very next day. His desire now is to learn more about Jehovah and his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine routes often produce wonderful results. A brother placed two magazines with an elderly woman in a local corner store and, on making a return call to place the next issues, established a regular route because the woman insisted that he bring her every issue. But he also found out that the woman could not read a word. Why did she want the magazines? They were for her daughter’s family of four, all of them interested in reading the magazines. One day the publisher met the husband in the store and was thanked by him for being so faithful in bringing the magazines to his mother-in-law, who, in turn, sent them on to the family. A back-call was made on the family and a Bible study was started immediately, with the result that four months later the man’s wife and a daughter began publishing and plan to be baptized at the next assembly. The husband and another daughter of his also show good interest. All this came from starting and faithfully maintaining a magazine route with a woman who could not read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Populations &nbsp;&nbsp;12,014,000</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses are truly a people set apart, not because of any man-made whim of their own choosing, but because Jehovah God requires it of them. Being his name people, carrying on true worship of him in spirit and truth, they cannot compromise or soil themselves with the Devil’s system of things. Many problems have been raised in Peru during the past year, but the brothers are standing firm and there has been a fine increase of 16 percent in the average number of publishers engaging in Kingdom service. Here is one very interesting experience sent in by the branch servant.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s new film has played a large part in exposing the fall of Babylon the Great. After a circuit assembly a small congregation of sixteen publishers arranged for the showing of the film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World.” They asked for permission to use the local Employee’s Club, which offered excellent accommodations for the showing in the small mining town of 8,000 people. The brothers were advised by the mining company officials that they could not give permission until the brothers submitted a synopsis of the film so they could pass approval on it. The brothers remembered the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article on the film when it was first released, so they looked up the information, epitomized it and submitted it to the officials. Permission was quickly granted in the form of a letter to the manager of the club to provide Jehovah’s witnesses with every facility in order to make their film showing a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the arrangements had been made a month in advance, the news had not got around to the local priest. Only when a spot announcement on the radio was made advertising the film did he learn that Jehovah’s witnesses were sponsoring a movie. He did all in his power to have the permission given by the club rescinded, but to no avail. He did succeed in having the radio announcements canceled, but his move was too late to be effective. Everyone by then had heard about it. At 4 p.m. of the day arranged for, when the district servant got there to make the final arrangements, people were already arriving to save seats. By 7 p.m., the hour to start, there was not even standing room left, and this in spite of the fact that the priest had warned his parishioners not to attend the film as it was only for Jehovah’s witnesses. When the film was finished, the attendant captain reported 3,251 present to hear how Babylon the Great has fallen. And guess who was there! The priest had slipped in right after the lights went out and had seen and heard the complete showing. He tried to leave before the lights went on again, but the press of the crowd held him back. As he finally got out he went through the crowd mocking the film, and in sing-song fashion cried out, “Babylon the Great has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!” The remark made by someone in the crowd, “He sings his own epitaph,” was heard by many. People still talk about the impact of the film upon honest-hearted people in the mining town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippine Islands are giving good coverage to the country with the good news of the Kingdom. A special effort was made this year to work unassigned territory. Last year was the first time the branch office sent special pioneers out to work in unassigned small towns and villages, and they had some very fine experiences and were able to help a number of persons who had lost track of the truth but could now be revived. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant dealing with many subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the service year was the visit last December of Brother Knorr as part of his tour of branch offices in this part of the world. Certainly we all benefited very much from the fine counsel given to help us serve the brothers in the field more effectively. We arranged a meeting with the local congregations on the Wednesday evening of the visit at the Manila Jockey Club Grandstand and we invited around ninety congregations in and around Manila, expecting to have about 4,000 in attendance. Imagine our joy when it was announced that 7,463 were present, some even coming by plane from as far away as Mindanao ! It was truly a happy throng that heard Brother Knorr’s encouraging remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Schoolchildren who suffer trials because of their faith can draw much encouragement from the following experience involving an eight-year-old girl in the province of Agusan, Mindanao. The little sister and several of her Witness classmates had been continually pressured by the school faculty to sing the national anthem and salute the flag, but they refused to compromise their faith. One day the ceremony was held as usual, but before it ended these young witnesses of Jehovah were called upon to go to the microphone and sing the national anthem. Similar to the three young Hebrews, the group complied with the instruction to the extent permitted by their conscience and they went to the microphone. However, instead of singing the national hymn, they sang song No. 80 from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Songbook,</span><span class="font5"> which is entitled “Pay What Belongs to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following afternoon the eight-year-old girl took along a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> that dealt with the outcome of the flag-salute case in Liberia and gave it to her teacher to read. After reading the article the teacher completely changed his attitude toward the Witnesses and he never again tried to force them to violate their Christian conscience. Now a Bible study is being conducted with the teacher by the little girl’s brother—all because young publishers held a strong faith against overwhelming odds! Truly, “out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.”—Matt. 21:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How deep is your appreciation for congregation meetings? In northern Luzon in mountainous territory </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">sixty-eight-year-old brother lives forty kilometers from the nearest Kingdom Hall and, since there are no roads from his house to the town proper, he walks this distance in order to attend meetings. In view of his age and the fact that his left leg is weakened due to a previous fracture, he walks quite slowly, necessitating his leaving home the day before the meeting so as to get there on time. Yet the circuit servant reports that he never misses a meeting and is always on time He has been a regular pioneer for the past four years and he regularly meets his goal of hours. As he himself says: “I am a happy man because, although I did not remember my Creator in my youth, I am able to do so now during my gray-haired years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;9,470,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,839 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,336</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Freedom to worship one’s God is a wonderful thing, but that freedom does not exist in Portugal, not for those who claim to be Jehovah’s witnesses. There are many countries in the world that permit religious liberty and they back up their statements by giving freedom. But in a country such as Portugal, where Babylon the Great holds such power and is able to influence the high government officials and make the police force decide against freedom of worship, it certainly is difficult for those who want to serve the true God, Jehovah, to do so. When one reads what Jehovah’s witnesses have to go through in Portugal to serve God it takes one back to the days of Hitler, and the Catholic church was behind that regime also. The Society is pleased to give a report of what is going on in Portugal, Angola, the Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira and Sao Tome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prejudiced government officials have made such false statements as, Jehovah’s witnesses are “a danger to the safety of the state,” “subversive,” “anti-social” and that they are “of a movement with ambitious political ends which in many respects is similar to other totalitarian movements.” During the year many more homes of the brothers have been searched and religious literature has been confiscated. Some have been taken off to jail or to be questioned, while still others have had the annoyance of being followed by plainclothesmen for days on end. Several who were arrested while attending meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses or who were conducting home Bible studies have been brought to trial for “illegal meetings” or belonging to an “antisocial” group. The final outcome of these cases is not known as yet, but it is evident that the government is hesitant to bring such charges out in the open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother V--- is an active witness of Jehovah even</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">though he is seventy-three years of age. Early in the year the police visited his home and took away his personal religious literature and during the month of August he was called down twice to the local police station. On the second occasion he was forced to submit to a “third degree” type of interrogation, having to stand on his feet for five hours of questioning without letup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a small town some distance from Lisbon, Sister C--- has been hounded by the police so much that it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">finally became necessary for her to leave the area. She had been followed for days, arrested and held at police headquarters without charge, and several times her home had been invaded and searched. Once this woman, who is seventy years old, was held in prison for thirty-two hours without being given any food whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A notice to appear at the local police station was received by Brother C—— and he presented himself</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">there at the appointed time. For two hours his religion was ridiculed and attempts were made to make him change his mind as to his religious ideas. When this failed, one of the policemen carefully closed the doors and windows of the room, and Brother C--- was</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cruelly beaten on the head and stomach. When he fell unconscious to the floor he was picked up by his ears and beaten again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of this writing two of our brothers have been in prison for over three months, held without charge. They had been arrested while taking part in a religious meeting. All efforts to help them have failed; they have been denied visitors and are not allowed any reading material. From these incidents it can be seen that Jehovah’s witnesses in Portugal have suffered much during the past year. In spite of this they have put forth a great effort to find the “other sheep” as can be seen by the 25-percent increase in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About 350 Portuguese brothers had the wonderful privilege of attending the “Word of Truth” Assembly in Switzerland and came away with a yet deeper appreciation for Jehovah’s organization. It made no difference that so few Portuguese could attend. A large platform with beautiful illustrations and flowers was erected, with an elaborate sound system, just as had been set up for the German-, French-, Italian- and Spanish-speaking brothers who attended. All this preparation and organization, along with the fact that Brother Knorr took time from his busy schedule to talk personally to the Portuguese from their platform, gave a vivid reminder that Jehovah really loves his “sheep” and cares for them, even the very smallest. The Portuguese government tried hard to stop our brothers from attending. Fifty who obtained collective passports were told just the day before their departure that their passports were canceled. When the police learned of a busload of brothers that had just left, they telephoned the border to stop it, but the bus had already passed through customs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not sure what the new year will hold. It appears that the government is tightening up in its campaign, and the brothers will have to suffer yet more persecution. They are prepared for this and are following the advice of “the faithful and true witness” Christ Jesus: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test, and that you may have tribulation ten days. Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,605,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 114 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 40,395</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work is being carried on under the greatest of difficulties. The authorities are relentless in their surveillance of the brothers, and the police have followed some for days, from morning to night. At the time of this writing, news has reached us that another brother has been thrown into prison without charge, leaving his family dependent on others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although little information about the conditions in Angola reaches the outside, it is known that there is a constant struggle being waged between the Portuguese government and an independence movement. Due to their fear of the terrorists, the authorities have been overzealous in rooting out opposition, and innocent people have had to suffer. Among these are Jehovah’s witnesses. They have been accused of all sorts of political maneuverings, and bold statements have been made by officials in the newspapers, but never is any evidence offered to prove what is said. These accusations are coupled with statements that the Catholic church is the church of the Portuguese and that others are not needed. From this it is clear where many of the accusations originate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When several brothers completed their three-year prison sentence for being Jehovah’s witnesses, they were called before the authorities and told they would now be granted their freedom if they would deny their religion and abandon it. They replied that they would rather die than renounce their faith in God, and so have been returned to confinement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These brothers need the prayers of all of us, and we hope that in the near future Jehovah will see fit to relieve conditions in Angola, as there are many hundreds of interested persons waiting to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AZORES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,193</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in other small places, the lives of the inhabitants of the islands of the Azores are interwoven and what each one does is common knowledge to everyone else. So when a person becomes one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the predominantly Catholic population begins to shun him and his life becomes difficult. It is then that Jesus’ words in John 15:19 are fulfilled: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” Especially is this so when an organized hate campaign is launched against us. The local Catholic church has issued a series of bulletins attacking the witnesses of Jehovah and has sent people from house to house to slip these under the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in other Portuguese territories, the articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> about religious persecution in Portugal caused quite a stir. In one congregation the police called the congregation servant down to headquarters for a talk about the matter. They wanted to know how many copies of the magazines there were and demanded that all be turned over to them. The chief referred to a government decree that called Jehovah’s witnesses “subversive,” and when the brother began to offer his defense from the Scriptures and use the name Jehovah, the chief shouted, “Don’t use that name! If you do again I’ll have you thrown into prison!” The brother responded by saying that he had to use this name if he was to defend himself and that, anyway, taking a Catholic missal from his bag, the Catholic church itself uses the name. He then showed where the name “Jehovah” is given in the missal. The brother was then able to give a good witness to the small group of policemen, and was finally released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPE VERDE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 25,714</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in other Portuguese territories, the work in the islands has met with stiff opposition from the government as well as church authorities. Door-to-door work is almost an impossibility, but there are other ways to help interested persons to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,769</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Along with having to cope with the difficult terrain of the island, the brothers are faced with many obstacles due to the firm hold that the Catholic church has over the people. One sister had for a long time been careful not to tell her Catholic relatives that she was a Witness, fearing the persecution she might receive from her family. One day, however, when out in the service, she happened to knock at the door where one of her relatives was staying. Rather than back away from the opportunity, she decided to give a witness, and some literature, including a bound book, was placed, although not due to any apparent interest but only family courtesy. The relative hid the book away, as she was ashamed for the rest of the family to see it, and it was soon forgotten. Sometime later she came upon the book and secretly began to study it, especially where the responsibilities of a Christian wife were mentioned. Her husband, also a devout Catholic, began to notice a change in his wife. She became more conscious of her wifely duties, and the whole family began to benefit from it. When he finally found out the reason, the husband gave his approval and a regular family study was arranged. The woman is now a publisher of the good news and is helping the rest of the family to progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the local police find nothing wrong with Jehovah’s witnesses, they are forced to take action due to pressure from their superiors. Bible literature has been confiscated and several brothers have been called down to police headquarters for questioning. This affords a good opportunity to witness, and the police have been very impressed with the sincerity and politeness of Jehovah’s witnesses. Several officers now greet the brothers when they pass on the street and have apologized for the actions they are forced to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SAO TOMfi &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 16,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though they have been ill-treated and persecuted by the authorities, the small group of brothers on the island of Sao Tome have remained faithful to their dedication vows. Since threats of beatings and added imprisonments could not stop the preaching work, it was decided that the best way to deal with Jehovah’s witnesses would be &quot;divide and conquer.” So several brothers were moved to the neighboring island of Principe. Rather than discouraging the spread of the Kingdom message, it has resulted in two isolated groups, and for the first time the Word of truth is being preached on the island of Principe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother writes: “Brothers, here in Sao Tome we are working very hard in preaching the Word of God to the point that a booklet published by the church reports that there are other pastors, those called Jehovah’s witnesses, but that these are from Satan and doomed to everlasting fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only do the local conditions put a great test upon the integrity of these brothers, but also the great distance between them and their brothers of like faith does so. They need our prayers and, when considering them, we should keep in mind Paul’s words in 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3: &quot;We always thank God when we make mention concerning all of you in our prayers, for we bear incessantly in mind your faithful work and your loving labor and your endurance due to your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,460,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,361 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 732</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much excellent work was done on the islands under the Puerto Rican branch during the past year. Jehovah’s witnesses were extremely active and accomplished much in gathering together and bringing to maturity those who are interested. They enjoyed a 14-percent increase during the past twelve months, and this means that the Puerto Rican people will get an even greater witness because the territory will be covered even more often. Now that they have the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font6"> in Spanish, they are looking forward to even more Bible studies and will try to arouse more interest in God’s kingdom in that land. The branch servant, with an office in San Juan, gives us a report on Puerto Rico, Tortola and the United States Virgin Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An assistant congregation servant set a fine example for the rest of the brothers during the month of July. He applied for vacation pioneer service and was happy and ready to begin on the first of the month. After four days he became ill, and the doctor said he would have to rest. The brother, however, had a great desire to continue as a pioneer, and did so, and was soon better in health. Then a few days later he received a very lucrative offer—twenty days of work at $50 a day, or $1,000 in three weeks, but, of course, no time for vacation pioneering. The brother rejected this offer and continued his pioneering. At the end of the month he felt refreshed. He had turned back materialistic temptations and said: “Why, no amount of money on earth could possibly pay for the experiences and rich blessings that I have enjoyed this month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lady who was studying with a publisher had a great desire to attend the Memorial. For a whole month she pleaded with her husband, asking him to take her. Finally, he consented to do so. He was so impressed with the meeting and with the love and unity of the brothers that he asked his wife to see if she could get a brother to study with him. At the end of May a married couple visited him and answered his many questions. However, the brother was a servant in the local congregation and already had five home Bible studies and just could not see his way clear to take on another one. He explained this to the man and said he would see what he could do but that the ‘harvest is great and workers few.’ To the publisher’s surprise, the man said: “That is no problem; you just come here and study with me and then I will help you study with these other people.” The publisher left that night with his sixth study arranged. Now the man has been to a circuit and a district assembly, attends all the meetings with his whole family, participates in the Theocratic Ministry School, takes part in the field service and is considering baptism. And all this has occurred in just three months!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many persons in Puerto Rico are fleeing from Babylon the Great and are using their God-given freedom to help others. While a study was in progress, the niece of the lady of the house came in wearing a religious habit. She sat down and listened. After the study she asked if it was correct to wear such a dress, which was, in fact, in fulfillment of a promise made to a certain “saint.” The publisher tactfully replied that the Bible has the answer. After a detailed discussion the young lady said that she was going to take off the religious habit because she could see from the Bible that it was not right to wear it. However, to avoid problems with her family she kept it on for two more weeks. On the Monday when she took it off, she began studying the Bible with the Witness. On Tuesday she came to the congregation book study. The following Sunday she appeared at the Kingdom Hall to take part in field service. Three weeks later she began to teach her mother the good things she was learning. Since then she has been a regular meeting attender, was baptized and two weeks later began vacation pioneering. She now conducts three home Bible studies and is helping others to flee from Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth makes a good impression on young folks, as is seen by the following experience: A mother studied for quite some time but did not progress much and after a while stopped studying. Her little daughter, too, had joined in. Later on, since the daughter went to a Catholic school, the mother felt obligated to take the girl to mass. She herself did not go into the church but sent the girl inside. Outside on the church property there was a bingo game in progress and alcoholic drinks were being served. The little girl said: “Mother, I don’t like being here. They don’t do this at the Kingdom Hall.” This caused the mother’s conscience to prick her, so she phoned a brother and said she wanted to start her study again to take a firm stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TORTOLA (British Virgin Islands)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,760</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 370</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of preaching the good news continues to progress in these islands. Many publishers have moved away due to the difficult living conditions, and so the congregation has fewer publishers than a year ago. This constant movement can be disheartening because good home Bible studies are started and then after a short while the people move off the island and the publisher has to start all over again. This requires love and patience, and the brothers have shown these qualities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About two years ago a young lady subscribed for the magazines and soon a study was started. For about a year progress was slow and so, finally, a shift was made to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> book and this, being a deeper study, stirred up more interest in the student. After studying a few chapters in this book, she began accompanying the publisher in the door-to-door work. Although she lives far from town, she made the effort to come to the Kingdom Hall. However, as the apostle Paul said: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (2 Tim. 3:12) Recently, the lady’s husband joined a Baptist group and shortly thereafter all her literature, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> books, magazines, and so forth, disappeared. But she had strong faith and has been able to withstand such persecution in the family and is more determined than ever to continue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A sister tells how, after reading in a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> about offering Bibles at motels and hotels, she and her husband decided to try it. Her husband showed a hotel manager the Scripture comparisons with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> and he was so impressed that he ordered eighteen, one for each room in the hotel. As the Bibles were being delivered the next morning, a lady approached the sister and said: “So you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses. My mother and four sisters are Witnesses and I am so glad to meet you here.” Arrangements were made to visit this person and help her learn the way of life. So from following the example of an experience much seed was sown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RHODESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,260,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As do many parts of Africa, Rhodesia has its problems. There is constant unrest in many African countries. Rhodesia, as yet, has not settled its political worries. But Jehovah’s witnesses have a work to do despite political upheavals, and their work is to preach the good news of God’s kingdom, which is the only hope for mankind and is the only government that can bring peace to all the people. It has been difficult during these years of internal turmoil to bring about any increase. However, there are people every year who hear the truth and dedicate their lives to Jehovah God. It seems that as quickly as some take their stand for the truth others either leave the country or leave the organization for one reason or another. But the faithful publishers are not discouraged. They continue declaring the good news, to the benefit of all. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Political pressure was felt in various sections of the country, but the brothers have not been affected to any great extent by this persecution. One overseer was wrongly charged with sharing in some of these political uprisings and was sentenced to prison for three months. The brothers at the Branch immediately appealed on his behalf for a review of his case, but things did not move quickly. A full month passed before his release came, and we were then happy to have him with us again. Upon his return he visited Bethel and told us of the very difficult time he experienced while in prison, due to maltreatment by political mobsters. During his imprisonment, on two occasions he was severely beaten by these men until unconscious. They termed these beatings “lessons” to teach him to become a political man. Despite such treatment, he emerged even stronger spiritually and more determined to proclaim the good news of God’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind rather than any political ideology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the month of April all congregation publishers were encouraged to vacation pioneer if at all possible, and what a grand climax this resulted in when we reached the total of 611 sharing and reporting. The previous all-time peak was 160 for one month. Many were the letters written to the office expressing appreciation for this privilege of service. One said: “When I took up the vacation pioneer ministry I did not think that I was going to meet the goals, because my husband is not interested in the truth and he opposes me. But when I took up the pioneer service I found that he was making some changes and I was getting time for the ministry easily. I enjoyed vacation pioneering very, very much. In only one week I placed ten books, eight booklets and forty-eight magazines. This was a surprise to me, for ever since I have been a publisher I never placed so much literature about God’s kingdom. I know that Jehovah blessed me because I did not resist his counsel and I put my trust in him.” Another letter tells that a brother had never been able to obtain a new subscription since the time of his dedication, but that during his three months of vacation pioneering he obtained four. And another letter reads: “I am very glad to notify you about the happiness we had in April. We enjoyed very much the extra preaching work. Our congregation had fourteen vacation pioneers during April. We were doing the service until 10:30 many nights, and we thank the Society for encouraging us to serve in this way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are attending school are also being tested as to their love for Jehovah and what is right. Many have been the problems handled by the Society in connection with schoolteachers’ trying to force our children to attend Sunday school and also weekend sports. In every case where this has been a problem and where parents and children have taken a firm, consistent stand for what is right, a settlement has been arranged, to the vindication of Jehovah’s people. A circuit servant reports that one overseer had this problem in his congregation, so he personally went to see the schoolteacher to discuss the matter. The schoolteacher argued that at Sunday school the children learned the same things about God that the parents of Jehovah’s witnesses teach theirs, but the overseer did not agree to this. So the teacher asked the overseer to tell him what he taught his children. As the letter from the circuit servant said: “Then the brother told his younger son to give a Bible sermon to the teacher, which he did. The teacher was very much amazed! So the teacher said to the overseer: ‘Please, will you do everything you can to come to our church every Sunday morning to teach our children just as you have trained yours?’ Needless to say, from that day the children were not pressured into attending Sunday school. And the overseer now has a home Bible study with the teacher.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 515 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,234</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we look at the ratio of publishers to the population in Sierra Leone, we realize that there is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done in this country. Jehovah’s witnesses there are trying to do it. Several things that they have been trying to improve during the year include greater efficiency in the back-call work and more productive home Bible studies. These things are essential if one is to get a knowledge of the truth. The branch servant reports that some good progress was made toward achieving more literacy among those who cannot read. Their most recent survey shows that 69 percent of the brothers are now literate, and, with the exception of one particular section of the country, 82 percent of the brothers are literate. This is very fine for Sierra Leone and it shows that those who have a knowledge of the truth are certainly helping those who are coming into the organization and aiding them to learn how to read and write. The branch servant in Sierra Leone sends in reports on Gambia and the Republic of Guinea, as well as Sierra Leone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conditions in Sierra Leone make it possible for people in all stations in life to be given a witness concerning the true God and his purposes. Most of the major towns are now being served either by a congregation or an isolated group, although there is a large number of smaller communities that have not yet heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and the fine work they are doing. We are glad, however, that during the year, through publicity given in the press on blood transfusion, we were able to reach some of these places when two of the missionaries were invited to answer questions from the Bible on a half-hour program that was broadcast on the national radio on two different occasions at peak listening time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes the aged show more alertness and response to the truth than much younger ones. A back-call was made on an old woman thought to be upward of a hundred years of age. When told by the brother that her gods of wood and stone were helpless gods, she replied in a loud voice: “Do you say these are helpless gods that will be destroyed and those that keep them will perish with them?” “Yes,” was the direct reply of the brother. “Then how can I get life?” she asked. “I am old and I have never learned to read or write.” The pioneer brother explained that she was not too old to study the Bible with his help. The woman expressed her desire to come out of darkness into the light before her death. A Bible study was started, and soon with a merry heart she was attending the congregational meetings, never missing one week. One day she called to the pioneer and asked: “What is to be done now before my death to prove I am a real witness of Jehovah?” The requirements for the ministry and baptism were explained, and now for the past few weeks as she preaches to others she has been awaiting news of the next circuit assembly so she can be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adhering to the principle of honesty is a requirement for sharing in the life-giving ministry. A new publisher had his honesty put to the test. Some of his workmates arranged among themselves to steal equipment from the workshop. He refused to join them. When the theft was discovered, the brother was accused by the thieves. But the brother had proved himself honest and reliable in the past, for no equipment in his care had ever been missing. The truth gradually came out, resulting in the real culprits’ being dismissed from their jobs and the brother’s being retained in his position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The heart appreciation that motivates one to take a positive stand for the truth and right principles reminds us of the situation that Jesus described when speaking of those who, after being healed, “turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.” (Luke 17:15) For example, during the zone servant’s visit in February one young man symbolized his dedication to God by immersion. He had no more than come out of the water when he voiced his desire to be a vacation pioneer. He reported his first month as a vacation pioneer in April. He continued every month thereafter in the service year, averaging 106 hours per month. Indeed, he glorified God “with a loud voice,” becoming the first vacation or regular pioneer reporting in Gambia in the last six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the service year coming to a close, we received the good news that our literature could be imported into Gambia duty free. Now with a new branch office opening in Dakar, Senegal, to look after the work in Gambia, it appears that there are some fine prospects for expansion in the months ahead. We pray that many more hearts will be reached as a result of this fine arrangement for Gambia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Good results can be obtained if one boldly but kindly persists in declaring the hope of God’s kingdom to those of his own village. A young pioneer brother bore in mind the words of 1 Peter 2:19, 20. This helped him to endure several unjust imprisonments because of his faith in God’s Word. A local chief would not tolerate any other religion than his own Catholic teaching in his village and in others around. So this ardent pioneer whose faith moved him to preach in this village was arrested, molested and sent to jail. A few weeks later he was released. Using the Bible as his authority, he continued to preach, but was soon again arrested and charged with creating confusion in the village. Again he was detained for days and then released. No sooner was he released, than he returned to his village to continue his preaching. He was arrested a third time, but this time at the police station he was identified by an officer who remembered that he along with other Witnesses at one time had held a study with him in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book in French. After inquiring of the pioneer as to why he was there, the police officer called the local chief for interrogation. The policeman soon observed that the chief was wrong in taking action against the young brother. The chief was then warned not to bring the pioneer up to the charge office again, “unless he fights or disturbs the peace.” He then added: “Reading or teaching God’s word from the Bible is not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> crime. I have many copies of their books. ... I enjoy having studies with them. They are good people.” The brother was then set free, with the policeman expressing sorrow over what he had suffered. Since then there has been absolute freedom of worship in the brother’s village and environs. It is a joy to report that many villagers now attend the service center, located near the chief’s house. Four of the villagers have joined the young pioneer in preaching in their own community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 16,002,797</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 20,186 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 793</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The population of the Republic of South Africa is made up of three million white people, two million colored people and Asiatics and eleven million Bantu. Jehovah has raised up witnesses from all sections of the country among all its inhabitants. The result has been that an excellent witness has been given throughout the entire land by Jehovah’s witnesses to the various peoples living in this southern part of Africa. The branch office, located in Elandsfontein, South Africa, also looks after the work in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. Interesting reports have been sent in by the branch servant on all these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children of dedicated African parents grow up in the atmosphere of Jehovah’s service from their infancy as they are carried upon the backs of their mothers. Their thoughts, not occupied with toys or many personal belongings, centre around theocratic activities. A four-year-old son of an overseer revealed how deeply the ministry has been implanted in his mind. As a group of publishers were leaving for field service, he looked dejected. Asked by his mother what was wrong, he expressed his feelings: “What kind of a brother am I? I don’t even have a witnessing case!’’ A sister, overhearing his remark, bought a small inexpensive cardboard box with a handle and clasp. When he removed the wrapping paper from this gift, his eyes and face lighted up. He delighted in putting a booklet, some tracts and handbills into his prized new case. During the remainder of the week he was keener than ever to share in the service. He knows the scriptures of the current sermon and can also discuss them when brought into the conversation. When asked now what kind of a brother he is, he proudly beams: “I’m a real brother with a witnessing case!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister went out in field service with three of her children in the car ranging from five to nine years. She left the two in the car while she took the youngest with her to conduct a home Bible study. These two decided that while the mother was busy they would place magazines that were left in the car rather than just sit and wait. Upon returning to the car, the mother was promptly informed that her eight magazines had been placed in that street. The children presented the correct change in payment for the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A district servant reports as follows: While visiting an African congregation with the circuit servant, we noted from the Publisher’s Record cards all the brothers and sisters who had good service averages and who could possibly be encouraged into full-time or vacation pioneer service. During the week we had a personal discussion with each of these publishers, pointed out their privileges, showed them the responsibilities resulting from their dedication, and, in some cases, assisted them to overcome problems hindering them from sharing in the service to a greater extent. Although these individuals could not yet see their way to enter into the full-time service, they promised to consider vacation pioneering for two weeks. Each was given a vacation pioneer form. To our surprise, after the final talk on Sunday, eight of these forms were completed and returned, not for just two weeks’ vacation pioneer service, but for two months. We considered this to be splendid in a congregation of seventy publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One day in February this year a sister who is a nurse at a hospital introduced the subject of blood transfusion to the nursing staff. This led to a daily discussion at teatime and lunch hour and developed into a study with three groups, covering </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> material on the subject and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blood, Medicine and the Law of God.</span><span class="font5"> At the end of February the sister took six weeks’ leave from her work to have a fuller share in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign, and when she returned she placed twenty-five magazines and ten subscriptions with the staff. Recently, she also placed the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font5"> with a doctor, and he is discussing the material in the book with her for about fifteen minutes every lunch hour. Thus, by courage and tact, we can introduce the truth to persons who are sometimes difficult to contact in our regular field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BASUTOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;650,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 244 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,664</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Basutoland is a mountainous country, being the highest point in southern Africa. In its mountains there are many settlements that have been almost untouched by the publishers thus far. Two brothers from Phamong congregation decided to visit one of these places, called Maluti, during their two weeks of vacation pioneering in December. They spent three days in this mountain village, working from early in the morning till late at night. Each of them devoted about fifty hours in the field service for the three days. They found the people most responsive and placed forty-four magazines, four bound books and five booklets. Considering that few people have cash money in Basutoland to take literature, these placements are excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the mountains, one can only travel a distance of thirty miles into Basutoland from the South African border with a motor vehicle. This makes travelling in Basutoland difficult, and the brothers and sisters often have to make great sacrifices to attend assemblies. Ten publishers walked about forty miles to attend an assembly at Mohale’s Hoek. The oldest was a sixty-year-old sister who walked all the way from Phamong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is customary in Basutoland for relatives and friends to gather at the home of a family who has lost a member in death. This usually takes place the evening before the funeral, and the purpose is to comfort the bereaved ones. During the evening speeches are often made by those present. Some of our brothers have been taking advantage of this by attending such gatherings, ready to give short talks on the condition of the dead. Some interesting experiences have resulted. For example, one brother reported as follows: “I realized I could reach many more people whom I often did not get at home in my pioneer assignment by attending these gatherings. So one day when an acquaintance of mine died, I went to his family’s home the evening before the funeral. I was prepared to give a discourse on the condition of the dead. So when the opportunity presented itself, I gave a half-hour talk, supporting everything from the Bible. All listened attentively. After the talk I was approached by a man who said: ‘Do you remember me? I chased you away from my house when you came to preach to me.’ I clearly recalled the incident. He then apologized for his actions, saying he did not know that what we taught came from the Bible. He said the talk he just heard opened his eyes. He asked for help to understand the Bible and invited me to call at his home. This I did at the earliest opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BECHUANALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;296,851</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bechuanaland covers an area of 222,000 square miles but it is sparsely populated and much of it is sandy and waterless. The Kalahari Desert comprises a large proportion of the country, and transport facilities are few. At certain seasons of the year’ many of the publishers are obliged to leave their homes to work out in the fields some distance away. In these circumstances it is difficult to carry forward the Kingdom work in the normal way, but the brothers in that country continue to do their best, and reports indicate that they have matured considerably during the year and are giving a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On visiting our brothers in Mahalapye, the circuit servant encouraged them to build their own Kingdom Hall and helped them to organize themselves so that each could contribute to the accomplishing of their goal. They are now making their own bricks, some days even up to 1,000. They already have 8,000 that are ready for use. It is hoped that by the end of the year Bechuanaland will have its first Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. HELENA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,600</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Although there was a new peak in publishers early in the present service year, the brothers suffered a loss in the death of two very zealous publishers in February and March, and with two vacation pioneers’ having to give up for health reasons, not to mention several publishers leaving the island, the figures have dropped. A good witness was given at the funeral of one of the brothers. Some 200 attended, including a director, the general manager and about 90 percent of the office staff and workmen of the company for whom the brother worked. One sister overheard a conversation of two men walking away after the funeral. One asked the other how he liked the service, and the other replied: “Well, what I wanted to know, now I know, that we have a hope.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is a very great need to teach the truth to the African people, and the European publishers need to use every opportunity to bring the truth to them. At one place in the north of South-West Africa two married couples felt that the Lutheran church to which they belonged was not giving them the necessary understanding of God’s Word. They were hungrily searching for the truth. This led them to contact a European sister who had made a practice of speaking about the truth to her African employees. One of the employees had told the two couples that they should contact the sister if they wanted to know more about the Bible. They asked the sister to teach them, but after two studies the sister and her husband moved to another town. The sister told the group of interested Africans that she would ask another publisher to continue with the study, but before this second sister could contact them, one of the group called on her and asked her for a study. By this time they were already spreading their new-found truths to others. For this they earned the condemnation of their Lutheran pastor, who organized a severe hate campaign against the group. They were immediately ostracised from the community and persecuted to such an extent that one of the group had to run for her life while a mob chased her with an axe and other weapons. The mob threatened to stone the group, calling out, “This is the day we claim your blood in revenge” (a Nama expression). The group of interested persons turned to the government authorities for protection, and these severely reproved the ones responsible for the attack and promised protection. Through all of this they maintained a fearless stand for true worship. Shortly after these happenings the circuit and district servant visited this town and a special showing of the film was arranged, with 300 in attendance, mainly due to the advertising done by these African students. Now special pioneers have been assigned to this territory, which has resulted in fast progress to maturity. Just before the close of the service year one of them was able to attend the circuit assembly 400 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SWAZILAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;237,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 533 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 445</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every year the Paramount Chief of Swaziland has an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Indaba</span><span class="font5"> (meeting) for all religions at the Royal Kraal. Each religious group sends a representative. Each is allowed fifteen minutes to express himself on religious matters. All take advantage of the occasion to court the favour of the King for their religion, hoping that theirs may be the favoured one when the country gets its independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year Jehovah’s witnesses were represented. The special pioneer, who is also congregation servant, gave his talk, proving each point by reading a text in the Bible. He showed that the greatest need was for the men who profess to be ministers to help their people to understand God’s Word so making better citizens of them; that this is more important than becoming involved in politics; that there is an urgent need to go to the homes of the people imitating the ministry of Christ Jesus, for ignorance of the Bible is widespread in Swaziland. At this the chief burst out laughing, for he could see how the ministers were disturbed with these Scriptural truths. Each minister was allowed to speak but once. However, the paramount chief invited the brother to repeat his talk again at the end so that all could remember the fine Scriptural counsel. Well over two hundred ministers were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two families of one isolated European group live ninety-five miles apart, with poor road conditions, yet the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and the bimonthly service meeting and school can count on 100 percent attendance. One brother runs a dry-cleaning business, another travels extensively, and four are government officers. In the sparsely populated territory the brothers are well known and this has meant faithfulness and perseverance when re-covering the territory. One sister who had the door of one home slammed in her face a couple of times called a third time, to be greeted with, “I was praying for someone to call.” Now a home Bible study is held regularly at her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 30,586,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,111 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,440</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Spanish government is still vacillating in regard to the decision as to whether full religious freedom should be extended to non-Roman Catholic religions. Information has been given out that they are waiting until the Ecumenical Council decides how much religious freedom there will be. In the meantime Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain follow the command of Christ Jesus to go and disciple all nations. Jehovah God allows the sun to shine upon the just and the unjust. He lets the rain fall upon the righteous and the unrighteous. He gave us the truth as set forth in his Word for all kinds of men. Christians cannot wait until the Vatican Council decides whether the sun will rise or the rain will fall or the light of truth shall shine in all the world, including Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is much opposition in Spain to the preaching of the good news contained in the Bible, but Jehovah’s witnesses are not shrinking back. They are not fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. More than twenty-five Christian ministers have been fined and imprisoned during the past service year because of obeying Jesus’ command to make disciples of people of all nations, including Spain. Even the Supreme Court of Spain handed down two decisions in which they ruled that the exposition of the beliefs of one of Jehovah’s witnesses to friends or strangers is a violation of Spanish law. That may be true, but the Supreme Court of Spain is not sitting as the judge of God’s law. It sounds like the Sanhedrin of ancient times speaking. The record in the Bible says: “With that they called them and charged them, nowhere to make any utterance or to teach upon the basis of the name of Jesus. But in reply Peter and John said to them: ‘Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves. But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.’” (Acts 4:18-20) So Jehovah’s witnesses continue to preach to thousands, and they enjoyed a 17-percent increase of new ministers declaring the good news on the average each month of the entire 1965 service year. Here are some very interesting experiences sent to us from Spain, Andorra and the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious leaders are usually behind the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they use the secular arm of the State to protect themselves from the Biblepreaching activity. However, sometimes they choose to defend themselves. Such was the case when a young pioneer sister called at the home of a person with whom she conducts a Bible study and found two Catholic priests awaiting her. They had been trying to discourage the householder from continuing the Bible study by speaking against Jehovah’s witnesses. However, the pioneer sister was able to defend herself successfully during the long conversation that ensued, so an appointment was made for the following week. When the young sister arrived alone, she was surprised to find, not only two priests awaiting her, but many devout Catholics who were participating in a religious exercise of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cursillos.</span><span class="font5"> These men, whose total number reached twenty-one, were to serve as a sort of court to pass judgment on the defense of the sister before the two priests. Several times one of the priests admitted that the sister’s reasoning was sound, which caused a dispute among the two priests, while all the “jury” listened. Finally, one of the priests threatened to have the sister arrested. He was shown from the Bible that this was the same tactic used by the false religious leaders in the days of the apostles, and that she had already been arrested twice and had spent thirty days in jail for preaching the Bible. In spite of having been raised a Catholic and having a priest in the family, she had been taught nothing about the Bible until coming into contact with Jehovah’s witnesses, for, more often than not, Catholic religious leaders in Spain discourage and prohibit the use of the Bible. This charge was vociferously opposed by the priest. So the sister opened her Catholic Nacar-Colunga Bible, and, in the preface, read to him Cardinal Cicognani’s words that the church at one time not only limited, but actually prohibited the reading of the Bible by Catholics in their own tongues. The priest was obviously embarrassed before his “jury,” and all in attendance were amazed at how this young woman was able to face up to the priest with such calmness. When the discussion finally ended, one of the men present remarked: “Senorita, you have much faith.” The family with whom the Bible study was conducted was pleased at the outcome, and declared that from now on they will use the time previously spent attending Babylonish religious services for home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another city a special pioneer placed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book with an interested lady and made arrangements to bring her the latest copies of the Society’s magazines. Later, the householder received the visit of two nuns. “Is it true that you were visited by a humble woman who spoke very kindly to you about good things?” they asked. Upon receiving an affirmative reply, the nuns warned that she had fallen into a deceiving trap, and that the householder was committing a mortal sin by giving a hearing ear. “You must turn all the literature over to us for destruction, you must slam the door when this woman calls without listening to one more word, and you must confess everything to the priest, and all will be forgiven,” demanded the nuns. Obediently, the woman turned her Bible literature over to them. But when the pioneer called back, the householder’s common decency would not let her slam the door, so a three-hour discussion followed. The woman was pleased with the points considered, and now wanted a confrontation between the Witness and the priest and nuns. It was explained that Jehovah’s witnesses do not participate in debates, but that they are always willing to share good things with their neighbors in fulfillment of the second greatest commandment as pronounced by Jesus. The householder enthusiastically invited first the nuns, then their “mother superior,” and finally the priest, but one and all refused to confront themselves with the ‘humble woman who spoke very kindly about good things.’ Now it was possible to discern who were the real wolves in sheep’s clothing, and the woman is now taking in accurate Bible knowledge by means of a study with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one contacts a married woman with interest, how important it is to make every endeavor to include her husband in the Bible study. In 1957 a married woman in Algiers started to study the Bible. She did not know how to explain what she was studying to her husband, so he opposed her, and later the study was discontinued. In 1961 the family moved to France, where once again the wife came into contact with Jehovah’s witnesses, but explained that she could only study secretly due to her husband’s opposition. Still later, the family moved to Spain. Upon establishing contact with the Witnesses, the woman, because of fear, again tried to avoid having her husband meet them. “But your husband is the first one that should know that you study,” declared the Witness. After an hour’s consideration of the Bible hope, the husband exclaimed: “How is it that you have been hiding these marvelous things from me for so long?” The husband progressed in his Bible study with such rapidity that he was baptized before his wife, and now both are happy, dedicated publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Nestled in the picturesque mountain valleys of the eastern Pyrenees, Andorra is termed the “world’s fifth-smallest nation.” However, living away from “big city life” in the heart of natural beauty does not necessarily serve as a protection against the corroding inroads of materialism. Many Andorrans find themselves so busy with secular pursuits that they have no time to listen to the Kingdom message, and long hours of secular work in the evening impede others from attending the regular Bible study meetings. Yet there are those who realize that “even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” Ministers who speak Catalan, Andorra’s official language, continue to seek out such persons who are conscious of their spiritual need, and were pleased when sixteen were on hand to commemorate the Memorial of the Lord’s death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Brothers in the Canary Islands have rejoiced in a period of spiritual prosperity during the past year during which the Bible educational work has continued to progress, unhindered by a single arrest or fine. True Christians do not try to make martyrs of themselves, but, rather, they endeavor to “go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness,” in order “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” Among the “all sorts of men” mentioned are included a number of sailors who frequent the various ports in the islands. While traveling to a neighboring island, a pioneer looked for an opportunity to give a witness to members of the crew. One manifested interest, and arrangements were made for a Bible study each time he would visit the port. In time the interest of other crewmen was aroused, and studies were started with them also. Next, several of the sailors gave the pioneer the addresses of their families in order that they be visited, and some of these also began to study the Bible. Then a sailor from another ship attended one of the studies, and invited the pioneer to visit his ship also. There he spoke to thirteen crew members, and three of these indicated that they desired to study God’s Word each time their ship visited the port, which is twice a week. The word has continued to spread, and now the pioneer conducts Bible studies with crewmen who work on four different vessels that travel between the islands. How important it is to seek out opportunities to give an incidental witness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even religious leaders sometimes respond to the call to get out of Babylonish religion, even as “a great crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith,” in the days of the apostles. A letter was received from a person asking for literature, and who added that “all my life I have been searching for the truth.” How surprised the brothers were to find that the truth seeker was a village priest on one of the islands! An interview was arranged, and the priest explained that he had realized for a long time that he was teaching foolish things as doctrines, but that he had been unable to find anything better and thus continued as a priest. He was originally impressed with the depth of knowledge contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles dealing with the resurrection, which had come into his possession, and now he is studiously examining the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Surinam have problems just as their brothers and sisters everywhere else do. The branch servant writes that there are many divided homes and many homes where there is no father. Even where there is a complete family unit there is not the theocratic activity within the family that one could normally expect. Meals are not always shared together, nor do families do things together. As in so many other countries so in Surinam there is a crop of juvenile delinquents, many of whom formerly were zealous publishers of the Kingdom. The branch servant writes: “We firmly believe that when the family unit improves, Jehovah will hold true to his promise and we can prevent many of our children from becoming prodigal sons.” That is an interesting observation that all of us can think about. It is something that they are working on in Surinam. Here are a few experiences that the branch servant sends in in regard to the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What does it take to reach the goal for subscriptions during the campaigns each year? Endurance in following up subscription promises. One special pioneer writes: “For the first time I have been able to obtain thirty subscriptions. I have noticed that the reason for my success has been in writing down all subscription promises and following these up faithfully. Endurance was often necessary. On the average, I had to return twice in order to get the subscription. At one place I had to call back for more than two months before the man paid for his subscription. After this man noticed that I patiently called back each time he told me to return, he finally subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and promised to take </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> too.” Do you call back on all subscription promises?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you view your weekends as fine opportunities to worship Jehovah? Five of our Bush Negroes living in isolated territory are using their weekends to praise Jehovah. Last December they reported 177 hours and 48 Bible studies. When we asked them how they managed to spend so much time in the preaching work, one of them gave the following humble answer: “As you know, brother, we live on the river and near us there are no people to talk to. So every Saturday morning our whole family gets into the boat and we paddle for two hours to the next village. There are sixteen Indians living there and six are interested in the truth. We conduct two studies there. As soon as we arrive we start studying, and after dinner we continue our studies. After supper we complete our study for the day. After staying overnight we resume our studies the following Sunday morning and throughout that whole day. As a result, we conducted forty-eight Bible studies.” We had to explain to him that he actually conducted only two Bible studies. Although these brothers are isolated, they are very zealous preachers, using every weekend to praise Jehovah. Can you increase your praise by using your weekends?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Sweden appreciated very much the opportunity of going to Finland to attend the assembly in June of 1965. They had a delightful time and were especially pleased with the way that the Finnish brothers organized the convention and cafeteria. The Society has its own printing plant in Sweden, a fine one, where the Swedish and Norwegian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines are printed. The work in Sweden has moved ahead very well, especially in relation to the distribution of these magazines. This increased their printing production. They were able to put their enlarged Bethel home to good service. The branch servant sends some interesting experiences in as to what has been taking place in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several fine experiences have been told that show how blessed results will come when the Society’s counsel is followed. For instance, on witnessing to relatives a brother relates: “An uncle called at our house and we took the opportunity to speak to him about the truth, which in time led to a Bible study. He subscribed for the magazines, began coming to meetings and it was not long before he himself was witnessing to his children and other relatives. Now he is baptized and an encouragement to all the congregation. Last Christmas he visited us, partly to get away from Christmas festivities, partly to escape birthday celebrations—on his own eightieth birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not to bypass doors because of prejudice is fine advice that was confirmed by a sister when working with the circuit servant. She said: “We never bother with this door; the people there object so much to our work that there is no need to try.” The circuit servant stressed the importance of making the call anyway and seeing what would happen. To their surprise the housewife invited them into a room where her husband was sitting, and they both listened with interest to the sermon and subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Our study method was also demonstrated by means of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font5"> booklet and a study got started right away. What had changed their attitude? The night before they had seen the Society’s film! Another time a circuit servant’s wife went with a sister who said at one door: “It is no use, she never takes anything.” “But I have spoken to this lady over the telephone when we were doing rooming work, so let us try.” They offered the lady the subscription, which she took, saying: “Sure, I can do that. But, turning to the local sister, why have you never asked me to subscribe? I would have done it if you had asked me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ignorance of the clergy was brought very clearly before the public during a series of programs over the TV called “What Does the Church Say?” This has come as a blow to many honest people who used to think that the clergy really had the facts. Several people are still speaking of the half-hour interview on TV where two of Jehovah’s witnesses were questioned a little more than a year ago, as a distinct contrast to the priests’ inability to reply. One keeper of a barbershop, for instance, has kept talking to all about it and stated that that interview was the best thing he had seen or heard in his life: “They really knew how to answer every question that was put to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,825,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The big event in Switzerland this past year was the fine assembly arranged in Basel, a city in the northwest corner of the country. This assembly contributed greatly to making the name of Jehovah known throughout all of Switzerland. Practically all the newspapers published reports on the convention, and the authorities and many businessmen came to know Jehovah’s witnesses much better. Good work was accomplished among many of the foreigners who have come to Switzerland to work, mainly the Italians who had come there to get higher wages than they can earn in Italy. The good news of God’s kingdom was preached to them with good success. Of the seven new congregations established during the service year, five were formed from the “guest workers” speaking the Italian tongue. They have made rapid progress and, being unhindered by relatives and the Catholic influence of Italy and being given good attention by Italian-speaking publishers in Switzerland, they gain maturity quite rapidly. The organization is happy because of the progress that has been made during the year. Here are some interesting experiences from Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother was invited by a former friend to be godfather at the baptism of their baby of five months. The brother declined the invitation and explained his reasons for so doing. Child baptism is not in accordance with Bible teaching; God’s Word bade only adults to be baptized, just as Jesus, for instance, was baptized at the age of thirty years, and in no case whatever would he want to be present at the ceremony of a cult carried out by a servant of a false religion. The young couple asked for further information and invited the brother to their home the following Sunday. On this occasion full proofs could be given on the Bible teaching of baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days later the mother of the young man, who is Catholic, came to visit the young people. She wanted to know when they were going to have that boy baptized; did they not realize that, if the child died, it would not be saved, hence the parents bore a very-grave responsibility? The young couple were not disturbed in the least and gave her the answer on baptism as they had learned it from the Bible, The young man explained to his mother during the discussion: “When I was three weeks old, you had me baptized a Catholic without any consideration of my opinion. It is much too serious a matter for someone to take the responsibility upon himself for another. When my son grows up, he will decide whether he will be Protestant, Catholic or one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A home Bible study was started with this young couple. A little later the young wife asked for the information on baptism again. She wanted to explain this to her parents, who are Protestants, because they had also asked about the child’s baptism. Two weeks later the young couple attended the Memorial service, bringing the wife’s father with them. They there declared their desire to have nothing more to do with false religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many publishers are shy of preaching where they are known, but what joy they often have when they can overcome this timidity! A sister lived in a small village. Everyone knew her and they often observed how she went to preach from house to house in the neighboring villages. At last she began to reproach herself that she had not preached the message of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom to the people in her immediate</span><span class="font5"> vicinity. One day she plucked up courage, overcame her timidity and went from house to house in her own village. And how happy she was that she had at last made this decision! The people in the village were friendly to her and many invited her into their homes. The sister had the impression that they had been waiting a long time for her to visit them too with the message of the Kingdom. She placed seventy-seven magazines that day and has made many good back-calls since.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The two German publishers who came here to serve where the need is great had to leave the country again. Nevertheless, good progress was made and a peak of eleven publishers reached. The publishers have grown spiritually and manifest much joy in feeding the Lord’s “other sheep.” The people of Liechtenstein are friendly and willing to learn more about the Bible, but they must show real courage to hold their own in the face of neighbors and acquaintances, who generally despise them when they observe that they are being taught by Jehovah’s witnesses. But the joy of the truth and the hope radiating from God’s Word imbues more and more people in this country with fearlessness, and the truth makes them free for Jehovah’s pure worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">For a number of years Taiwan moved ahead very rapidly, with increases in Kingdom publishers. Then it began to decline for some time. This was because some who were in the truth were following a man rather than becoming mature in the knowledge of God’s Word and the teachings of the Bible with regard to Christian living. This is the fourth year of decline, but the number of publishers, on the average, seems to have stabilized well at about 1,068. We are now working more with the Chinese people. The missionaries that the Society has sent there have learned the language and they are really able to accomplish much. The missionaries are now working among the Chinese on the west coast of Taiwan. For the many years they worked there, there was very little increase; however, fruitage is finally beginning to show, as more and more Chinese-speaking persons are taking to the truth and are beginning to understand what it is all about. Quite a few have recently engaged in the ministry, and here are some reports from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How happy we all were when Brother Knorr visited us here last December and over </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> hundred attended his lecture on the resurrection! This was in an area where the missionaries have been working longest. His announcement later that arrangements were being made for a special group to be trained in Chinese in the next class of Gilead was a thrill to us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a recent circuit assembly the “Everlasting Good News” film was shown. In attendance was the prison governor, who previously had studied part of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> booklet. On seeing the film, he asked the circuit servant if it would be possible to show the film at the prison. Two weeks later arrangements were completed for six showings in all. A total of 1,235 prisoners attended, but, as many had no previous contact with Christianity, there were mixed opinions about the film. However, they all learned that God’s name is Jehovah and that Babylon the Great is soon to be destroyed. They enjoyed the around-the-world assembly scenes, especially of Brother Franz rubbing noses with the Maori sisters. One of the prisoners asked how he could pray, as he could not imagine God as a trinity and the film had warned against repetitious prayers. I showed him the Bible truth about Jehovah and Jesus and also the model prayer. Other men were talking of “Brother” Knorr and “Brother” Franz and some said they had seen the film three times. Later the governor asked for help in the work of socially rehabilitating the men, so the next week my wife and I returned to conduct a Bible class for all those interested. There were sixty-five women prisoners in my wife’s class and seventy-six men in mine. When I asked the question, “What is God’s name?” all answered “Jehovah!” The governor has resumed his own personal study, with his wife in attendance, and he also intends to arrange an evening study for his staff, to be held after the prisoners retire. The “Everlasting Good News” film certainly impressed him favorably, and he says it is his desire that many of the prisoners become Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in the four countries under the jurisdiction of the Bangkok branch office, namely, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, have been sowing much seed during the past year. The planting goes on and thousands upon thousands of hours are spent preaching, but what the increase will be depends wholly on Jehovah God because it is he who adds to his organization according to his purpose. It takes much patience and endurance on the part of the planter of the seed. The publishers of the Kingdom can plant and water the seeds, and this our brothers in southeast Asia are doing. As all of us know, this part of the earth is under heavy tension and most people are preoccupied with the anxieties of the day. But the <a name="bookmark112"></a><a name="bookmark113"></a>good news is being declared, and here are some interesting experiences that have come in from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During Brother Knorr’s most welcome visit to Bangkok early in the service year, some changes with regard to the Thai </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> were discussed, the implementation of which greatly contributed to the almost 50 percent more new subscriptions taken and the 25 percent more single issues placed than during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, up in Chiengmai, one of our first Thai publishers died. He had been formerly a government official, then he worked at the mission hospital and he was the headmaster at the Presbyterian seminary when the truth reached him early during World War II. Due to his background many people knew him, and according to local custom they came to the Kingdom Hall, where the body was kept, to pay their respects. The brothers used this occasion to give several Bible talks daily until it was time for the funeral. Several hundred listened to the talk given at the hall and then to another at the grave site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Handbills play their part in sowing seed. When a circuit servant advertised a talk in a small village while visiting an isolated publisher, a young man readily accepted the handbill but apologized for not being able to attend the talk as he, too, was going to preach. His interest stirred after reading the back of the handbill advertising the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”;</span><span class="font5"> he wrote to the branch office asking how he could get a copy. The circuit servant who was again in the area was advised to make a call, and two hours were spent discussing the name “Jehovah” and various Bible teachings. He expressed much concern over three nominal Christian groups in his village who refused to join in Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the following visit a study in the chapter “What Is Man?” opened his eyes to see that many so-called “Christian” doctrines are unscriptural. Three hours of study and discussion were all too short for him. He wrote to the Society again, expressing his appreciation for the visit of its representative, expressing his regret that the time spent together was only too short. He mentioned, too, that they are a small group who meet for Bible study and that they do not belong to any organization. The Branch then wrote him about the approaching district assembly and invited him to attend to see Jehovah’s witnesses in action. He came, joined in the assembly work and went also from house to house, “to see how it is done.” Before departing for home he came to see the district servant and said, “Please send us someone to teach us regularly,” and he offered accommodation for a pioneer in his house. Arrangements are now under way to send a couple of special pioneers to help them. It appears that some good interest is developing there, and it all started with a handbill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the close of May 1965, the immigration authorities did not renew the visas for the two missionaries, and so they had to leave the country. However, it is evident that Jehovah is able to keep the work open as long as such is his will, as the following experience illustrates. In 1961 the Ministry of Cults wrote a letter that stated that we could only hold our religious meetings. This letter forbade us to carry on our preaching work publicly; and if the police had known about it, they would have stopped our preaching then and there, as they daily surveyed the missionaries. However, for some unknown reason the carbon copies of this letter never reached the police. They only received a later letter from the Ministry of Cults that said we could carry on our mission as outlined in the previous letter. This continued for four years, until April 1965, at which time the error was discovered; but then they had already decided to put us out and all other missionary groups as well. This four-year period gave us time to reach many people with the everlasting good news and to light a spark of interest in this country where so little is known about Jehovah’s promises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A few years ago a Bible study was begun with three girls of high-school age whose families worship their ancestors. Their race also has the custom of eating various dishes prepared with blood. Through the weekly Bible study the truth was explained to them gradually, step by step. Each objection was overcome. When they learned what the Bible says regarding the sanctity of blood, their reaction was, “How pure the laws of God are!” And from then on they avoided the offensive delicacies at mealtime. After they understood why ancestor worship is wrong, they began refusing to bow down to the ancestral tablet even when their parents tried to force them. When meetings were explained, they began to attend. They were invited to come in service and they came. Now all three conduct Bible studies of their own, two of them with their younger brothers and sisters, and two of the girls have inquired about baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eight years ago a woman of aristocratic background was contacted in the magazine work. She showed little interest and her savage dogs saw to it that the brothers could not easily get back to visit her again. Later she studied with a sister for a while but then stopped again. Three years ago she began to study again in earnest. It seems that her situation in life had changed and with it had come a change of heart. She read the Bible four times and studied very diligently. This meant many important friends had to be given up because of their bad associations, but then she progressed even quicker. By the time she had been in the house-to-house work for a couple of months most of the important government officials had been witnessed to, including the prime minister. All being her friends, she was able to place books with all of them. As a result, Jehovah’s witnesses have been treated very kindly by the Lao government. It soon became apparent that this woman had made a dedication, and she was baptized at the district assembly in Pitsanuloke, Thailand, having already produced fruitage in the Bible study activity, one of her students being with her at the assembly. Patience in calling on her certainly produced blessings so that, when some changes came in this woman’s life, she was eager to serve Jehovah and she remembered the brothers that had called so faithfully over the years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In January one family moved out of Saigon to a city about two hundred miles north of Saigon. The mother and the two oldest children are publishers, and we all wondered how they would do alone in a city characterized by fierce hatred between Catholics and Buddhists. But the spirit of Jehovah has certainly been manifest upon this sister and her children and, happily, they have exceeded our expectations. They have a regular schedule for service, the sister going out three times a week, once with each of the two oldest children, and once alone. She usually stays out three hours or more at a time, even though she has a husband and six children, in all, to care for. But by good organization she manages to carry her responsibilities well. Within her first few weeks in the new city she started a study with a Buddhist man. Now he is convinced that there is a Creator, Jehovah, and he has now his own copy of the Vietnamese Bible. Although the sister understands only the Vietnamese language, in which there are only three booklets and three tracts, she listens and absorbs all that she hears about the truth and marks her Bible well. Her love for Jehovah and his Word is so fervent that she readily absorbs all the deep things of Daniel and Revelation that are explained to her. Her interest is very keen and she handles the Bible and the people like an expert. Each week the Saigon congregation sends her a translation of the questions and answers from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">study, and she studies these with her children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three years ago a Seventh-day Adventist woman was contacted in magazine work and a study was started. Now she is thoroughly convinced of the truth and she and three of her children are sharing in the field service. In the last year they discussed the matter of the sabbath several times with the husband and father, who is an outstanding Adventist preacher, and he has been found without answers or Scriptural support. The Adventist church has refused to assign him to Saigon, because his family is a “bad example.” So he must minister in the highlands. The Adventists have tried valiantly to regain her, but she is now firm in her determination to serve Jehovah. She told them that she never had an interest in the Bible until she learned the truth, that in the Adventist church the Bible never made sense to her. Even the head of the Adventist church in Vietnam called on her. He read her one scripture about loving Christ. She replied that she loved Christ and went to get her Bible. But he closed the Bible and said he had to go. Another person asked her if she had been to the church to get free packages of food that were being passed out. She replied that no money or material things could buy her away from the worship of Jehovah the true God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The service year started off slowly in the territory under the branch office in Trinidad, but as the months moved by and the brothers kept on with their fine work, quite a few symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. On most of the islands under the jurisdiction of the office in Trinidad, a greater witness was given during the year than during the previous year because more time was spent in the field service declaring the good news.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Experiences come in from Trinidad, Barbados, Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The most thrilling part of the year’s activity was the great increase in vacation pioneering for the special activity in April. Up until then the vacation pioneers had been behind last year most of the months. Then came April. It early became apparent that last year’s twenty-eight would be left far behind. It was most gratifying to count 160 by the end of April! The work done by these vacation pioneers brought new peaks in several features of the ministry and made a large contribution to the total work accomplished during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many fine experiences were had by the brothers, especially in connection with the special activity in April. One publisher found how to meet her magazine goal in the following way: “One week had already gone in the course of my two weeks as a vacation pioneer when I realized that I had to step up my magazine placements if I were to reach my goal. But how could I make it really fast? Then it occurred to me—my office! There were many staunch churchgoers working in it. The article in the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> ‘Do You Appreciate What Jesus Did for You?’ would appeal to these folks at ‘Easter.’ I made a list of names and neat little parcels of two magazines each. En route to a back-call the following day I went into the office. Do you know the result? I placed twenty-five magazines!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not just full-time publishers enjoyed the special work in April and had enjoyable results; congregation publishers did too. One brother was concerned about how to get subscriptions during the month of increased activity. He was a foreman of a group of men and made a practice of discussing articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> during lunch hour with the men, stressing the need to get out of Babylon the Great. The men found that the discussions helped them with some of their own problems. When the brother offered the magazine subscription to them he got seventeen subscriptions in one day! For the entire subscription campaign he obtained twenty subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problem of getting time for theocratic activities must be faced by all, including students. Here is a brief schedule of one student who has met the problem successfully. “On days when I have much homework and have to attend meetings, I leave school at three o’clock and go to the library nearby, where I do my schoolwork until it is time to leave for the Kingdom Hall. After the meeting I go home to complete any problem I could not solve before. On Saturday mornings I help my mother with the housework, do whatever schoolwork I have to do and prepare for magazine activity that evening. On Sunday afternoon I conduct a Bible study and attend the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. In this way I find no difficulty in caring for my schoolwork and my service to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is most important promptly to follow up interested persons who move. A woman had been studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and other groups. Pressure was becoming heavy from her husband’s clergyman and her family so that uncertainty prevailed in her mind. Suddenly her husband was transferred and this relieved her of the pressure. She did not contact any religious groups, but prayed to be shown God’s will. She felt the right group would be the one to find her for themselves. Would the Witnesses care for their God-given responsibility? One day her phone rang. “This is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Our friends have advised us that you have moved here, so we would be happy to meet you.” Of course, her study was then renewed with confidence, and she is making progress. Also, she witnesses to her family as to each new thing she learns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BARBADOS (W.I.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 783 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 304</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year began with a reorganization of the work in Barbados. The number of congregations was reduced so that there would be larger congregations with more servant material in the Bridgetown area. The two circuits that previously functioned were combined to form one for the entire island. It took a little while for the brothers to get adjusted, but improvement soon became noticeable. Every month saw more publishers than for the previous year. The outstanding work of eighty-six vacation pioneers in April accelerated the work greatly and resulted in many new peaks. At the end of the year the average increase over the previous year was eight percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer wrote of the satisfaction she had in helping someone to embrace the new way of life that Jehovah has given to his people: “In 19611 met a pleasant young woman who accepted literature after hearing my sermon. I called back and started studying our literature with her. I soon realized that, although she had respect for God’s Word, she was not serious about the study. She changed the time and then the day for the study, but I persisted. I had to be away for about a year, but upon returning I diligently sought her out at a new address and revived the study. She still had that carefree but friendly attitude. She was intelligent and would grasp the instruction. Then suddenly she changed. She asked for a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World. Translation</span><span class="font5"> and began taking a keener interest in the study, asking questions and preparing in advance. Soon she was at the meetings regularly and further interest was shown. In the following months she saw the unscripturalness of her way of life. She would confess her situation and I would show her what God’s counsel was. She began making all the changes necessary. I often had to pray with her and for her to give her the strength. She stopped being a chain smoker and corrected other problems in her life. Just two days after she was married she had the privilege of sharing in the ministry from door to door. Now she and her two girls are publishing the Word of life. I was so happy to note that after her dedication she vacation pioneered and now is conducting two Bible studies, thus helping others to take up our new way of life.” Yes, persistent “sowing” and “watering” bring Jehovah’s blessing and growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQITIA (W.I.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 150</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the first time in two years a new peak of publishers was reached, toward the end of the service year. The work continued to progress, with the publishers’ being assisted to maturity by the special pioneer couple. Although this is just an isolated group of publishers, the special pioneer couple decided that they must have a Kingdom Hall. Meeting most of the expense and furnishing much of the labor, they have now sufficiently completed a concrete-block hall in which to hold meetings. It is forty-two feet by twenty-seven feet. When finished, it will have living quarters for the couple and ample meeting space for expansion in the years to come. Publishers from St. Vincent came over and helped by casting the concrete blocks, and some help was also furnished by others in the construction of the hall. This will further advance the Kingdom interests in Bequia. An increase of six percent was enjoyed over last year’s average number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,766</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 294</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of consistently presenting the monthly offer is shown by this special pioneer’s experience: “During the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign I called on a lady who from all appearances was very poor. Nevertheless, I decided to present the subscription, which, to my surprise, she willingly and gladly accepted. Thereupon I started a Bible study and made arrangements to return the following week. The study was continued and has been regularly held since. As her knowledge of the truth grew, her concern for her family in a spiritual way became more acute. On one occasion she inquired: ‘How can I help my mother come to a knowledge of the truth?’ I told her that she had a wonderful opportunity to pass on the things she learned to her aged mother. Thus she began to share in the field service without realizing it. So when I finally invited her out in the door-to-door work, there was no hesitancy on her part to accompany me. At present she is making good progress in both study and service. Think what a blessing I would have lost if I had failed to offer the subscription as instructed by Jehovah’s organization!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GRENADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,034</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 165 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 497</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of interesting experiences have been enjoyed by the brothers in the field service. Some of these were in connection with the April campaign. The vacation pioneer activity was very successful. Publishers who had never thought of sharing the good news in this capacity reached out for this privilege. The result was an all-time high in the total number of vacation pioneers for any one month. It was a source of encouragement to many when an aged publisher, eighty-six years old, did vacation pioneering for two weeks. Even though she did not meet the goal of hours, her determination served to stimulate many of her associates to do similarly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes persons with whom regular studies have been held and who were at the point of engaging in the service migrate to some other country. Publishers who are alert will endeavor to make arrangements for such persons to keep up their studies and attend meetings in the country to which they immigrate. One pioneer did just that and was overjoyed to receive this letter from one who had been away for about a month. “I attend the London S---- Unit. I attended the last</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">circuit assembly where sixteen persons got immersed. For the past weeks there have been some interesting public talks delivered at the Kingdom Hall. I attend all the meetings and the book study. Needless to say, I am enjoying all.” Why not do the same when your students move to another territory either on your own island or elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. LUCIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86,194</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 93 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 927</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the truth is spoken to one who has a good heart and regular studies are held, encouraging changes in that one’s life are made as he applies the truths learned to himself and begins to put on the new personality. After having a home Bible study with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> man for three months, a special pioneer had the joy of being regularly accompanied by the interested one to the meetings. Soon he expressed his desire to accompany the group in the service. He was living in a consensual arrangement and so the pioneer explained the Scriptural requirements for one who wanted to be a preacher of the good news. He was willing to get married, but not his consensual partner, causing him to separate from her and their daughter while still maintaining them. From then on he had a full share in the service. Then his former consensual partner started to attend the meetings and begged him to return to her home. He explained that this could be possible only if they married. Though her mother was opposed, she finally agreed to be married, and he continues to be a zealous publisher. He has been assigned his first student talk in the ministry school and contemplates being baptized at the next circuit assembly. His wife too attends the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you sometimes feel too tired to go out in the service? This publisher did, but prayed to Jehovah for strength and courage to go. Then the publisher went out in magazine street work and engaged a man in conversation. At first the man showed no interest, but on hearing the Witness remark that Jesus did not die on a cross, he wanted proof. An appointment was made to call at his home. He was ready with his Bible when the call was made and was satisfied with the discussion, which centered around Acts 5:30 and 10:39. He took the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, and a study was started with his wife, who is very interested. The publisher concludes, “All of this came about by not being too tired to do magazine work one Saturday night when I only thought I was too tired. What a blessing I might have missed!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. VINCENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 911</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not all who are called on give a friendly response to the message, and yet not all who are even opposed continue their opposition. Some time ago a householder who had had a number of the Society’s publications was contacted. Under the influence and instruction of her priest, however, she destroyed all the literature. When a Witness called some time later, she refused to listen and said she did not want to see the Witness anymore. All subsequent calls met with the same opposition. Some time later a woman who was familiar with the work of the Witnesses was called on and obtained literature. After a few visits she told the Witness about her mother and wanted the Witness to call on her, which the publisher willingly agreed to do. The mother proved to be the opposing woman! Surprisingly, the Witness was received with a warm welcome. The tables had turned; something had brought about a change of heart. She listened attentively to the sermon, and another surprise came when she took the subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> A home Bible study was started and she made good progress. She admitted how foolish she had been to listen to the priest and destroy the literature. Although advanced in age, she determined to dedicate her life to Jehovah and was immersed. Further opposition by religious leaders did not prevent her from getting out of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOBAGO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,333</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 62 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 538</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Studying with relatives of those who are already dedicated Witnesses is a source of increase that should not be overlooked by the brothers. A special pioneer reports: “Two years ago I visited the home of an elderly woman and as I talked to her I noticed a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity</span><span class="font5"> along with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’ </span><span class="font5">booklet on her table. I started to study with her then and there. I learned that her son was a Witness, and this gave me firm conviction that here was one of those who needed to be ‘marked in the forehead.’ The study has continued till now, and this regardless of the ‘contrary talk by sinners.’ She attended our district assembly and attends meetings at our local Kingdom Hall. She began to publish during the special campaign in April.” The pioneer hopes that she will soon dedicate her life to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">URUGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,593,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,256 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,149</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark117"></a>As in other countries Jehovah’s witnesses in Uruguay must take their stand on various issues such as those involving blood, patriotic exercises and nationalism. The worsening economic conditions have caused some to pay more attention to materialism. However, Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate and understand the reasons for these increased problems, and the majority of them are demonstrating maturity and firmness when faced with these problems. The work has gone along very well during the past year, and for the first time they have passed the half-million mark in hours spent in Kingdom service. Here are some of the experiences that the brothers enjoyed as reported by the Branch in Uruguay. There is also a report on the Falkland Islands.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we were able to open the work in several isolated towns, making the Kingdom message available to some 70,000 more persons. Special pioneers have been sent to some, while a special arrangement to help with weekly traveling expenses has enabled others to work regularly in nearby towns that are too small for a special pioneer assignment and too far to be worked by a congregation. In one such town of 1,300 population, two special pioneers have worked two days weekly. Within two months they succeeded in reactivating three persons who now reach all the goals of a congregation publisher; twelve studies are now conducted, and thirty-six attend meetings in their little Kingdom Hall. The clergy, normally inactive, suddenly became alive and began to slander the witness work. Nevertheless, the circuit servant’s recent visit drew fifty-five for his public talk, and prospects for further growth are excellent. A man and woman living together for fifteen years without being married have decided to legalize their marriage, and another immoral person has cleaned up his life to associate with this little isolated group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young girl from the country gave her name to a friend in the city and said she wanted to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses. A special pioneer sister came into possession of the name and address and wrote the girl, sending booklets and magazines, and began a study through the mail, although she never met the girl. The study made good progress. You can imagine how anxious they were to meet each other. One day the girl made a special trip to visit the pioneer sister, and how happy they were to have personal association and a Bible study together! Next the pioneer sister visited the girl and took her out in the service for three hours. The girl has continued to study and to speak the truth with her neighbors and friends, even though she has had to study by means of correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes it is necessary to speak very plainly to new ones about their responsibilities, so as to leave no doubts in their minds. One study dragged on over a long period without much progress until it was turned over to a special pioneer brother. He soon observed that this man lived beyond his means and made his living by smuggling. The pioneer confronted him squarely with these issues and explained that Christians must pay “Caesar” what belongs to him and must obey God’s will. As a result, the man made the necessary changes in his life, progressed in knowledge and began to preach in April, helping us reach the 20-percent increase in the congregation. He got baptized at the next circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FALKLAND ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 300</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Practically everyone there knows everyone else. Some families have been there a long time and have intermarried, so many of the inhabitants are related and are personally acquainted with the private affairs of one another. Thus it takes much courage and determination to break away from the traditional way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On July 19 two brothers embarked from Montevideo to work the colony for two months, and they were able to give personal assistance to a few persons who had studied and preached a little when the missionaries visited the islands in past years. It is hoped that they will become stronger and be able to continue after these two missionaries leave. Prospects would be good for forming a small congregation if about two families of mature publishers would move to and work in the islands and take the lead in forming the nucleus of such a congregation, being willing and able to make the sacrifice necessary to go and work where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VENEZUELA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,722,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,219 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,067</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers of the good news of the Kingdom in Venezuela are not rich in material things, but they are rich in fine works, and during the past year they have shared generously in spreading the Word of truth to others. Because of doing this and starting many home Bible studies they were able to aid 386 persons to the point of baptism, and this year they enjoyed a 13-percent increase in the average number of publishers sharing in Kingdom service. There is still a lot of work to be done in Venezuela, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they will keep at the work until it is done. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One pioneer sister, while out sharing the good news with others, placed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> with a woman who showed interest in the message. She then relates: “On the back-call I placed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font5"> booklet. I started a study with her and she told me that her neighbor showed interest in the study. I encouraged her to invite this woman, and the following week she attended and showed a desire to take part in the study, which by this time was in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> book. The first woman has two teen-age girls and the other has four daughters who at first held back from studying because they thought we were Protestants, but after this barrier was overcome they showed their willingness to study. I found out that neither of the women knew how to write, so I used the Society’s booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Learn to Read and Write </span><span class="font5">to help them learn, and, because of a sincere desire to serve Jehovah, one of the women now fills out her field service report and takes part in the written reviews. Also, I learned that both women were living in a consensual arrangement but were determined to straighten up their lives. One of the women has separated from the man she lived with for seven years. It has not been easy for her as she is not too well physically and is very poor. She gets up at three a.m., cooks on a kerosene stove to prepare food for factory workers, and in this way she provides for herself and her children. An additional joy was when, after the study, one of them asked me, 'Since we have decided to stop celebrating Christmas, what shall we do with our decorations?’ Before I could say anything, the other woman answered: ‘Well, I’ll tell you what I did with mine. I took all my religious symbols and dumped them out.’ It has been my joy seeing five persons out of the two families begin to publish. This shows the power of God’s Word when applied and practiced.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another sister told this experience at a circuit assembly: “One afternoon while working in the magazine work I placed two magazines with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> young man working in a restaurant, but no arrangements were made for a back-call, as he was busy with his clients. About two months later, while working in the service, I met this same young man at a door; he recognized the magazines and said he liked them very much. As he showed interest I explained the purpose of our work and asked him if he had a Bible. He said No, but he would like to have one, and so arrangements were made to return with one and start a study. After a few back-calls a study was started in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font5"> Sometimes when I went for the study, the father of the young man, who lived in another city, was present. Although he did not show interest, he did not interfere with the study. After seeing the father several times but never the mother, I asked the boy about his mother, and he told me the following story: His parents had been separated for four years due to marriage disagreements, and he had come from Spain to Venezuela to try to unite them again. A priest had written him a letter saying that, according to his opinion, the son could unite the parents. After he came to Venezuela he did not find the solution to the problem, although he counted on the priest to help him. He had abandoned all plans to bring his father and mother together and lost contact with his mother, even though she lived in the same city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Knowing the power of the Bible and the positive results when other methods fail, I asked the young man why he did not visit his mother and talk about the message of truth in the Scriptures. I told him of similar experiences and how the Bible had solved them; also, that only the Bible and a knowledge of it could make a change in the hearts of his parents and bring about the desired results. He decided to go see his mother and put into practice the Bible counsel. The Bible had positive results from the beginning, but in an indirect way, due to the change in the personality of the boy. The mother noted this change in her son and she liked very much the way the boy acted now. Due to this she was ready to listen to the counsel of the son based on what he had learned from the Scriptures. So by witnessing to his mother and to his father when he came to visit, the boy was able to unite the parents again. The boy began to live with his parents and to have a Bible study with them. By this time the young man had progressed rapidly in the truth, had been baptized and had started to pioneer. The parents began to put on a new personality; they attended meetings regularly and began to go in the service. At a circuit assembly the parents were also baptized. They have dedicated their lives to the Creator of marriage and love and give thanks to Jehovah and his organization for uniting their family in true love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past service year Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia have made very fine progress. They enjoyed a 7-percent increase in the number of publishers associated with the congregations, and they also enjoy freedom to assemble together in the house of their God and to study the Bible. Many more people are assembling in the congregations at Memorial time, and more people are reading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> which is printed in Yugoslavia in the Croatian, Slovenian and Serbian languages. All of this means that good progress was made in the preaching of the good news. Here are a few experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the town of T---- there lives a sister, an elderly</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">widow. She does knitting to make a living and sells it at the market. She had no apartment of her own, but was merely a tenant. Being a zealous publisher of the Kingdom message, she had to move out of her room many times, because the people did not want to have a tenant “who makes propaganda for a new faith.” Through her zealous preaching she found a number of interested persons. Finally, she could not find a room at all in that place and was forced to move to another town, where she was taken in by a brother. But twice a month she returned to the market in T---- and at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the same time she took care of the interested persons there. Her earnest prayer to Jehovah was to help her find a way so that she could take better care of those interested persons in T--- and study with them. A</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">month later when she was again at the market in T---, she was told that a man was ready to sell his</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">house there. It was an old house, however, and in very poor condition. The sister had only half of the money needed to buy the house. But while she was conducting a study, another interested woman came in and said that a woman, also interested in the truth, was willing to loan her the money needed. So the sister bought the house. Brothers from a nearby congregation now came every Sunday to T---and renovated the house, bring</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing materials and money, so that the house came to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">look as good as new. The largest room was turned into a Kingdom Hall. When everything was finished and the chairs were bought, the sister told the circuit servant that now he could report a new congregation, the congregation of T----! In the meantime all the interested</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">persons got baptized, among them also a man. Public talks in the hall prove to be very beneficial, with more and more persons attending and a good number showing real interest. But happiest of all is the elderly widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ZAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,496,500</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There have been some very tense moments during the past service year while the brothers have been preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Zambia. Cases of intimidation have continued in parts of the country because the brothers refuse to be involved in political matters. They insist on sticking to their assigned duties of preaching the everlasting good news about Jehovah’s kingdom. They are anxious to do this peaceably, but some political agitators continually try to disturb them and want them to join a political party. Of course, those who are interested just in political work are always trying to arouse nationalistic feelings, and they resent it very much when Jehovah’s people persist in obeying God as ruler rather than man. But another year has gone by and a very fine witness has been given from one end of the country to the other. Here are some interesting reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer, sent to isolated territory, was told he could not preach unless he obtained a political party card. Because he refused, attempts were made to intimidate him, a gang of youths being sent for this purpose. The second time this happened the pioneer reported the incidents to the chief, who had the youths arrested. The pioneer, not desiring trouble, asked the chief to forgive them if they promised not to continue their acts of intimidation, and this was done. The leading councilor of the chief was so impressed by this action of the pioneer that he obtained a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book, and later subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The local Constituency Chairman of the political party also subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and has now registered his marriage and hopes to qualify soon as a publisher of the good news of God’s kingdom. Even the local youth organizer of the party began to show interest. Though the special pioneer later left the assignment to take up circuit work, he left behind a group of nine publishers, along with a regular pioneer, organized to preach in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The quality of honesty among Jehovah’s people is often instrumental in directing persons to the truth. A man in charge of a store had manifested an opposed attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses when they tried to preach to him. One day a circuit servant happened to visit the store to purchase a raincoat, and the opposed man by mistake gave the circuit servant too much change. Realizing this, the brother brought this to the man’s attention and returned the additional money. The man was surprised by this demonstration of honesty, and, on finding out he was dealing with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he was moved to say: “This is certainly a witness to me. God has caused this because of your belief.’’ The circuit servant had with him a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> containing the article “Be Honest in Everything,’’ and this was readily placed, as well as three bound books. The man immediately agreed to have a Bible study in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How can a blind brother share in teaching others the truth? One such brother, with no Braille literature available in his language, is accomplishing much by Jehovah’s help and the help of his brothers. He prepares in advance for his Bible study work. Another brother reads the paragraphs that are to be studied in the book, along with the questions. Scriptures are also considered. He goes through the study in the usual way, except that he has his publisher-companion read the question. He remembers the question so well from his preparation that he can now repeat the question word for word if necessary, or break it down with good teaching technique, drawing the householder into the discussion. If, when the paragraphs are being read, the reader makes a slip, he will kindly correct him, telling him exactly what the word is over which he stumbled. He remembers the scriptures cited in the paragraphs and calls for these to be read as required, stating from memory the chapter and verse. About this publisher, a district servant remarked: “His knowledge and especially his interest and desire put some of the more fortunate publishers to shame.” Now this blind brother plans to vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we conclude the service year we are enjoying a very fine series of “Word of Truth” District Assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The concern of the brothers about getting to all the sessions is heartwarming, some traveling on foot for four and five days through sand, with donkeys to carry their supplies, others traveling many miles on bicycles, one special pioneer making over three hundred miles on dirt roads in just over five days. Good attention is shown at the sessions even by the younger children. After a session that included a talk illustrating how to combat demon influences, one little boy was overheard saying to his mother: “Please take these charms off my neck. Didn’t you hear from the platform that it is bad to wear charms?” The mother quickly complied. At these assemblies some donated used clothing was distributed to needy brothers, and this was most appreciated. How such expressions of love draw the brothers into closer unity! Certainly the brothers are most thankful that they can meet together at these assemblies in peace and enjoy the rich spiritual food from Jehovah’s table as well as experience the fine encouragement that comes from, associating with their brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ELEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 103,546 Population: 422,163,000 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,077</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We would very much like to list the activity of the witnesses of Jehovah in the above countries in our chart in the forepart of this book, but we have to group all eleven countries together for the protection of the brothers and sisters who work in these countries. All the governments in these countries know that Jehovah’s witnesses are there. They know they are doing something, but they are not able yet by any reports that the Society publishes to ascertain how many of Jehovah’s witnesses there are in each country. We feel that, if they knew, great pressure would be brought against these fellow servants of ours until they found them all by intensifying their persecution and opposition. However, we are very happy to be able to give experiences from these countries and to tell you a little news about our brothers there. We are certainly delighted that they can continue in this grand work, but it takes real <a name="bookmark118"></a><a name="bookmark119"></a>patience, endurance and the other qualities of the spirit that a Christian must have to be pleasing to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Great difficulties continue to beset the brothers in Albania. It has been impossible for them to send any reports of their Kingdom service activities. Some of the brothers are still in prison, and it is very difficult to have any meetings for worship and Bible study. However, we have learned that the brothers are steadfast in their faith and they are not giving up. They are helping and encouraging one another to be faithful and serve the Creator, Jehovah. The request received from our brothers in Albania is, “Pray to the Lord for us.” This we shall certainly do, with confidence that Jehovah will continue giving strength by his spirit to our faithful brothers and sisters there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The harvest is great, but the workers are few.” (Matt. 9:37) This is especially so in the country of Bulgaria. There are many honest persons who are longing for an answer to the question: What does the future hold for mankind? They do not get the answer in the churches nor in politics, but when such persons come in contact with the truth about God’s kingdom, then they may travel one hundred or more miles to learn more about it, as was the case with interested persons in Bulgaria. The work in Bulgaria has made some progress during the past service year. A number of persons have taken up a diligent study of the Bible and changed their course of life to please the only true God. But whereas people in other Communist countries enjoy somewhat more freedom, this unfortunately is not the case in Bulgaria. There is really no good reason for them to be afraid of Jehovah’s witnesses, because they do not cause harm to anybody nor do they work against the government. They are lawful citizens and seek only the best for their fellowmen. Although the situation there is not easy, Jehovah blesses the efforts of his devoted servants, and thus they see results in spite of all the adverse circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, his witnesses in Czechoslovakia have enjoyed a blessed year of service. The family of faith has grown, and a considerable number of persons have been immersed. It all shows that preaching in unfavorable season also yields fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lost purse won a person for Jehovah’s service, as can be seen when reading the following experience: Some years ago one of Jehovah’s witnesses found a purse in the street. Besides a sum of money it also contained tlie address of its owner, an elderly lady. For the brother it was self-evident that he should return the lost purse to its owner, but to the owner it was rather a big surprise. She said to the brother: “Please give me your address, so that I may visit you one day to thank you properly for your kindness.” The lady then visited the witness of Jehovah the very same day. Her first words were: “I just have to know what kind of a person it is in the world still, who, having found a lost purse, does not keep it for himself, but returns it to the owner.” This, of course, gave the brother an excellent opening to give a witness on the high moral principles of God’s Word, the Bible, and also the Bible’s promise of a new system in which honesty will be the rule of every citizen. This kindled genuine interest in the lady for the message of the Bible. She had many questions, and several years of diligent study in God’s Word followed. Today, as a publisher of God’s Word, she belongs to that honest group of persons who, among other things, return lost purses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The end of the service year brought the “fifteenth anniversary” of the ban on our work in East Germany. But thanks to Jehovah’s protection and blessing the enemy did not succeed in its attempt to silence the Kingdom message. Despite the ban and years of fierce persecution and pressure upon God’s people, many more people have been reached with the good news and have taken their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses, and the endurance of the publishers has been a great witness to Jehovah’s name and an encouragement to their brothers in other countries not to become fearful of those who kill the body, but to continue in their God-given work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two vacation pioneers started talking to a woman in a cemetery. She showed a real desire to learn of the hope for the dead. They arranged a back-call with her. When they called on her, she was already waiting for them. She had read some literature from the Adventists, but thought that Jehovah’s witnesses are closer to the truth. The vacation pioneers identified themselves as being Jehovah’s witnesses, and she exclaimed: “I consider it God’s guidance that I met you in the cemetery.” A Bible study was started and she made rapid progress. When for the fourth time the study was conducted in December, the woman wanted to present the publishers with a gift of an “Advent wreath,” a preChristmas decoration, which she had made herself for them to show her appreciation. The publishers tactfully took up the subject of holidays and images. Even while they were discussing the matter from the Bible, she said that she wanted to do God’s will. She took her Christmas tree, Advent wreath, her religious images and rosary to burn them at once. The study continued to make good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A woman who had been studying with a publisher for some time decided to quit her church membership. When she had done so, she was called on by the minister of her former congregation. He asked her why she had left church. Telling him that he had not been teaching them the full truth, because he had been passing over God’s name, he replied that the name was really not so important. He mentioned that she had not paid all her church tax and maybe that was the true reason why she left. Now the woman took her checkbook, wrote out a check and gave it to him. The clergyman noticed that she had not signed the check and he told her that her name was missing on the check and he could not get any money for it. “If my name is so important,” she replied, “how much more the name of the Creator of heaven and earth.” Of course, she did not sign the check, but continued to witness to him. He admitted that it would be much better for the church if its members had even half the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Often a courageous decision is required to care for the “sheep” and not abandon them to the “wolves.” A young sister had been studying with a woman for about six months, and she had made good progress. The woman had a boy of fourteen years. One day while they had their study the boy came into the room quite excitedly and told them that he just reported the publisher to the police and that they would arrive soon. But now he felt sorry for it, so he told them about it. The publisher left at once through the back door, encouraging the woman while she left, because she was quite upset because of her son. Now, what was the publisher to do about, it? The next day she called again on the woman at a time when her son was at school. She learned that two policemen actually had come. They wanted to know what “spinster” had been calling on her. The woman told them that it was just a friendly old lady. Then they started arguing about Jehovah’s witnesses, saying that there were not only old folks with them, but, in fact, more and more young people were joining them, despite the efforts put forth by the authorities to enlighten the people about the harmfulness of Jehovah’s witnesses, and that even prison terms would not frighten them away. The publisher found that the woman was not at all impressed by what the police had told her. But she was happy that the publisher had called so soon. The study continued, at a time when the boy was at school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being circumspect often helps overcome an obstacle that bars people from learning the truth. A radio mechanic was contacted by a brother making an initial call. He seemed to be quite interested. But surprisingly he did not want to be called on again, obviously because of fear of man. The publisher did not give up, though. He told a sister about this man and she took her old radio set to him for a repair. In that way she had the opportunity to talk to this man several times while checking whether he had got her radio set fixed. Little by little the man became more confident and now enjoys a Bible study with a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the brothers do not have much literature in their own languages, the Society has been making every effort to keep them supplied with the new publications as they come out. The brothers have been very appreciative of the material they have received. As one wrote: “It is a great joy and encouragement to us to hear that many people are going up to the mountain of Jehovah to walk in his paths. One has no words to express fully his depth of feeling and appreciation about Jah’s goodness. Only those who have tasted of him know how it is. In fact, it is truly amazing to observe the way he helps his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the brothers in Eritrea have been under much pressure during the past year to take a loyalty oath that would be a violation of their Christian neutrality. Some of the brothers have even lost their employment over this. However, the brothers recognize that when they are asked to do something that violates the law of God they have no choice but to obey Jehovah’s direction. So this is what the brothers in Eritrea have done when the rulers demanded an expression of total loyalty and have tried to break down the consciences of our brothers. They took the course similar to that expressed by Jesus, who was loyal to Jehovah even to his death. As he stated: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—Matt. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to be able to report that word has just been received that all those who were dismissed from their jobs have now resumed work following an appeal to the government. It was determined that the oath was a violation of consitutional rights, which is a good indication that all Ethiopians are protected by law no matter what their religion is. We give thanks to Jehovah for the outcome of this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, there has also been opposition to the work in Addis Ababa, where several of the Witnesses were arrested and brought into court because of having a Bible study with an interested person. A priest who attended raised the accusation that they were defaming the church because they had shown from the Scriptures what God’s Word truly teaches, and as a result of this they were given various sentences, including imprisonment and fines, despite the guarantees of the country of religious freedom for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A conversation during a train journey proved to be beneficial. A publisher started a conversation with a married couple who traveled in the same compartment with him. When the brother directed the conversation to the Bible, he met with real interest on the part of the couple because they belonged to the Pentecostal church and were on their way to their religious meeting. They then invited the brother to visit them, saying that they had never heard the things he had told them, although they were Bible readers. The brother called on them, well prepared. The couple listened with interest and wanted the brother to come again. On the third visit he introduced the study of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book. After a short while they broke their connections with the Pentecostal church. The man was an elder in that church; so the preacher and others came to see him, urging him not to leave them. But he told them that he and his wife were not willing to alter their decision and that henceforth they would only serve Jehovah and not follow human teachings any longer. Those of the Pentecostal church then replied that it would not have troubled them so much if he and his wife had joined any other church than these unpopular Jehovah’s witnesses. After a study period of only seven months, this couple were determined to get baptized, and now they are zealous publishers of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you get an address to call on a person and witness to him, do you put the slip somewhere in a drawer and forget about the matter? The following experience shows that such persons should be contacted conscientiously: Somewhere a sister had the opportunity of witnessing to a man. Living far away from him, she sent the address to the local congregation. When the call was made on the man, he was very pleased that the sister had kept her promise and had sent someone. The wife of this man was a devout Catholic, leading others in prayer by using the rosary. Nevertheless, she was pleased to meet Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom she had read a lot in the papers recently. She said: “You are being accused today as were Christ and his disciples.” Disproving the slander in the public press, the publishers who made the visit presented the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses, and all this was followed with keen interest by the family. After a few calls the Catholic woman said: “Since you have been visiting us, I am very happy. The truth has brought sunshine and happiness to our home. My husband is no more a slave to excessive drinking, has stopped swearing and makes great efforts to give up smoking. His nerves are much better now. And as for my daughter, I formerly believed she was godless, because she removed the statue of my saint from the apartment. Now she is also ready to study with us. The Catholic religion, which I thought was the best, could not bring about such changes in our lives.” This family then came under attack by neighbors, relatives and the priest, but this has only strengthened them. They already preach the Kingdom message, and all three are eager to be immersed. Yes, a promise kept and a call made on an address received brought about a symbolic resurrection of three persons from the dead condition of this world to true life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A prominent feature of our activity was the preaching work in outlying territories by groups of publishers who went camping during their vacation time. Their camps served as a base from which they went vacation pioneering and covered the whole neighborhood. Many people were reached who had not been preached to for years; some of them even heard the message for the very first time in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another vicinity many people from a nearby town came out for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> walk to see the camp of a group of publishers. When the publishers noticed the interest of the people, they arranged to have their meetings outside in front of their camp. Thus they had the discussion of the daily text, their study meeting, field service demonstrations, ministry school and talks outside, and many people stopped to listen and asked questions at the end. The publishers had clusters of people around them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Generally, it was eleven o’clock at night before the people went home to their town. Even the commanding officer of the police station came out in plain dress and was very friendly, but he wanted to know who was in charge of the camp. That, of course, it seems no one knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How much preaching can be done by a Ione magazine was noticed by a publisher who gave a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine to a fellow worker. While this man was reading at home the article &quot;Christendom Has Failed God!” a high-school teacher and his wife came visiting him.. They obtained the copy from him. From their hands the copy passed into the home of a lawyer, and from there to the wife of a state prosecutor. Finally, the publisher received his copy back from his fellow worker and learned how it had been circulating all the time. The people who read it were so much impressed with the message, that they copied the article to keep it for themselves. The high-school teacher has already asked for further copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers even found a way to share in the Bible campaigns in December and June. Of course, they do not have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> available, but a very fine means for them to contact people is by offering them a copy of the Bible, limited supplies of which they can obtain in local stores. They obtained as many copies as they could get for those two months and, putting forth a special effort, they placed more than thirty thousand copies, many times as many as they had ever placed before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the fact that our brothers in Romania do not have any freedom to preach, they go on faithfully in the work of making disciples. During the past service year the work in Romania has been strengthened and progress has been achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hospital patients often have a very good opportunity to witness. It happened that a brother suffered an accident and was brought to the hospital. Although he faced a serious operation, he was of good courage and was not worried at all. Before he got the anesthetic, he gave a witness to the surgeon, telling him that everlasting life can be received only through faith in Jehovah and through the mediator Jesus Christ. This aroused the interest of the doctor, and he paid this patient a visit every day, desirous of knowing more about the belief of Jehovah’s witnesses. After the brother recovered from his operation and left the hospital, he was invited several times to the doctor’s home. In course of time, the doctor acquired a knowledge of the truth and expressed the desire to get baptized. Today the doctor himself has many opportunities in the hospital to inform patients about the true hope of life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How incidental witnessing can bear fruit is illustrated by the following experience: A brother who is a mason was building a house for a family. During the construction he was asked more than once how the house could be built to withstand earthquakes. The brother used this as an opportunity to show that a storm will come, according to the Bible, when no house will be safe for survival. As time went on he used many good opportunities to show the owner of the building under construction how true safety can be gained. He showed him that each one has to acquire knowledge and faith and dedicate himself to the only true God, whose name is Jehovah. Thus, while building a literal house for this family, he also laid the foundations for a symbolic house and continued to build upon them. As time went on this spiritual building program showed results, in that the owner of the house, his wife and daughter put their faith in God's new order, underwent immersion and are now faithful publishers of God’s Word. Would this have been the case if the brother working on that house as mason had kept back the good news from them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TUBKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much of the work in Turkey is done by making effective use of incidental witnessing. How useful incidental witnessing is and to what fine results it can lead can be seen from the following experience sent in by a sister: “Once, when a lady I study with was not at home, I knocked at the door of her neighbor and asked if she would know where her neighbor had gone. She did not know, but invited me in to rest a little. During our conversation when she mentioned that she had a small girl who is often sick, I used this opportunity and told her that in the near future trouble, sickness and even death will be no more and that the whole earth will be a paradise. I explained that this paradise was different from the one the Koran mentions. When leaving I said that I was glad to have made her acquaintance and offered to visit her again; this she accepted. At the following calls I showed her that some things mentioned in her Koran can be explained only by the Bible. She immediately asked where to find a Bible, and bought one. When this Moslem lady saw the harmonious writing of the Bible and that it includes prophecies, she began to doubt the Koran and Mohammed. After six months of study she started to believe in the Bible because of what she learned about Christ. She spoke to her sister about the truth, who responded favorably too. With both persons a study in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When this lady left her Moslem practices and began to live according to the truth, persecution from her Moslem husband and relatives resulted, but she told them that she would endure it for the sake of Jesus. After she taught her daughter to read and write she started to study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> with her, and the child, while playing, preached to the children of her relatives or, when nobody was around to talk to, to her doll. Even though only five years old, she attends and participates in the meetings, because her mother trains her well. She has to buy out the opportune time, because the child’s eyesight is gradually diminishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The sister of the lady, who also experienced much opposition from her mother and relatives, continued to study too, often coming secretly to me for the study in spite of threats and efforts to intimidate her by the police. Now both sisters are baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The wife of their older brother, upon seeing their faith, started to study too, but in secret. When she abandoned her Moslem practices and began to live according to the truth, her family understood what had happened and beat her severely. But she continues to study.” What a fine result because of making opportunities for incidental witnessing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year no court action against us for preaching the good news was taken. Only the sister who studied with the two persons mentioned in the experience above was arrested and spent one day in jail after the Moslem police found out that she was the one who helped these two persons to abandon the Moslem religion. But when she was presented to the investigating judge, he refused to open a case against her and set her free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite many difficulties surrounding them, Jehovah’s witnesses have had great joy in observing how they have been moving along with the New World society. This has imparted strength to them, and their spirit of devotion has been balanced with patience. They have particularly learned how important it is to keep to theocratic principles in order to enjoy peace and unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year the authorities no longer applied their former measures of outright suppression of the publishers. There have been no new arrests or searchings of homes. They only continued to punish brothers for their refusal to serve in the army. Of course, atheistic propaganda is still being carried on by functionaries, but there has been less public activity about us in the press and on the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother had to move to another city. The people living there seemed to have never heard about the truth. But after a while he found that there were two more brothers living in that city. After analyzing their work, the three started out preaching; of course, not according to the method of fishermen, but like hunters. They did not know any people there and had to look out that they did not get in touch with the “wolves,” instead of “sheep.” They prayed to Jehovah to direct them to his “sheep” that might live in the city, and their prayers were answered. They got in contact with a young woman who had been brought up a Greek Orthodox. Her parents had been very religious people. Despite the constant spreading of atheism, the woman had kept her strong faith in God according to her religious understanding. But when she learned the truth from the publishers, she soon got rid of all religious superstition and prejudice. She helped the brothers find two more “sheep,” her old mother and her younger sister. But that was only the beginning. Today there are forty people associated with these brothers, thirty of whom learned the truth within the past six months. Their prayers have been answered by Jehovah in a fuller measure than they ever expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man who had been a Communist from his early youth was given the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book to read by his wife, who had started talking to him about what she had learned in her studies with a publisher. He was enthusiastic about the book, saying that he had never before read such a wonderful book. He did not go to sleep at night and read it through in two days. Then he started to study it, taking notes of it, and then even copying the whole book. He said that the book had opened his eyes and that he now very well perceived where the truth was and where deceit. Previously he often came home drunk, beat up his wife and smashed their dishes. He changed his course of life, and peace, happiness and joy entered into their home. They have started preaching to their closest relatives. After he attended his first meeting with the brothers, he said: “I have been a member of the Communist youth organization for many years, and then also became a member of the Communist party, but never in all my life did I experience so much happiness and joy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another old-time Communist was given the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font5">book to read. He had been quite receptive when the truth was preached to him. Afterward he told the publisher: “When I first started to read the book I felt like getting gooseflesh. I got so agitated that my whole body trembled, and I did not know what was going on with me. I could not keep myself controlled. I saw at once that it was the truth, which I had been seeking for such a long time, wondering whether it did exist at all in the world, but now I saw with my own eyes that I had found what I had been longing for.” Thus the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font5"> book was able to take away the blinding veil of Communist doctrine from the eyes of this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In a little while” the combined assault of Caesar and Babylon the Great ‘would have exterminated us in the earth,’ ‘but Jehovah was with us like a terrible mighty one. That is why the very ones persecuting us stumbled and did not prevail.’ (Ps. 119:87; Jer. 20:11) How well these inspired words apply in our case is seen by the fact that a special pioneer was ordered never to leave the city of his residence without special permission, because a bishop of a neighboring town, to whose people the brother was occasionally preaching, had requested it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two brothers who started working at a school as teachers were ordered by the Ministry of Interior to stop teaching after three months of satisfactory work and despite the intercession of the school’s administration and the Minister of Education in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another two brothers who are school pupils were also expelled from their school that is administered by Catholic priests, just for being Jehovah’s witnesses. Then in both Cairo and Alexandria many well-known brothers and sisters were summoned by the Investigations Department in order to be given a “last warning” to stop worshiping in groups as well as preaching Jehovah’s kingdom, just because the priests complained against our way of praying and glorifying God. One of the brothers was beaten several times and measures were taken for his deportation, although he is an Egyptian citizen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What encouraged Babylon the Great to fight us in such a fierce and confident way was the fact that, although our Christian work has been banned since 1960 by the Ministry of Social Affairs, now, on the 29th of October 1964, the Ministry of Commerce and Economy has seen fit to ban us again in response to the recommendation of the office of the Arab Boycott of Israel, as if we were a commercial organization. However, despite the gloomy appearance of the situation and the numerous and thorny problems we were faced with, we enjoyed a very blessed and fruitful year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul certainly knew the value of association with those of like precious faith. That is why he said to the Hebrews: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) How true that statement is today! When reading the experiences in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> we see what benefit it is to the Lord’s people to associate together. We see, too, how they have incited one another to love and fine works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the coming year we will have in mind constantly that “we should not neglect the house of our God.” (Neh. 10:39) So Jehovah’s witnesses will stay even closer together, if that is at all possible. How true it is: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (Prov. 13:20) Jehovah’s witnesses did not fare badly during the past year. They stayed close together within the confines of Jehovah’s theocratic organization. They received Jehovah’s rich blessing and have proved themselves to be “wise persons.” They have seen to it that time was arranged in their schedule so that they could spend 8,439,332 more hours in the preaching activity than during the previous year. What a tremendous witness they gave in the 171,247,644 hours that they devoted to the field ministry! True, we had many more publishers in the field service than during the previous year to help us do that. In fact, regularly each month there were 32,398 more publishers witnessing than during the previous year. Undoubtedly, all of these will ‘not neglect the house of their God’ and will continue publishing the good news of the Kingdom during the 1966 service year. They will bring a knowledge of the truth to many more interested ones and show them how they can become “men of good will.” With the continual increase in home Bible studies more interested persons will be found; and you publishers have certainly increased the number of Bible studies. The increase over the previous year was 29,228.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the very outstanding features of this past year’s report was the 11-percent increase in the number of pioneers sharing in the Kingdom service. We reached new high marks of 8,126 special pioneers, which includes the missionaries around the world, and 39,727 regular pioneers, which number includes circuit and district servants. That made a grand total of 47,853 ministers devoting all their time, or the greater portion of it, at least 100 hours or more, in field service each month. There were 4,915 more pioneers than during the previous year. Wonderful indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You. supported the special pioneer work and missionary service, district and circuit servant activity in a fine manner too during the past year. The Society was called upon to spend $3,772,532.23 to take care of these fields of service. We are very grateful to all the brothers throughout the world who contributed some of their earnings so that it was possible for the Society to keep all these special pioneers and missionaries in the field, and at the same time care for the expense involved in moving the circuit and district servants from place to place, in the 24,158 congregations that are organized around the woi-ld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the earth there are 1,979 circuits and 233 districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> shows, many brothers had excellent experiences in using the magazines </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> The increase in the distribution of magazines alone over the previous year amounted to 8,342,261 and the increase in subscriptions obtained was 62,710 above the previous year. If it be Jehovah’s will and the brothers are able to maintain during the 1966 service year a similar increase in the distribution of individual copies of the magazines and in obtaining new subscriptions, we feel quite certain that during the year we will be required to bring our average printing for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> up to five million copies of each issue. Its distribution grew very rapidly during the past year. And </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> will move right along with a like increase too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have every reason to rejoice because of their inciting one another to love and fine works. They have shown their Christian qualities not only in the congregation but among those with whom they have become acquainted in their field ministry. Due to the love they have shown through the time they have spent in the field service and in Bible study work, they have aided 64,393 individuals to see the importance of being baptized in symbol of their dedication to the doing of Jehovah’s will. This is indeed a wonderful thing, for it means that Jehovah’s organization is growing, and that at the rate of well over 60,000 each year for the past five years. It truly makes our hearts glad to see so many becoming God’s “men of good will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a real pleasure to go through all the reports from the Branches. While many of our brothers have been enduring hardships with prison experiences, still others were able to work freely and enjoy the opportunity of helping many to be gathered to Jehovah’s side. At the same time there was a slowing down by some in their diligence to meet with and share in Kingdom service with their brothers. The whole body of Jehovah’s people feels these things, such as a slowing down, even though thousands do not themselves stop their preaching work and their constant association with those of like precious faith. The prayers of our brothers are continually going up to Jehovah on behalf of those having difficult times behind the Iron Curtain and in other troublesome areas such as Spain and Portugal. In every congregation the brothers are encouraging one another and are urging one another not to ‘neglect the house of their God.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In reading the report for the 1965 service year we are not discouraged but we rejoice in the progress made under the blessing of Jehovah. The report shows progress is steady and our brothers, for the most part, are putting up a hard fight for the faith and are enduring. There is evidence of unity throughout the world from the reports received from 197 different lands and islands where the good news was preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now we look ahead to the 1966 service year with renewed vigor and joy. It gives me great pleasure to pass along to all the readers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> an expression in all the reports to the effect that the witnesses of Jehovah in one country want their warm love and good wishes expressed to their brothers in every other country of the world. It is indeed a pleasure to print the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> just to convey this message alone, because the love of God’s servants for one another throughout the world is truly great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My prayer in behalf of all of you is that Jehovah will bless you richly as together we press on, doing Jehovah’s will. Please accept my warm love and best wishes for all of you as, together, none of us “neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It was good to see 1,680 persons gathered together in two auditoriums at the main offices of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1965. It was the occasion of the annual meeting, which was called to order at ten o’clock in the morning by N. H. Knorr, the president of the Society. A few minutes before calling the meeting to order, the day’s text, as it appears in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> was read and discussed by Brother J. O. Groh, and after asking Jehovah’s blessing the business meeting began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The secretary of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania reported that the membership at the time was 435. There were 425 members there in person or by proxy. The terms of two directors expired, namely, F. W. Franz and J. O. Groh.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark122">2</a></sup> Both of these were nominated to succeed themselves and were unanimously voted in as directors again for a period of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some reports were made concerning the work being done in other countries and the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, spoke to this very large group of Jehovah’s witnesses on the subject “Neglecting the House of the Creator of Heaven and Earth.” This proved to be an interesting and encouraging discourse. It stressed the importance of fully supporting the worship of Jehovah by attending meetings in the congregations of God’s people and participating in such congregational meetings and activity. This is very important in order to safeguard each individual in the congregation as well as the congregation itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The material that was presented in this discourse at the annual meeting will appear in the December 15, 1965, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The meeting was closed with prayer by the president of the Society, beseeching Jehovah’s blessing upon his faithful servants around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On October 7, 1965, in the office of the president in Brooklyn, New York, the board of directors met in order to elect the officers for the coming year. All the members of the board of directors were present, namely, N. H. Knorr, F. W. Franz, Grant Suiter, T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle, J. O. Groh and M. G. Henschel. During the meeting the following officers were elected: N. H. Knorr as president, F. W. Franz as vice-president, Grant Suiter as secretary and treasurer, and J. O. Groh as assistant secretary and treasurer. All were voted into office unanimously. The president read to the board the financial report of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for the period ending August 31, 1965. The president gave a general report concerning plans for conventions in 1966 in Canada and the United States, and also a series of winter conventions in Central and South America in December 1966 and January 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the members of the board of directors are members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn and have their respective duties to perform daily, and they certainly appreciate their privileges of service in Jehovah’s visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBEE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF NEW YORK, INC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The annual meeting for this Society was held January 2, 1965, at Brooklyn, New York, at the headquarters of the Society. For the information of Jehovah’s witnesses, the directors of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., are: N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer, and J. O. Groh, assistant secretary and treasurer; G. M. Couch, director; M. H. Larson, director, and L. K. Greenlees, director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was recorded in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> H. H. Riemer finished his earthly course on March 31, 1965, and shortly thereafter Brother L. K. Greenlees was elected as a director of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., to fill the vacancy made by the death of Brother Riemer. Brother J. O. Groh, a director, was made the assistant secretary and treasurer in the place of Brother Riemer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>Yeartext for 1966</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;We </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">should not neglect the house of our God.” —Neh. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nehemiah loved Jehovah God. He saw the need to revive true worship in Jerusalem again. He saw the need of full support of the temple, which Nehemiah considered as “the house of our God.” He knew the history of the Jewish people, how they fell away from true worship. He knew that, “as for our kings, our princes, our priests and our forefathers, they have not performed your law, nor paid attention to your commandments or to your testimonies with which you bore witness against them.” (Neh. 9:34) He shows how they did not serve Jehovah and did not turn back from their bad practices before the time came for stern action. Nehemiah knew that things must change. True worship at the house of their God was a necessary thing. So Nehemiah organized the whole temple arrangement. He provided for temple service and its workers, and all this was done so that “we should not neglect the house of our God.” —Neh. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nehemiah’s zeal for Jehovah’s house was great, and he wanted all those associated with him to have the same kind of zeal. He expresses his feelings very beautifully in these words: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” (Neh. 13:14) We can see from reading the book of Nehemiah that he was certainly devoted to Jehovah’s house and he knew the value of keeping it clean so that when God’s people assembled there they would hear the law and live according to the commandment of God. It was important that the priests and all those attending to things in the house of God live circumspectly and decently and set the right example. The overseer should take the lead in true worship so that all the others might know what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How is your feeling toward the house of God? Do you look well to the interests of God’s work in your Kingdom Hall? Do you attend meetings there regularly? Are you happy to receive the instruction that is presented there? Do you enjoy the study of the Bible and the comments of your brothers? Do you go away refreshed and built up and do you feel determined, as Nehemiah did, that we must not neglect the “house of our God”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus did not neglect the house of his God, did he? “He came to Nazareth, where he had been reared; and, according to his custom on the sabbath day, he entered into the synagogue.” (Luke 4:16) He was given the privilege of reading a part of the book of Isaiah, and those there heard him make comment on this scripture. “And they all began ... to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth.” (Luke 4:22) Do you enjoy assembling with God’s people in the Kingdom Hall, there to listen to the Word of God as spoken by your brothers and sisters? Do they build you up? Do you build them up by your words?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You remember Paul; he followed in Jesus’ footsteps. “So according to Paul’s custom he went inside to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures.” (Acts 17:2) Paul did not neglect the house of his God. Why should we? It is most important in these days that are so troublesome to stay with Jehovah’s people, and the best place to stay with them is in the “house of our God.” Here we get spiritual strength. Our faith is made strong and our knowledge increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our appreciation for our heavenly Father and for his Word of truth grows. All of us have seen what happens to those who have neglected the house of their God. Why follow in their footsteps? Why not taste of the goodness of Jehovah and dwell in his house all the days of your life?</span></p>

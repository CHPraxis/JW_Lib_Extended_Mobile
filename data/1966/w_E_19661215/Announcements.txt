FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s witnesses know that the things that God says in his Word are true, and by their ministry they endeavor to aid others to have that same conviction. (Rom. 3:4) For that reason, during December they will be calling at the homes of persons everywhere to talk to them about the Bible, and, to aid in a study of God’s Word, they will offer them the modern-English New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures and the 416-page book Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, with two booklets, for only $1.50.
1967 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
Freedom has taken on a new meaning due to the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies this past summer. Likewise, interest in the preaching of the liberating effects of God’s kingdom has been stimulated on a worldwide scale. Therefore, the 1967 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses gains new importance as it brings you an informative and heartwarming report of this modern-day example of preaching as Jesus did it. Get your copy for only 50c. A beautifully illustrated calendar for 1967 will also bring you pleasure throughout the coming year. It is only 25c. Send today.

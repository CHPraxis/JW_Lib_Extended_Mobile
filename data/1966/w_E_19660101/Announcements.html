<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One who has come to know Jehovah God through study of his Word, the Bible, knows that the worship of God ought to come first in his life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6:33</a>) To aid other sincere persons to appreciate the importance of wholehearted worship of the true God, throughout January Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all persons a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>with three Bible-study booklets, for $1.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>NOW—IN JUST TWO VOLUMES</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Five years ago an index to all the publications of the Watch Tower Society from 1930 to 1960 was released. It is called “Watch Tower Publications <em>Index </em>1930-1960” and is still available for $1. Since then, annual supplements have been released, which are now, for the first time, available in one volume for only 50c. Send for <em>Watch Tower Publications Index 1961-1965. </em>If you do not have the 1930 to 1960 <em>Index, </em>send for it also and have, in the two bound volumes, a complete source reference, both subject and Scriptural, to the publications of the Watch Tower Society since 1930. Send today; an invaluable aid to Bible study.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
One who has come to know Jehovah God through study of his Word, the Bible, knows that the worship of God ought to come first in his life. (Matt. 4:10; 6:33) To aid other sincere persons to appreciate the importance of wholehearted worship of the true God, throughout January Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three Bible-study booklets, for $1.
NOW—IN JUST TWO VOLUMES
Five years ago an index to all the publications of the Watch Tower Society from 1930 to 1960 was released. It is called “Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1960” and is still available for $1. Since then, annual supplements have been released, which are now, for the first time, available in one volume for only 50c. Send for Watch Tower Publications Index 1961-1965. If you do not have the 1930 to 1960 Index, send for it also and have, in the two bound volumes, a complete source reference, both subject and Scriptural, to the publications of the Watch Tower Society since 1930. Send today; an invaluable aid to Bible study.

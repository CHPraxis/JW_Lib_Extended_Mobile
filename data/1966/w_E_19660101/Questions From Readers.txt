● The pillars belonging to the porch of Solomon’s temple were named Jachin and Boaz. Do these names have any significance?—J.G., U.S.A.
Yes, they do. The pillars evidently served an emblematic purpose. One can better appreciate this when he realizes that they were immense, each of them being twenty-seven feet high and about six feet in diameter. They were made of copper and had capitals ornamented with forms of pomegranates and lilies. Occupying, as they did, a prominent place in front of the porch of the temple, these pillars were indeed conspicuous.—1 Ki. 7:15-22.
The right-hand pillar was named Jachin, meaning “He will firmly establish.” The one on the left was called Boaz, possibly meaning “In strength.” Since Hebrew is read from right to left, the right-hand pillar named Jachin would first command the attention of the Hebrew in ancient times. Thereafter he would note the pillar named Boaz. In that order these names would apparently convey to his mind the thought, “He will firmly establish in strength.”
These pillars stood free and did not support any part of the building. However, it seems that their underlying significance was that God would firmly establish the temple in strength. Of course, this would also indicate that Jehovah approved of true worship as practiced there.

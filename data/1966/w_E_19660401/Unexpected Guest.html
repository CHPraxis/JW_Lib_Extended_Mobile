<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A Witness living in Maryland reports that he was at home one Friday night getting ready for the meeting when a friend called whom he had not seen for five years. As they talked, he explained to his friend how he became one of Jehovah’s witnesses. As time passed, the Witness wondered what to do about his unexpected guest. “Then the doorbell rang and the brother was there to take me to the Kingdom Hall,” he reports. “This encouraged me and we invited him to come with us to the Kingdom Hall. He agreed. He enjoyed both meetings and agreed to having a home Bible study. I’ve been studying with him ever since, and he has attended several meetings.”</p>

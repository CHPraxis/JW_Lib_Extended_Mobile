FIELD MINISTRY
True faith is something for which one must put up a hard fight, not with a sword of steel, but with “the sword of the spirit,” which is God’s Word. The true fighter for Christian faith must exert himself to keep his own life in harmony with Bible principles, and he is obligated to expose falsehood and uphold God’s truth. During November, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share in this organized fight for the faith, pointing out to others what the Bible teaches, and offering to all persons the new Bible-study aid Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, with a booklet, for 50c.
“LIFE EVERLASTING—IN FREEDOM OF THE SONS OF GOD”
Here is a new book especially written to enable you to meet today’s problems with confidence. It offers an encouraging and realistic view of freedom that can change your whole future and put new meaning into your life. The principles of conduct it recommends are time-tested and are taken from the highest authority on human activity that exists, God’s own Word, the Holy Bible. Learn how the Bible is still our safest guide and the outstanding champion of freedom in our modern society. Entitled “Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God,” hard bound, 416 pages.

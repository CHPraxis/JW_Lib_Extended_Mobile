<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Between sunset and the actual darkness there is a short period of evening twilight when the stars begin to be seen. This time was called <em>nesheph </em>by the ancient Hebrews and evidently is the time meant by the expression “between the two evenings” found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:9-20:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 7:9</a>) Similarly, at the end of the night’s darkness there is a morning twilight leading to the dawn and this was expressed by the same Hebrew word. Thus, the writer at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:147-19:119:147" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:147</a> says: “I have been up early in the morning twilight.”</p>

‘I Have My Religion’
One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Jaboticabal, Brazil, had the pleasure of meeting a lady who showed a great deal of interest in his doorstep sermon. However, as the minister finished his Bible message, the woman said: “Fine! I enjoyed your explanation, but I am not interested because I already have my religion, although I do not know the name of it. But I do know it is the truth. I learned it by means of some books I have here in my home.” The Witness asked her to show him the publications. To his surprise and pleasure, the books were “Let God Be True” and What Has Religion Done for Mankind? The minister showed the woman that the books were published by Jehovah’s witnesses. He also arranged for a regular Bible study to be conducted in her home. Within a short time she asked for two studies a week instead of one. Progressing in knowledge, she is already taking part in telling the good news of the Kingdom to others, using the publications that helped her to learn of God’s truth.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True faith is something for which one must put up a hard fight, not with a sword of steel, but with “the sword of the spirit,” which is God’s Word. The true fighter for Christian faith must exert himself to keep his own life in harmony with Bible principles, and he is obligated to expose falsehood and uphold God’s truth. During November, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share in this organized fight for the faith, pointing out to others what the Bible teaches, and offering to all persons the new Bible-study aid <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, </em>with a booklet, for 50c.</p>

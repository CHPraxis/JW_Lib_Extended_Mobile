Evening and Morning Twilight
◆ Between sunset and the actual darkness there is a short period of evening twilight when the stars begin to be seen. This time was called nesheph by the ancient Hebrews and evidently is the time meant by the expression “between the two evenings” found at Exodus 12:6. (Prov. 7:9) Similarly, at the end of the night’s darkness there is a morning twilight leading to the dawn and this was expressed by the same Hebrew word. Thus, the writer at Psalm 119:147 says: “I have been up early in the morning twilight.”

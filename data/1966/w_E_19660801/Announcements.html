<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses regularly attend meetings that are designed to train them to become mature ministers, able to aid others to understand the Bible. During August they will continue to share in that service, offering persons everywhere personal home Bible instruction free of charge. As an aid in such home study they will be glad to provide interested persons with the fine 416-page textbook <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </em>and a Scriptural booklet, for 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>KEEP INFORMED ON GOD’S KINGDOM!</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Do you long for a government that will be able to right all wrongs, administer justice equally, provide for every need, ensure the peace and guarantee security for everyone? Do you think such a government is possible? or that we will live to see such a government? You pray for it when you pray, “Thy kingdom come,” and the Bible gives evidence that our generation will see it bring great changes to earth. <em>The Watchtower </em>is dedicated to keeping you informed about the progress of God’s purpose in this regard. Read it regularly. Send now. One year, $1.</p>

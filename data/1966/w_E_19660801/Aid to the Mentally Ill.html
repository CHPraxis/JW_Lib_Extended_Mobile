<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The truth from God’s Word has great power. The psalmist realized this and entreated God, “Send out your light and your truth. May these themselves lead me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 43:3</a>) Many times the light and truth from the Bible has brought direction and purpose to the minds of distressed individuals, even those suffering from mental illnesses. An experience received from Michigan well exemplifies this:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A woman had been a mental patient for over ten years. During that time she received regular psychiatric treatment, was given shock treatments and attended a school for the recovery of the mentally ill for a period of a year. Additionally, she took some $5,000 worth of medication for her condition. In spite of all the costly treatment and medication, on a number of occasions she contemplated suicide.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, one day her husband, who had some association with Jehovah’s witnesses, asked her, “Whom are you praying to?” “To God,” was the reply. Then he encouraged her to use God’s name Jehovah in her prayer. That made her stop and think. In time one of Jehovah’s witnesses began conducting a weekly Bible study in the home. On his invitation the couple attended a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. The women writes, “I knew that this was what I had been searching for all my life.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">She continues: “After returning home from the assembly I began attending congregation meetings regularly. I was then able to discontinue all medication. Also, up until that time I had been a heavy smoker, but I was able to break that habit. About that time I called my psychiatrist, and he wanted to know how I was progressing. I told him that I was feeling better than I had felt in all of my life. He asked if I was still on my medication. When I told him that I had quit, he inquired as to how I was able to do that so suddenly. My reply was that I was now associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. He responded by saying that he wished that all the mentally ill could find a cure like that.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since that time both she and her husband have received training in the congregation Theocratic Ministry School and they are serving as ministers of the good news of God’s kingdom. Truly, it is the course of wisdom to look to Jehovah and his Word for light and truth.</p>

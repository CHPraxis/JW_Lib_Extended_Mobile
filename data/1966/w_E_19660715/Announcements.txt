FIELD MINISTRY
It is important for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses to keep in mind the Scriptural counsel not to “neglect the house of our God.” And it is a great kindness to others to encourage them to attend the meetings of the congregation too. At their weekly Bible studies held in relatively small groups in various neighborhoods throughout their congregation territory, Jehovah’s witnesses are at present studying the fine book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” With a view to sharing this vital information with others, during July they will offer that book, with a booklet, to other interested persons on a contribution of 50c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AS THE plane taxied slowly along the runway at Gatwick Airport, London, and steadily increased speed, my wife and I wondered what kind of adventure we were embarking upon. We were leaving behind all our friends and relatives and were winging our way toward tropical West Africa!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What had made us decide to move to Africa, particularly as we have two small children? Since I had five years’ teaching experience behind me, my wife and I decided that we could use this to the best advantage in a different part of the world, where the need for preachers of the Kingdom good news was greater. We were both in good health, with two healthy children, and had a teaching appointment to go to in Africa, which offered suitable accommodation and the security of a contract.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We knew that there would be many adjustments in our lives to meet the new situation, but as the official in London had said during my interview for the post, “a missionary spirit is needed to accept a teaching post in Africa.” Little did he realize that this was the most important reason that influenced us to take this step! Our primary desire was to help African people understand more about God and his purposes toward all mankind.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We arrived in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, in the middle of the rainy season. We were soon to learn that it rains more in one day here than in several weeks in England. However, one soon grows accustomed to it, and at least it is warm rain! The rain seemed to make everything grow in profusion, with palm trees, orange trees, banana plants and paw-paw trees in abundance. We were struck by the amount of greenery, in all its different shades, such a pleasant contrast to the edge of the Sahara Desert we had flown over previously.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">There were tall, modern buildings in Freetown, but on our journey by land-rover up-country to our new home we found most villagers living in mud-walled, thatch-roofed houses, some round, others square. For the most part they were clean dwellings. The town where we now live and work is 130 miles northeast of Freetown in more open country, where rice is widely grown as the main part of the local diet.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Perhaps the most striking thing we noticed was the friendliness of the local people of the <span id="page571" class="pageNum" data-no="571" data-before-text="571"></span>Temne tribe. We noticed this especially when we spent time helping them to understand more about God’s Word, the Bible. They are very cheerful and friendly in spite of the rigorous life they lead. Most hospitably provide a seat when we visit them in their homes. Many times they share what fruit they have with us without any thought of payment, even though they do not have very much of this world’s wealth.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There is much superstition and tradition among the West African people, as indeed there is in most other countries, only in different forms. Thus, when visiting the local villages in our preaching work we try to point out the way God wants us to live our lives, as shown in his Word. By constantly calling back on those who show interest in God’s promises, we try to help them to worship him openly and in spirit and truth.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Many men and women who have come to believe in God have overcome great difficulties in order to be able to worship him in accordance with his Guidebook for clean living. Most people openly practice polygamy, which is still widely accepted in West Africa. Yet upon learning of the Christian standard of one man, one wife, many have shown their sincerity by keeping only their senior legal wife and putting the others away. Others have made complete breaks with superstition and tradition, again showing the firmness of their faith. After more than one year here, we find that the vast majority of Africans are God-fearing people who respect God’s Word the Bible, delighting to hear of the promises God makes for perfect peace and happiness among all the races of mankind, here on this earth.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Looking back over the past months in tropical West Africa, we realize now that most difficulties disappear as one grows accustomed to the new life. No longer do we hesitate in going to talk to Africans in their natural surroundings, as we realize more and more how anxious they are to be helpful, especially when one is able to use even just a few words of their native language. This makes them feel that someone is taking an interest in them.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Our fears about our health and safety are certainly no greater than they were in England. By being a little more careful over personal hygiene, we find we have less illness than before coming here! Our two small children are extremely healthy and seem to thrive on the sunshine, which is almost year-round except during the height of the rainy season. Even the extremely hot temperature is bearable. In fact, it amazes us how the human body can adapt itself so well and in so short a time.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Our children have plenty of space in which to run around and have had a much wider variety of pets than they could possibly have had in England. Some of the animals we have had during the past year include a baby deer, three monkeys, chickens and ducks, a dog, rabbits, a goat and even a small iguana-like creature, which fortunately left us before it had a chance to grow too big!</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Perhaps one of the greatest difficulties in moving to a far-off country is leaving former friends and relatives. We have overcome this to some extent by the use of tape-recorded messages. Also, we have learned how to develop and print our own films, which help to provide a visible account of Africa and its peoples to our friends in England.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">There is a minority group of white people here, but one has to be careful not to allow these associations to encroach on one’s time for preaching God’s Word, attending congregation meetings, conducting home Bible studies and making return visits to persons who show an interest in the Bible’s message. We are in Africa to give a helping hand to those thirsting for knowledge, particularly the knowledge of God found in his Word, the Bible. And working with our loving fellow African Witnesses, attending the same congregational meetings and Bible assemblies and studying with them helps us to lead a very full and enjoyable life, offsetting any feeling of loneliness.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In conclusion, one might ask if there is any advice we could pass on to others contemplating a move to another country such as we have made. A vital thing for anyone with family responsibilities would be to obtain employment first, preferably covered by a sound contract. One should be reasonably healthy and ready to adapt oneself to meet the challenge that a country like Africa brings to those not raised there. One should be prepared to forego some of the luxuries of this modern world. But in doing so he will gain the inner satisfaction of doing a worthwhile work, and along with it, too, the realization that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving. That is what we have found in tropical West Africa.—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

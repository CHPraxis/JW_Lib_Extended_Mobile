<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb">LIKE the taunting from wicked King Sennacherib of ancient Assyria, so today Satan keeps up his taunting of the true God Jehovah by speaking abusively of His anointed witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:21-23:37:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 37:21-33</a>) By their faithfully enduring the Babylonish hostility against them, the Job-like anointed ones enable Jehovah, as He says, to “make a reply to him [Satan] that is taunting me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) In the meantime, in their championing Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship on earth they bear up under much reproach. “With murder against <span id="page562" class="pageNum" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>my bones those showing hostility to me have reproached me, while they say to me all day long: ‘Where is your God?’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:10-19:42:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 42:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To demonstrate the full extent of the modern parallel of the experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses today with those of ancient Job, we will now highlight cases of Babylonish hostility of the clergy against the anointed witnesses on each of the taunts made against ancient Job by his three Babylonized companions. This will be done by taking each of the speeches of Job’s companions in turn and showing how the clergy of Christendom have spoken in the same <em>sibboleth </em>fashion as those ancient agents of Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:12:6-7:12:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judg. 12:6</a>) As this develops it will be observed that the sectarian religious statements have the same ring of hostility as the pronouncements of ancient Eliphaz, Zophar and Bildad.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[101]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In the frame of thinking of Eliphaz, the clergy claim in effect that it is the religiously unclean, the sinners, the biased ones that bring upon themselves merited reproach and divine punishment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:2-18:4:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 4:2-8</a>) A Roman Catholic monsignor writes in a nationwide Catholic newspaper in the United States a harsh condemnation of the Bible Society of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“Rejecting the idea of the Holy Trinity, the Bible society translation [the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, </em>1950] replaces the phrase ‘the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,’ used frequently [once] throughout the King James version with ‘the spirit and the water and the blood.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 5:7</a>) . . .

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Making a proper defense not only of their own rightness but also of the Sovereign Godship of Jehovah as did ancient Job, the modern Witnesses say: “I have not hidden the sayings of the Holy One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:10-18:6:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 6:10</a>) In an open letter dated October 11, 1950, a printed six-page reply was published by Jehovah’s witnesses in their <em>Watchtower </em>magazine of December 1, 1950. (Pp. 469-474) There overwhelming evidences were published proving beyond doubt that Jehovah’s witnesses not only are not biased in their <em>New World Translation, </em>but have honestly reproduced the sense and wording of the original-language texts. Note the above <em>Watchtower </em>answer to the charge of biased tampering with the Bible.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si"><em>“The New World Translation </em>has rewritten no part of the Greek text, not even <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 5:7</a> which is cited in your article as a place where Jehovah’s witnesses clash with the trinitarian doctrine. . . . This is a literal translation of the Greek text by the above-named Augustinus Merk, S.J. . . . it is also a literal translation of the Greek text by the other Roman Catholic scholar, Joseph M. Bover, S.J. . . . Your own precious Vatican Manuscript No. 1209 of the early 4th century does not contain the words, but brands them spurious.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Thus was crushingly demonstrated the authentic nature of the <em>New World Translation </em>and the falsity of the charge against the anointed witnesses.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In addition <em>The Watchtower </em>vindicated its use of “Jehovah” this way:</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“Why, then, does the <em>New World Translation </em>use the name Jehovah 237 times in its main text? Is it due to ‘shallow scholarship,’ as you insinuate? No. . . . In addition to the 19 Hebrew versions, it cites versions of the ‘New Testament’ in 38 languages besides English and Hebrew where the translators use a vernacular <span id="page563" class="pageNum" data-no="563" data-before-text="563"></span>form of the Hebrew tetragrammaton [Hebrew occurrence of the divine name].”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Then <em>The Watchtower </em>proceeded to identify a long series of Catholic authorities and their usages of the name Jehovah down through the centuries, such as Thomas Cardinal de Vio Cajetanus in his <em>Commentary on the Pentateuch. </em>Who, then, displays bias—the Catholic clergy or Jehovah’s witnesses? You decide.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[103]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>From ancient Babylonish times, religious leaders like Eliphaz have appealed to emotional influences obtained from invisible spirits or demons to build up their religious posture rather than build faith based on the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:12-18:4:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 4:12-17</a>) Recently one of the Pentecostal sects emotionally belittled the Bible knowledge of Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">“I wish it were possible for everyone in the Watchtower Society, more than a million and one half ministers and over fifty million <em>brain washed </em>followers, to <em>feel </em>what I am <em>feeling, </em>and sense what I can <em>sense. </em>. . . If they can do it [their worldwide work] with <em>power that is not of God, </em>what can we do if we are anointed by the Spirit of God . . .

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Here the religionists appeal to “feeling” and a “sense” of something unseen and indefinable. The result? They exhort violence and hostility, “tear” and “shake.” But Jesus said, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 22:39</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[105]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>In reply Jehovah’s witnesses contrast their unified source of spiritual abundance with the spiritually sickening table spread by the clergy in their “independence.”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“What orthodox religious organization in Christendom provides new spiritual food for these critical times? Are not the fundamentalists still offering the same dry husks, still prattling the same centuries-old creeds, and monotonously repeating again and again their few basic doctrines borrowed from paganism?

Instead, they scuttle the Bible, dismissing it as myth and legend, at best only good literature, and offer science and evolution, psychology and psychiatry, in an endeavor to be popular with a materialistic civilization. God bluntly says Christendom’s ‘tables are full of vomit.’ [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:8-23:28:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 28:8</a>] Among them spiritual famine reigns supreme.

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" data-rel-pid="[116]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Orthodoxy continues to be confounded by the crushing replies of Jehovah’s witnesses when the clergy wildly accuse them of every sort of badness and error. Like Eliphaz of old, in their final round of the controversy they in effect say: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there be no end to your errors?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:5-18:22:5" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 22:5</a>) This sort of unjustified attack is exemplified by a “National Catholic Monthly for the Family” entitled the “Home Messenger” in its issue of August 1955, in an article: “They Call Themselves the Witnesses of Jehovah.” The writer was exposed in publishing thirty-five lies, falsehoods and misstatements in his base attempt to prove the Witnesses as bad ones.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" data-rel-pid="[116]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>The <em>Awake! </em>magazine of April 8, 1956, (pages 17, 18) publishes the Witnesses’ full reply under the heading “The Hypocrisy of Men Who Speak Lies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:3" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:1-3</a>) A few extracts from the reply will reveal the baseness of this clergy attack.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="si">“The article further claims that Jehovah’s witnesses believe that ‘Christ is floating around in the air,’ and that they expected Christ to come visibly in 1874, and then in 1914, when nothing had happened in 1874, and upon being disappointed in 1914 they ‘came up with the <span id="page568" class="pageNum" data-no="568" data-before-text="568"></span>dandy that Christ did come in 1914 but invisibly.’ The fact is that Jehovah’s witnesses from the very beginning understood that Christ’s second presence was to be invisible. . . . Next the reader is assured that ‘Jail seems to be the proper background for the witnesses. Their “Judge” Rutherford was in jail when their founder “Pastor” Charles Taze Russell died in 1916,’ and that he was sent there because of sedition and obstructing the draft. However, everyone knows that the United States did not have any sedition or draft act in 1916. The facts are that Judge Rutherford was not sentenced until 1918, more than a year and a half after Pastor Russell had died, and that this conviction was later reversed in court and acknowledged as unjust.”</p>

<p id="p68" data-pid="68" data-rel-pid="[118]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>As has already been presented, religious leaders influenced by Babylonish ways have in all ages avoided referring to the true God by his warm, personal name, commonly used today as <em>Jehovah. </em>This was so as to Job’s three false comforters, it was so on the part of the Jewish sectarians in Jesus’ day and it is abundantly so on the part of the “man of lawlessness” class, Christendom’s clergy, in these last days. Apostate leaders have Babylonishly pressured Bible translators to take out the divine name. Observe the following unfair attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses made by <span id="page569" class="pageNum" data-no="569" data-before-text="569"></span>a Presbyterian seminary professor, accusing them of being inconsistent in their restoration of the divine name in their <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. </em>He charged they were of “Arian theology” (antitrinitarian) and thus colored their translation in an antitrinitarian way when they restored <em>Jehovah </em>in some texts where the Greek word <em>kýrios </em>(Lord) appeared without a definite article and not at other places.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" data-rel-pid="[118]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Jehovah’s witnesses published a three-page reply to this hostility.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="si">“In view of the above we wonder why the faculty member of the Princeton Theological Seminary quoted only partially from page 9 of the above-mentioned Foreword, but left unquoted to you all the above information in the Foreword concerning how the translators determined upon the fitness of putting the divine name back into the Christian Scriptures. . . . The <em>New World Translation </em>is consistent, and it violates no general rule of action set forth in its Foreword when it renders the expression in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:3-46:12:3" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>, as well as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:11-50:2:11" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Philippians 2:11</a>, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ not ‘Jesus is Jehovah.’ So the translators are not to be charged with being influenced by the theology of the antitrinitarian Arius for doing so. . . .

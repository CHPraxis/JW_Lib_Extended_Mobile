The Bible—“Real People and Real Events”
◆ In reference to archaeological projects at Shechem and other cities mentioned in the Bible, Dr. G. Ernest Wright, archaeologist and curator of the Harvard University Semitic Museum, said: “We are not looking for monuments or treasure. In what archeologists of the past might have considered rubble, we are assembling the true facts of our past—the day-to-day life as it was lived five thousand years ago. And it is exciting and rewarding to find that the Bible is not merely a testament of faith, but a testament that arose in relation to real people and real events in the country that is the bridge between Asia and Africa.”—Popular Mechanics, April 1964, page 230.

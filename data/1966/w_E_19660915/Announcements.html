<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God’s truth, as set forth in the Bible, cannot be compromised, even though it may be unpopular, plaguing those who try to ignore God. Moved by love for God and for those who seek righteousness, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to speak the truth boldly during September. As they do so they will offer to conduct a free home Bible study, on a regular basis, with any persons showing interest and they will leave helpful Bible literature, on a small contribution, with those who desire it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“GOD LIVES! HOW WE KNOW IT”</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why do you believe in wind? in electricity? or in the law of gravity? Have you ever seen them? No man has ever seen God either, but is that a sound reason to deny God’s existence? or to say that “God is dead”? “God Lives! How We Know It” is the opening chapter of the internationally popular book <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” </em>Not only does this book prove that God exists but it proves he is a God of purpose, then opens the Bible to help you understand that purpose. You owe it to yourself to find your place in God’s purpose. Send for this book and receive free the timely booklet <em>God’s Way Is Love. </em>Send only 50c.</p>

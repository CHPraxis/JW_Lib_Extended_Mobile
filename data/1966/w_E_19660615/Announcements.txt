FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God is the Provider of a banquet for all peoples. Already men of all nations are feasting on the satisfying spiritual provisions he has made, and it is the privilege of those who do so to invite others to join them. This Jehovah’s witnesses will do during June by offering to others the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” and two booklets, for $1.50.
LEARN MORE FROM THE BIBLE
Home Bible reading and discussion is one of the most unifying family programs in which you can share. But even if you are the only one in your household interested in the Bible, you can still derive great benefit from a systematic, topical consideration of God’s written Word. An invaluable aid in this respect is the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” Hard bound, 416 pages of satisfying reading, with questions at the bottom of each page to stimulate your thinking and aid your memory. The progress of your study will be facilitated by the use of an easy-to-read, modern-English translation of the Bible. The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, bound in green vinyl, and with 1,472 pages, including Concordance, Appendix, maps and illustrations, is just such a Bible. Send $1.50 today and receive, in addition to these two bound volumes, your free copy of the timely booklet God’s Way Is Love.

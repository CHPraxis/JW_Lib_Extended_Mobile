FIELD MINISTRY
Witnesses of Jehovah God have great joy because of their relationship to him and to his anointed king, Jesus Christ. Unselfishly they endeavor to aid others to share that joy, and they do this by taking to them the faith-inspiring message of the Bible. During February, as they share-in this Christian work, they will offer to all persons the outstanding aid to Bible study, The Watchtower, with three booklets, on a $1 contribution.
TRUTH IS ITS OWN REWARD
One thing God cannot do: It is impossible for God to lie! No matter what men may do or say, God always remains true. That is because he is the God of truth. For this reason he caused a faithful servant of his to write in his own Book of Truth: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” To know truth is to receive a high reward indeed. Send for and read the 416-page book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” It is only 50c.

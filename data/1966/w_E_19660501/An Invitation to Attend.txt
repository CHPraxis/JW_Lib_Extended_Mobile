An Invitation to Attend
It is with pleasure that we extend an invitation to you to attend one of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses to be held this summer. The abundance of spiritual food arranged for each of these five-day conventions will be a source of happiness to all who have a love for God’s Word. The principal talk at each assembly will be “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?”
So that you can begin now to make definite arrangements to attend, we list below the locations for the assemblies in the United States, Canada and the British Isles, as well as the rooming headquarters for each city. For assistance in obtaining rooming accommodations, you may write, starting five weeks before the opening day of the assembly you plan to attend, to Watchtower Convention at the rooming address listed for the assembly city.

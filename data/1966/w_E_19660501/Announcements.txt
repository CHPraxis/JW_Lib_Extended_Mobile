A POWER-PACKED POCKETFUL
Have you not enjoyed to the full the powerful message contained in the new book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”? Perhaps you have even carried it with you to work to read on your lunch hour or tucked it under your arm to study when you had some waiting time someplace. Now you can carry it everywhere you go—in your pocket! A new pocket-size edition has just been released for only 60c. It is printed on thin Bible paper and measures only 6 3/8” x 4 1/4” x 9/16”. Send for your copy today.
FIELD MINISTRY
Outstanding love for one another identified first-century Christians, and it is still an unmistakable trait of the Christian witnesses of Jehovah in the twentieth century. (John 13:34, 35) Yet their love is not limited to fellow believers; it reaches out to others, moving them to call at the homes of people everywhere to acquaint them with God’s glorious provision of his kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. As they share in this work during the month of May they will be offering to interested persons a handsomely bound Bible-study aid, along with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.

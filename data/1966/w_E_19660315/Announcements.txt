FIELD MINISTRY
As willing and devoted slaves of Christ who appreciate that they were “bought with a price,” Jehovah’s witnesses will hold fast to the service of their heavenly Master during March by sharing in the ministry. (1 Cor. 7:23) As they do so they will offer to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1.
BE SURE WITH “MAKE SURE”
In a world of uncertainty and confusion it is faith strengthening to be sure. You can be with the truly rewarding Bible handbook “Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine.” It is a compilation of scriptures from the Holy Bible under one hundred and twenty-three main headings to enable you to ascertain quickly what the Bible has to say on these important subjects. Be sure. Build faith in God and his purposes, both in yourself and in others. Send only 75c.

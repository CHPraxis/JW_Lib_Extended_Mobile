“I Was Burning With Anger”
A 15-year-old girl from Knoxville, Tennessee, wrote: “I wanted to express my thanks to you for your new book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. I have enjoyed reading this very much.”
Then she explains what prompted her letter: “I was burning with anger at my brother because he had told on me for not doing something around the house I was supposed to do. Now that we have had it out, I feel guilty and have come up to my room to write to you and to read ‘Why Are My Brother and Sister So Hard to Get Along With?’ (Chapter 6) I know it will be helpful in coping with problems in the future.”
Youths face many questions that require sound judgment: Am I ready to date? How can I get over a crush? What about sex before marriage? How do I know if it’s real love? What career should I choose? How can I cope with peer pressure? For such questions and others, youths need answers that work.
We feel that you will benefit greatly from the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, which has a chapter on each of these questions. You can receive a copy of this attractively illustrated publication by filling in and mailing the coupon.
I would like to receive the 320-page hardbound book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

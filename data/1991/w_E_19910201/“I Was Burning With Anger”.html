<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 15-year-old girl from Knoxville, Tennessee, wrote: “I wanted to express my thanks to you for your new book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>I have enjoyed reading this very much.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then she explains what prompted her letter: “I was burning with anger at my brother because he had told on me for not doing something around the house I was supposed to do. Now that we have had it out, I feel guilty and have come up to my room to write to you and to read ‘Why Are My Brother and Sister So Hard to Get Along With?’ (Chapter 6) I know it will be helpful in coping with problems in the future.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Youths face many questions that require sound judgment: Am I ready to date? How can I get over a crush? What about sex before marriage? How do I know if it’s real love? What career should I choose? How can I cope with peer pressure? For such questions and others, youths need answers that work.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We feel that you will benefit greatly from the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, </em>which has a chapter on each of these questions. You can receive a copy of this attractively illustrated publication by filling in and mailing the coupon.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I would like to receive the 320-page hardbound book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

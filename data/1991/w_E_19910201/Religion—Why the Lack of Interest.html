<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A MAN without religion is like a house without windows.” That is how a Japanese man expressed the need for religious enlightenment to his son, Mitsuo. However, Mitsuo did not take his father’s words seriously. And a growing number of people in Japan, as elsewhere, seem to feel the same way. They are content to be ‘houses without windows’ with little interest in letting religious light shine into their lives.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Hence, when Japan did a National Character Study, 69 percent of its citizens professed that they did not consider themselves religious. Among young people, the ratio was even higher. Similarly, in the once pious Buddhist country of Thailand, 75 percent of those who live in municipal areas do not go to Buddhist temples anymore. In England almost one eighth of Anglican churches have closed over the past 30 years because of disuse.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Japan, though, religious trappings are still very much in evidence. But like expensive pieces of china, they are brought out only on rare occasions​—such as weddings and funerals. Religion is valued more for its role in preserving local culture and family heritage than for spiritual enlightenment. Many view religion merely as a placebo for the weak and troubled; they fail to see any other tangible benefits to be gained from it. ‘Religion is all right if you have time for it or feel the need of it,’ say some, ‘but you have to trust in yourself to make a living and pay the bills.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What is behind this apathy? A number of reasons could be given. First, there is <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>the social environment. Many youths have received little or no religious training. Small wonder, then, that many of those living in a society that places a high value on material pursuits grow up to be materialistic adults.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In some countries the scandalous behavior of greedy and immoral TV evangelists and other prominent religious leaders has also turned people away from religion, as has religion’s involvement in political affairs and war efforts. This is illustrated by what happened in regard to the Shinto religion in Japan. “With the war [World War II] ending in defeat in August 1945, the Shinto shrines faced a severe crisis,” observes the <em>Encyclopædia of the Japanese Religions. </em>Shinto, which fanned the war fervor and promised victory, disappointed the people. The philosophy that there is no God or Buddha quickly spread.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, should we really be content with selfish, short-range viewpoints​—the here and now? Most humans have an inquiring mind. They would like to know where they came from, where they are going, why they are living, and how to live. They thrive on hope. Pushing aside questions about life, or suppressing them with the idea that “these things are unknowable,” is not satisfying. Even the atheist Bertrand Russell talked about having “a curious wild pain​—a searching for something beyond what the world contains.” True religion could end that search. But how? What proof is there that any religion deserves to be taken that seriously?</p>

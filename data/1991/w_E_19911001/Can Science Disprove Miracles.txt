Can Science Disprove Miracles?
Did the miracles of the Bible really happen? There are many, including numerous scientists and religious leaders, who answer no. They feel that belief in miracles belongs to a more superstitious age and that modern science has disproved the possibility of their happening. Hence, the following letter published in The Times of London and signed by a number of scientists is worthy of note. It says:
“It is not logically valid to use science as an argument against miracles. To believe that miracles cannot happen is as much an act of faith as to believe that they can happen. . . . Miracles are unprecedented events. Whatever the current fashions in philosophy or the revelations of opinion polls may suggest, it is important to affirm that science (based as it is upon the observation of precedents) can have nothing to say on the subject. Its ‘laws’ are only generalizations of our experience. Faith rests on other grounds.” (Italics ours.) Indeed, there is no way that modern science can disprove the accounts of the miracles recorded in the Bible.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year a ten-year-old schoolgirl in Italy wrote an essay on the theme “If the Earth Could Talk.” The theme was developed as a dialogue between the earth and a baby who had asked the earth why it was crying. The schoolgirl explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The earth responded that it was polluted by the smog that had produced a greenhouse effect. The earth continued speaking to the baby and said that soon things would change and its future would be better, no thanks to man. The earth’s hope was in Almighty God, its Creator, who did not create the earth for nothing but for it to be inhabited.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The schoolgirl further said: “I took the information from the <em>Awake! </em>magazines of July 22, 1989; September 8, 1989; and September 22, 1989. Thanks to these magazines, my theme won first prize. The second prize was won by one of my classmates whose mother is on my mother’s magazine route. He also took information from the same <em>Awake! </em>magazines.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I thank you for this good and accurate and also simple information that makes us wise. The prize that I won is in the amount of 100,000 lire [about $100, U.S.], and I am sending this money to be used to print more magazines.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We feel that regardless of your religious affiliation, you too will benefit from the fascinating articles in <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I would like to have the magazine <em>Awake! </em>sent to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I believe with complete faith that the Messiah will come, and although he may tarry, yet each day I will wait for his coming.”​<em>—Moses Maimonides </em>(<em>also called Rambam</em>), (<em>1135-1204</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">MESSIAH! Belief in his arrival was nurtured among the Jews for centuries. Yet, when Jesus of Nazareth came, most Jews ultimately rejected him as Messiah. To the Jewish mind, Jesus did not live up to expectations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Messiah” means “anointed one.” Among Jews the term came to stand for a descendant of King David who would usher in a glorious rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:12-10:7:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:12, 13</a>) By Jesus’ day the Jews had suffered for centuries under a series of harsh Gentile rulers. They longed for a political deliverer.<sup>2 </sup>So when Jesus of Nazareth presented himself as the long-awaited Messiah, there was naturally much initial excitement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-22</a>) But to the great disappointment of the Jews, Jesus was no political hero. On the contrary, he claimed that his Kingdom ‘was no part of the world.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Furthermore, Jesus did not then usher in the glorious Messianic age foreseen by the prophet Isaiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:4-23:11:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:4-9</a>) And when Jesus was put to death as a criminal, the nation as a whole lost interest in him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Undeterred by these events, Jesus’ followers continued to proclaim him as the Messiah. What accounted for their remarkable zeal? It was the belief that Jesus’ death fulfilled prophecy, specifically the prophecy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:53:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:13–53:12</a>. This reads in part:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Behold, My servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, . . . for he shot up right forth as a sapling, and as a root out of a dry ground . . . He was despised, and forsaken of men, a man of pains, and acquainted with disease, and as one from whom men hide their face: He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely our diseases he did bear, and our pains he carried . . . He was crushed because of our iniquities: The chastisement of our welfare was upon him, and with his stripes we were healed. All we like sheep did go astray, we turned every one to his own way . . . He was oppressed, though he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, . . . he was cut off out of the land of the living. . . . And they made his grave with the wicked.”​—<em>JP.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>A Suffering Messiah?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Did Isaiah here foretell a suffering, dying Messiah? Most modern Jewish commentators say no. Some claim that the Suffering Servant was the nation of Israel itself during its Babylonian exile. Others relate the suffering to periods such as the Crusades or the Nazi Holocaust.<sup>3 </sup>But does this explanation stand up to close scrutiny? It is true that in some contexts Isaiah does speak of Israel as God’s “servant.” But he speaks of Israel as a wayward, <em>sinful </em>servant! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:19-23:42:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:21-23:44:22" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 44:21, 22</a>) The <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica </em>thus draws this contrast: “The real Israel is sinful and the Servant [of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 53</a>], free of sin.”<sup>4</sup></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>Some, therefore, argue that the Servant represents a ‘righteous elite’ in Israel that suffered on behalf of the sinful Jews.<sup>5 </sup>But Isaiah never spoke of any such elite. On the contrary, he prophesied that the <em>whole nation </em>would be sinful! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:5-23:1:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 59:1-4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:11-27:9:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Daniel 9:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:18-27:9:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.) Besides, during periods of affliction, Jews suffered whether they were righteous or not.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Another problem: For whom did the Servant suffer? The Jewish <em>Soncino </em>commentary suggests the Babylonians. If so, who confessed that the Servant suffered ‘because of <em>our </em>iniquities’? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:5</a>) Is it reasonable to believe that the Babylonians (or any other Gentiles) would make such an astounding admission​—that the Jews suffered in <em>their </em>behalf?<sup>6</sup></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Interestingly, some first-century rabbis (and a number since then) identified the Suffering Servant with the Messiah.<sup>7 </sup>(See box on page 11.) Thousands of Jews came to see undeniable parallels between the Suffering Servant and Jesus of Nazareth. Like that Servant, Jesus was of humble origin. Ultimately, he was despised and shunned. Though he carried out no political conquest, he bore the diseases of others, miraculously curing their ailments. Though innocent, he died as a result of judicial miscarriage​—a fate he accepted without protest.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>A Dying Messiah?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Why would Messiah have to die? Explains <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:10</a>: “But the L<span class="altsize">ORD </span>chose to crush him by disease, that, if he made himself an offering for guilt, he might see offspring and have long life, and that through him the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>’s purpose might prosper.” (<em>Ta</em>) This alluded to the Levitical practice of offering up animal victims to atone for sin or guilt. Messiah would suffer a disgraceful death, but like a sacrificial victim, his death would have atoning merit.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">If Messiah died, though, how could he fulfill the prophecies about his glorious rule, much less “see offspring and have long life”? Logically, by a resurrection from the dead. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:17-11:17:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>.) Messiah’s resurrection would also resolve the seeming contradiction between <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13</a>, which predicted that the Messiah would triumphantly come on the clouds of heaven, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which said that he would humbly arrive on an ass. The Talmud tried to explain this paradox by asserting: “If they are meritorious, he will come with the clouds of heaven; if not, lowly and riding upon an ass.” (Sanhedrin 98a)<sup>8 </sup>This would mean that the prophecy at either <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13</a> or <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a> would remain <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>unfulfilled. Yet, Messiah’s resurrection would allow him to fulfill both prophecies. Initially, he would come humbly to suffer and die. After his resurrection, he would return in glory and usher in the heavenly Messianic rule.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Hundreds of Jewish eyewitnesses testified that Jesus experienced a resurrection from the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:6-46:15:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) Can such claims be brushed aside?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Judaism and Jesus</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Most first-century Jews rejected Jesus as Messiah. Still, he had a profound impact upon Judaism. Though Jesus is barely mentioned in the Talmud, what little is said tries “to belittle the person of Jesus by ascribing to him illegitimate birth, magic, and a shameful death.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<em>The Jewish Encyclopedia.</em><sup>9</sup></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jewish scholar Joseph Klausner admits that these tales “seem as though they are deliberately intended to contradict events recorded in the Gospels.”<sup>11 </sup>And with good reason! The Catholic Church had exacerbated Jewish aversion to Jesus by its anti-Semitism. It further alienated Jews by declaring Jesus to be a supposed ‘God the Son’​—part of an incomprehensible Trinity—​in direct contradiction to Jesus’ own teachings. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mark 12:29</a>, Jesus quoted the Torah, saying: “Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.”​—<em>King James Version; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Though Judaism resisted conversion, “Christianity affected Judaism considerably. It forced the Rabbis to change their emphasis and in some instances to alter their views.”<sup>12 </sup>Rabbis of earlier generations believed that the Messianic hope permeated the Scriptures. They saw glimmers of that hope in such Bible texts as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ge 49:10</a>. The Palestinian Targum applied the fulfillment of the former verse <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ge 3:15</a> to “the day of King Messiah.”<sup>13 </sup>The <em>Midrash Rabbah </em>said of the latter verse <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ge 49:10</a>: “This alludes to the royal Messiah.”<sup>14 </sup>The Talmud also applied prophecies of Isaiah, Daniel, and Zechariah to the Messiah.<sup>15 </sup>“All the prophets have prophesied only for the days of the Messiah,” Talmud, Sanhedrin 99a.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">But under the pressure of Christendom’s conversion efforts, Judaism reassessed its <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>views. Many Scripture texts that had long been applied to the Messiah were reinterpreted.<sup>17 </sup>As modern times dawned, under the influence of higher criticism of the Bible, some Jewish scholars concluded that the Messianic hope does not appear in the Bible at all!<sup>18</sup></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Messianic hope, however, underwent something of a rebirth with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Writes Harold Ticktin: ‘Most Jewish factions regard the emergence of the State of Israel as a great prophetic event.’<sup>19 </sup>Nevertheless, the issue of <em>when </em>the long-awaited Messiah is to arrive has remained unresolved in Jewish thought. The Talmud says: “When thou seest a generation overwhelmed by many troubles as by a river, await [the Messiah].” (Sanhedrin 98a)<sup>20</sup> However, the Jewish Messiah did not come during the dark night of the Holocaust nor during the tumultuous birth of the State of Israel. One wonders, ‘What further troubles must the Jewish people yet undergo before the Messiah will come?’</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>Seeking the Messiah</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Messianic hope was born and nurtured with the Jews. Among them that hope has grown dim. Its brilliance has been nearly extinguished by centuries of suffering and disappointment. Ironically, millions among the nations, or Gentiles, have come to seek and ultimately to embrace a Messiah. Is it just a coincidence that Isaiah said of the Messiah: “Unto him shall the nations [Gentiles] seek”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:10-23:11:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:10</a>, <em>JP</em>) Should not Jews also seek the Messiah themselves? Why should they deny themselves their long-cherished hope?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">It is in vain, however, to seek a future Messiah. Were he to arrive, how could he establish himself as a bona fide descendant of King David? Were not genealogical records destroyed along with the second temple? Though such records existed in Jesus’ day, his claim of being a legitimate descendant of David was never successfully challenged.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Could any future Messianic claimant ever produce <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>such credentials? One must therefore seek the Messiah who came in the past.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">This requires taking a fresh look at Jesus, dispensing with preconceived notions. The effeminate ascetic of church paintings bears little resemblance to the real Jesus. The Gospel accounts​—written by Jews—​show him as a powerful, vibrant man, a rabbi of extraordinary wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:2-43:3:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 3:2</a>) Actually, Jesus surpasses any dream the Jews ever had of a political deliverer. As a conquering King, he will usher in, not some fragile political state, but an invincible heavenly Kingdom that will restore Paradise to the entire earth and under which “the wolf shall dwell with the lamb.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6</a>, <em>JP; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Will you live in that Messianic age? Maimonides advised Jews simply to ‘wait for Messiah’s coming.’<sup>22 </sup>Our times are too critical, however, to risk having missed his return. The whole human race sorely needs a Messiah, a deliverer from the problems that plague this planet. It is therefore time to seek him​—intensely, actively. Jehovah’s Witnesses are eager to help you to do so. Remember, seeking the Messiah is no betrayal of one’s Jewish heritage, since the Messianic hope is intrinsic to Judaism. And by seeking the Messiah, you may well find that he has already come.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Historians say that 1914 was a turning point in history. Yet, the Bible long before had foretold that it would be. What does the Bible say regarding 1914? How have you been affected by what occurred then?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Intriguing answers are provided in the book <em>True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? </em>See the heading “The Marked Year​—1914 C.E.,” on page 70. This book, which was revised in 1986, has thus far reached a remarkable circulation of over 42 million copies in 70 languages.</p>

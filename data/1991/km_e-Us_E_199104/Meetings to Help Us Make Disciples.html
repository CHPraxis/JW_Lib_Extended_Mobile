Have a well-prepared publisher make the following presentation. “Hello. My name is ______. I’m making a brief call because I would like to ask you a question. Do you think that lasting peace will come in our lifetime? [Allow for a reply.] If we are to judge by the past, there is not much basis for hope. But notice what was prophesied for our time in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:1-42:21:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21</a>. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21 verses 10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:26-42:21:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 26</a>.] These conditions have prevailed since World War I. However, we are not left without hope. The very conditions that are so disturbing to mankind give evidence that God’s Kingdom will soon cleanse the earth and bring in lasting peace. This is what Jesus goes on to say in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21 verses 28 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>. [Read texts.] So these woeful and discouraging conditions are actually evidence that a wonderful change will soon take place. Isn’t that good news? [Allow for a reply.] This article in <em>The Watchtower </em>[select appropriate paragraph or illustration] shows some of the changes that will soon come and how you and your family may live to enjoy them. If you would like to read this information, I would be pleased to leave the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines with you.” Depending on the interest shown, publisher can determine if subscription should be offered. Generally, this is best done on a return visit after determining whether the householder has read the initial copies that were placed with him. Also, publisher may mention the number of languages in which magazines are published and the global extent of our activity. Our voluntary efforts serve to promote Bible education. As opportunity permits and it is appropriate, briefly explain to householder how worldwide work is carried on and that it is supported by voluntary donations. Conclude this part by encouraging all to use the new Topic for Conversation.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The idea of responsibility seems to burden people today. Many try to shirk it. As a result, husbands abandon wives, mothers forsake children, youths drop out of school, and citizens evade taxes. The list of irresponsible actions goes on and on. A responsible person is one who is trustworthy, willing and able to answer for his conduct. Therefore, God’s Word clearly states of Christians that “each one will carry his own load.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) How appropriate that the circuit assembly theme for the 1992 service year is “Carrying Our Own Load of Responsibility”! This series will begin in September. All of us should make definite plans to attend.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>By means of talks, skits, demonstrations, experiences, and interviews, this fine circuit assembly program will clearly outline the various responsibilities all of us have as Christians. On Saturday afternoon, a four-part symposium will be featured that explains how we can all joyfully care for our responsibilities. Our young people have a responsibility to bear, and the Saturday afternoon talk by the circuit overseer will be especially directed to them. On Saturday there will also be an opportunity for newly dedicated ones to be baptized. All of those planning to be baptized at the circuit assembly should let the presiding overseer know well in advance so that preparation can be made for this.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>On Sunday morning another four-part symposium will focus in on our Christian responsibility to preach. Then, on Sunday afternoon, the public talk entitled “God’s New World​—<span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Who Will Qualify to Enter?” will be given by the district overseer. Be alert to invite all newly interested ones to hear this talk.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>All of us will want to arrange our affairs to be in attendance and benefit fully from this splendid two-day program. Your circuit overseer will inform you of the location and the dates that are scheduled for your congregation.</p>

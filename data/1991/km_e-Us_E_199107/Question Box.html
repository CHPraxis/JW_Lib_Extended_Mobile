<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>‚óè Since we want to use our literature wisely, what adjustments might we make in offering literature in street witnessing?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In doing street witnessing, it is appropriate to approach people with the magazines or publications in our hand. Our goal should be to try to have a conversation with people. In that way we can determine whether the person contacted is interested and will agree to read our magazines. If it is possible to discuss briefly one of the articles in a magazine, that would be ideal. It may also be possible to explain that our work is done by volunteers and is not a commercial business, but that it is a worldwide activity supported through voluntary contributions. In some instances, a publisher may have to walk along with the person while conversing about the contents and benefits of the magazine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, we should be discerning and considerate. Many of those we meet on the streets may be in such a rush that it would be hard for us to detect their interest. In such cases, it may be better simply to offer a tract to whet their appetite for more of our literature when they meet us again and can pause for a discussion.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By being consistent in doing street work at certain locations and times, people will get acquainted with us and may be happy to discuss matters when they have opportunity, thereby giving us enough time to determine their interest.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We want to use our literature wisely. Therefore, we should endeavor to choose an appropriate time to offer literature. Our doing so will enable us to arrange to follow through on the interest and have time to explain the nature of our work.</p>

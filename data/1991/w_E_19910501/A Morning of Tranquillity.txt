A Morning of Tranquillity
That is what a reader in Illinois, U.S.A., said that the Awake! magazine provided. “I was pleasantly surprised after reading a copy of your Awake! publication,” the person wrote. “The magazine was passed on to me by a woman at my train station this morning. It made me feel relaxed and peaceful, and it was very informative. Please let me know how I can obtain copies of the publication on a regular basis.
“Thank you again for allowing me at least one morning of tranquillity.”
We feel that you too will benefit from the fascinating articles in Awake! If you would like to receive this magazine, simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to have the Awake! magazine sent to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

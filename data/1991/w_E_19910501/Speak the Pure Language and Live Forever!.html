<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 1. (a) What methods do students use to learn a foreign language? (b) Why speak the pure language?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">STUDENTS may learn a new tongue by using the grammar method or the spoken-language method. Under the grammar method, they generally use textbooks and learn grammatical rules. Under the spoken-language method, they imitate the sounds and word patterns spoken by their teacher. Both methods are used in learning the “pure language.” And it is vital that we speak this language if we hope to be “concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:1-36:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:8-36:3:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 2. How can we learn what might be called the rules of grammar for the pure language?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The principal textbook used to learn the pure language is the Bible. Diligent study of it and of Bible-based publications teach you what might be called the rules of grammar for the pure language. A home Bible study conducted by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a good start. For those already dedicated to God, regular and diligent study of the Scriptures is essential. But are there especially effective ways to learn the pure language? And what benefits result from speaking it?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>How to Learn the Pure Language</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 3. What is one way to learn the pure language?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>One way to learn the pure language is to associate truths you are learning with points you already know, as a language student might progressively relate various grammatical rules. For example, at one time you may have known that Jesus Christ is God’s Son, but you knew little about his duties. Since then, study of the Bible may have taught you that Christ now rules as a heavenly King and that during his Thousand Year Reign, obedient mankind will be uplifted to perfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:5-66:20:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 20:5, 6</a>) Yes, associating new thoughts with those already known improves your grasp of the pure language.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 4. (a) What is another way to learn the ‘grammatical rules’ of the pure language, and what Bible account is used to illustrate this? (b) What happened as Gideon and his three hundred men took action? (c) The account about Gideon teaches what lesson?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Another way to learn the ‘grammatical rules’ of the pure language is to visualize Biblical events. To illustrate: Try to ‘see and hear’ the account recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:15-7:7:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 7:15-23</a>. Look! Israelite judge Gideon has divided his forces into three companies of a hundred men each. In the darkness, they quietly descend from Mount Gilboa and surround the camp of sleeping Midianites. Are they well armed, these three hundred? Not militarily. Why, they would draw scornful laughter from haughty militarists! Each man has only a horn, a large water <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>jar, and a torch within the jar. But listen! At a given signal, the hundred men with Gideon blow their horns and smash their water jars. So do the two hundred others. As all raise flaming torches aloft, you hear them shout: “Jehovah’s sword and Gideon’s!” How this terrorizes the Midianites! They stumble out of their tents, their sleep-filled eyes widen in fright at the leaping flames that highlight shadowy shapes and ignite superstitious fear. As the Midianites begin to flee, Gideon’s men continue to blow their horns, and God sets their foes against one another. What a powerful lesson in the pure language! God can deliver his servants without a human military force. Moreover, “Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:22-9:12:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5. How can Christian meetings help to refine our speech?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>When students are taught a foreign tongue through the spoken-language method, they try to repeat the teacher’s sounds and word patterns correctly. What fine opportunities there are to speak the pure language at Christian meetings! There we hear others express themselves in that language of Scriptural truth, and we may be privileged to comment ourselves. Are we afraid that we may say something wrong? Let that not be our prime concern, for an error kindly corrected by the elder presiding at such a meeting as the weekly <em>Watchtower </em>Study can refine our speech. Therefore, attend and participate in Christian meetings regularly.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. Why is there such a contrast between Jehovah’s Witnesses and the religious organizations of Christendom?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Those who declare Jehovah’s purpose and announce his heavenly Kingdom speak the pure language as his Witnesses. They make known his name and serve him “shoulder to shoulder,” or with one consent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:9</a>) Though Christendom’s religions have the Bible, they do not speak the pure language or call upon God’s name in faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:32-29:2:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joel 2:32</a>) They have no harmonious message based on the Scriptures. Why? Because they place religious traditions, worldly philosophies, and political loyalties above God’s <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>Word. Their purposes, hopes, and methods are of this wicked world.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. What differences between Jehovah’s Witnesses and false religions are indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:4-62:4:6" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 John 4:4-6</a>?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Christendom​—in fact, the entire world empire of false religion—​does not speak the same language as Jehovah’s Witnesses do. Interestingly, to those speaking the pure language, the apostle John wrote: “You originate with God, . . . and you have conquered those persons, because he that is in union with you is greater than he that is in union with the world. They originate with the world; that is why they speak what proceeds from the world and the world listens to them. We originate with God. He that gains the knowledge of God listens to us; he that does not originate with God does not listen to us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:4-62:4:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 4:4-6</a>) Jehovah’s servants have conquered false teachers because God, who is in union with his people, “is greater than [the Devil, who] is in union with the world,” unrighteous human society. Since apostates “originate with the world” and have its wicked spirit, “they speak what proceeds from the world and the world listens to them.” But sheeplike individuals listen to those originating with God, realizing that Jehovah’s people speak the pure language of Bible truth provided through his organization.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. What is the identity of the man of lawlessness?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>A great apostasy was foretold, and a ‘mystery of lawlessness’ was already at work in the first century C.E. In time, men who accepted​—or seized—​teaching positions in the congregation taught many false doctrines. Their language was far from pure. So there arose a composite “man of lawlessness,” the clergy of Christendom, bound to false religious traditions, worldly philosophy, and unscriptural teachings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:3-53:2:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:7-53:2:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. What religious developments were there during the 19th century?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Only a small minority of God-fearing people ‘put up a hard fight for the faith delivered to the holy ones.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:3-65:1:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jude 3</a>) Where could such believers be found? For centuries, false religion kept the multitudes in spiritual darkness, but God knew those few who had his approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:19</a>) And then, amid the commercial, industrial, and social changes of the 19th century, there arose voices that stood out from the general babel of false religious confusion. Small groups tried to read the signs of the times and predict Jesus’ second coming, but not all spoke the pure language.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10. Which “second coming” group did God choose to speak the pure language, and why is it evident that the hand of Jehovah has been with them?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In 1879, however, it became clear which “second coming” voice was being chosen by Jehovah to speak the pure language as his Witnesses. By then a small Bible-study group led by Charles Taze Russell was meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. They had become certain that Jesus’ second coming would begin his invisible presence, that a time of world distress was ahead, and that this would be followed by the Thousand Year Reign of Christ that would restore Paradise on earth, with eternal life for obedient humans. In July 1879 these Bible Students began to publish the magazine now known as <em>The Watchtower. </em>Only 6,000 copies were distributed of the first issue. But “the hand of Jehovah” was with those Witnesses, for this journal is now published in 111 languages, with an average printing of over 15,000,000 for each issue.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:19-44:11:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 11:19-21</a>.</p>

And what grand benefits are enjoyed by those speaking it! Instead of saying that ‘God is God, Christ is God, and the Holy Ghost is God’ in the mysterious lingo of Trinitarianism, they agree with the Bible’s position that Jehovah is the Most High, Jesus Christ as a lesser one is His Son, and the holy spirit is God’s amazing active force.

To illustrate: Years ago, some of us learned a foreign language. We may recall some words in that tongue but have likely lost our command of it because we have not put it to constant use. The same thing can happen with the pure language. If we do not use it regularly, we can lose our command of it, and that would have tragic consequences spiritually. Let us therefore speak it regularly at meetings and in the Christian ministry. These activities, coupled with personal study, will enable us to say things correctly in the pure language.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Speech can be lifesaving or death dealing. This was shown during a conflict between the Israelite tribe of Ephraim and Judge Jephthah of Gilead. To identify Ephraimites trying to flee across the Jordan River, the Gileadites used the password “Shibboleth,” which had an initial “sh” sound. The men of Ephraim betrayed themselves to the Gileadite sentries at the fords of the Jordan by saying “Sibboleth” instead of “Shibboleth,” mispronouncing the opening sound of the word.

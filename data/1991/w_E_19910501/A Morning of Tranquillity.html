<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a reader in Illinois, U.S.A., said that the <em>Awake! </em>magazine provided. “I was pleasantly surprised after reading a copy of your <em>Awake! </em>publication,” the person wrote. “The magazine was passed on to me by a woman at my train station this morning. It made me feel relaxed and peaceful, and it was very informative. Please let me know how I can obtain copies of the publication on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Thank you again for allowing me at least one morning of tranquillity.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We feel that you too will benefit from the fascinating articles in <em>Awake! </em>If you would like to receive this magazine, simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to have the <em>Awake! </em>magazine sent to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

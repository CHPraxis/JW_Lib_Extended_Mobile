<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“My parents are Italian Catholics who would never pick up the <em>Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>magazine to read,” wrote a woman from Westerly, Rhode Island, U.S.A. But now, she says, <em>The Watchtower </em>has opened her father’s heart. She explains how this came about:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One day I borrowed my father’s truck, which had a tape deck that he never used. So I took advantage of it. I put in a cassette of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. When I returned the truck, I didn’t take the cassette out. In the meantime, my father took the truck and began to listen to the cassette.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“My father is very comical​—he thought the Witnesses were on the radio, and he kept changing the station but kept hearing about the Witnesses. Finally, after two days, he realized it was a cassette and not the radio. But by then he was hooked by what he had listened to.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“That my father had learned things became obvious when he and my mother began telling me things he had been listening to. Every other day on my way out in the ministry, I would switch the cassette in his truck. And every morning when I would see him at breakfast, he would ask me questions such as: ‘Is your husband an elder?’ or, ‘The Bible doesn’t teach purgatory or hellfire, does it?’ So he’s gradually learning the Bible.”</p>

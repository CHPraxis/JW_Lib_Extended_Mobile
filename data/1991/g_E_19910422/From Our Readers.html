<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Afterschool Jobs  </strong>I really enjoyed the articles on afterschool jobs. (November 22 and December 8, 1990) Although I am not ready for a job, your articles showed the importance of saving money for the future. They also helped me to see that if I get a job, I will need a schedule that includes time for spiritual activities. I will remember these articles in the future.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">My goal has been to be a pioneer [full-time evangelizer]. I wondered if I should first get a job and save up money. The articles helped me see that doing so could make me fall into the trap of materialism. So I have decided to work​—work on building up my spiritual foundation—​so that I will be good and ready for the pioneer service.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Rain Forests  </strong>Your article about rain forests (March 22, 1990) was on a high scientific level. Everyone knows that the environment is deteriorating and that something should be done. But as a news correspondent here in Poland, I was wondering who would have the courage to write about the fundamental <em>reasons </em>for environmental negligence. You are the first ones to do so by pointing to egocentrism and desire for profit as the real reasons. Well done!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Bloody Films  </strong>A film I wanted to see, <em>Die Hard 2, </em>was mentioned in the “Watching the World” item “Bloody Films.” (December 22, 1990) I had even talked to my friends about going to see it. But when I read this item, I decided that watching this film would be like watching a horror movie and decided not to go. Actually, I still want to go, but for the sake of my own spiritual progress, I won’t.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Exercise  </strong>Thank you very much for the article “What Exercise Can Do for You.” (October 22, 1990) Every time we have physical education in school, we have to run one mile <strong>[1.6 km]</strong>, and I’ve always hated it! Your article showed me that exercise can really benefit people.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Thank you for your article. In September, because of having a regular exercise program, I was able to stop taking medication for high blood pressure. After nine weeks of bouncing on a minitrampoline, I told my doctor that I wanted to try coming off my medication. She instructed me on how to cut back gradually on the dosage. Now my blood pressure is normal, I feel great, and my husband is bouncing away trying to lower his!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>Readers should note that if they have had significant health problems, or if they are older, they would be wise to consult a qualified health practitioner before beginning a vigorous exercise program. Consultation with such a health practitioner would also be wise when making any decision regarding prescribed medications.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Home Vacations  </strong>Your article “Why Not Try a Vacation at Home?” (June 22, 1990) suggested collecting wildflowers. While I used to do so years ago, I have since learned the outdoor rule: ‘Take nothing but pictures; leave nothing but footprints.’ Where I live, it is against the law to pick certain wildflowers. But a well-exposed, sharply focused picture of a wildflower can be enjoyed for years!</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>Taking photos is indeed a practical way to enjoy nature in areas where picking flowers, or similar activities, is against the law or could cause ecological damage. Thanks for the suggestion.​—ED.</em></p>

Highlight <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 10:11</a>. Finding people at home is an increasing problem and can have a definite effect on our productiveness and joy. What can be done? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:201985203/6:174-11$p/E:201985208/1-8$p/E:201985209/1-11$p/E:201985210/1-10"><em>km </em>6/85 p. 4</a>) Approach people in their yards. Keep record of those not at home and call back promptly. Some have had excellent success finding such persons home in the evenings, so participate in evening witnessing. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:201987203/6:28-11$p/E:201987207/4:137-6$p/E:201987210/1-12$p/E:201987211/1-6"><em>km </em>6/87 p. 4</a>) Street witnessing can be effective. When interested persons are met on street, obtain name and address. Make arrangements to call at their homes. (Briefly interview two or three publishers and/​or pioneers who have had success in evening or street witnessing.) Satan will use every means possible to keep us from finding deserving ones. We must search for them. The “sheep” belong to Jesus Christ. He has commanded us to find and feed them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 21:15-17</a>) This helps us to appreciate need to reach the occupants of every home if possible.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Benefiting From the Life Stories of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Discussion by two brothers. Periodically, the life stories of modern-day servants of God appear in <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>They are listed in <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>by both name and title of article. (Illustrate how to find specific articles.) It is important that we carefully read these articles and draw strength and encouragement from them. Use information to encourage our brothers and Bible students. Briefly review article “What a Joy to Sit at Jehovah’s Table!” from <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1991567/1-40"><em>The Watchtower, </em>August 1, 1991, pages 25-9</a>. Highlight specific points from article that help us (a) in our field ministry, (b) to endure trials, (c) to appreciate Jehovah and his organization better, and (d) to appreciate the worldwide brotherhood. We greatly benefit from being “imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 6:11, 12</a>.</p>

Question Box
▪ Should publishers and pioneers feel obligated to contribute to the Society’s worldwide work each time they obtain literature for field service at the Kingdom Hall?
No. As stated in the April 21, 1990, letter to all congregations in the United States: “Publishers may . . . make their own donations to support the worldwide work according to their ability and desire, whenever they choose to do so.​—2 Cor. 8:10-15; 9:6-14.”
However, some publishers have chosen to make their donations at the time they pick up a literature supply. They do this because picking up literature serves as a convenient reminder of their privilege and responsibility to support the worldwide work regularly. Others contribute personally at the same time they put in the voluntary donations received from interested ones met in the field ministry. Many have decided to make a specific donation each week. Still others set aside an amount for the worldwide work each month, just as they do for Kingdom Hall expenses.
Whenever it is done, each one has to determine what he or she can personally do in support of the worldwide work. Such giving should be done in an orderly way in accord with how the giver is prospering. (1 Cor. 16:2) When we make such donations, we must have in mind that we are contributing not simply to cover the cost of producing the literature but rather to support all facets of the worldwide work.

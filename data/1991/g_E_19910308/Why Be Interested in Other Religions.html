<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Most people know only the religion of their parents and that often only superficially. Should your religion be determined by the geographical accident of your birth-place? Or should you make an intelligent choice by comparing your religion with others?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In their search for God, men and women have turned in many directions. Thus, the diversity of religions​—Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Shinto, Taoism, Christianity. Do you know how they differ? In what ways they are similar? The 384-page book <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>will answer many of your questions. It may also lead you to the true God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I would like to receive the 384-page color-illustrated textbook <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 5.)</p>

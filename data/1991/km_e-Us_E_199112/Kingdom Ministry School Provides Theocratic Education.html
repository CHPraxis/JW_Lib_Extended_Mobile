<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Elders carry a heavy load of responsibility. Beginning in 1959, arrangements were made for a “special training course in overseers’ activity” to help them care for this weighty assignment. (<em>jp </em>pp. 292-3; <a class="xt" data-xtid="56" href="jwpub://p/E:301977001/34:102-39:92"><em>yb77 </em>p. 14</a>) Ministerial servants were invited to attend for the first time in 1984. The last Kingdom Ministry School was held during the 1988 service year, and tens of thousands benefited.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since then, hundreds of congregations have been formed and thousands of brothers have been appointed as elders and ministerial servants. Also, organizational adjustments have been made. Therefore, the Governing Body arranged for all congregation elders and ministerial servants to attend the Kingdom Ministry School during this service year. The new course has been tailored to meet the current needs in the field. Bethel representatives and some of the traveling overseers will take the lead in teaching at the school. Benefits to all congregations will be realized as the elders and ministerial servants apply what they learn from the school.</p>

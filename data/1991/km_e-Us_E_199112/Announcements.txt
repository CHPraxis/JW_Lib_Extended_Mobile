Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. January and February: Any 192-page book published in 1983 or earlier. If the congregation has no stock of such books to be offered, the book Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace” should be offered and may be requested from Brooklyn. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.
▪ The Society has a small supply of past issues of The Watchtower and Awake! on cassette. Anyone desiring a particular issue may request it through the congregation. Please be sure to specify the issue date.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1991 on their December literature request. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 6-8, 10.) The bound volumes will be available in Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.​—See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 24 and 25.
▪ The Memorial for 1993 will be Tuesday, April 6, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1993 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are too many congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.

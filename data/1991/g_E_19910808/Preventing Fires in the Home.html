<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AS THE story goes, Mrs. Patrick O’Leary’s cow kicked over the kerosene lamp in the barn and started the great Chicago fire of 1871. The cost in property damage and life was staggering. According to one source, the fire left 100,000 homeless, destroyed over 17,400 buildings, and killed 250 people.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, 120 years later, modern fire-fighting technology has helped prevent many large-scale fires. However, house fires continue to pose a dangerous threat. The NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) claims that in the United States, almost five thousand people were killed in house fires in one year. As recorded in <em>The Vancouver Sun, </em>NFPA gave a few simple hints to help keep the house fires out. They are, in essence:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">□ Do not allow tobacco smoking in the house. Accidents involving careless smokers continue to be the leading cause of death from fires in the home.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">□ Do not leave portable heaters operating unattended or while you sleep.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">□ Do not overload electrical circuitry or use frayed cords. Use only the proper size fuses.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">□ Keep furnaces and chimneys clean. Inspect them annually.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">□ Check smoke detectors regularly, and replace batteries every year. Be sure all in the family recognize the sound of the smoke detector.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">□ Check that all in the family know the fire escape route, and keep exits clear.</p>

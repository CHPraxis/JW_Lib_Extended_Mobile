“A Worldwide Family Reunion”
Imagine having friends and family in 212 countries. Impossible? No, a reality. Jehovah’s Witnesses are a worldwide brotherhood of Christians. They worship Jehovah God and share the good news of his Kingdom by Christ Jesus with all who will listen.
Read the exciting reports about their activity in the 1991 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. One reader wrote: “I look forward to getting the Yearbook each year. It’s like attending a worldwide family reunion when I read the many wonderful experiences and comments of friends.”
The 1991 Yearbook features the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Hawaii, Sweden, and Thailand. In addition, it provides an up-to-date picture of the work that Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing worldwide. If you would like to receive this 256-page book, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the 1991 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

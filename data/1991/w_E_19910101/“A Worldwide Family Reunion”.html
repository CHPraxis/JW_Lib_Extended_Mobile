<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Imagine having friends and family in 212 countries. Impossible? No, a reality. Jehovah’s Witnesses are a worldwide brotherhood of Christians. They worship Jehovah God and share the good news of his Kingdom by Christ Jesus with all who will listen.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Read the exciting reports about their activity in the <em>1991 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>One reader wrote: “I look forward to getting the <em>Yearbook </em>each year. It’s like attending a worldwide family reunion when I read the many wonderful experiences and comments of friends.”</p>

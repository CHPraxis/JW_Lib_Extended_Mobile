Their Faith in Evolution Was Shaken
A man from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A., wrote last year to express appreciation “for the wonderful tool that was provided in the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?” He explained:
“About two years ago, I met a young couple from Beijing, China, who were attending a medical college here in Milwaukee. They are biochemists, and they made no secret about their sincere belief in evolution.
“I was surely at a disadvantage in trying to speak with them on a scientific level, so I decided to let the book do the teaching. As we went along in our study, I could see their confidence in evolution begin to waver.”
A study of the entire book was completed, and the man from Milwaukee concludes: “The Bible has become to them the true source of information. Thanks again for that marvelous tool.”

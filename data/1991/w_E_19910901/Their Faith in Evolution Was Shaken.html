<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A., wrote last year to express appreciation “for the wonderful tool that was provided in the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?” </em>He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“About two years ago, I met a young couple from Beijing, China, who were attending a medical college here in Milwaukee. They are biochemists, and they made no secret about their sincere belief in evolution.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I was surely at a disadvantage in trying to speak with them on a scientific level, so I decided to let the book do the teaching. As we went along in our study, I could see their confidence in evolution begin to waver.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A study of the entire book was completed, and the man from Milwaukee concludes: “The Bible has become to them the true source of information. Thanks again for that marvelous tool.”</p>

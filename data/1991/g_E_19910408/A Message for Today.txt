A Message for Today
The Watchtower contains such a message, as noted by a reader who recently requested a subscription. She wrote: “I have been reading your magazine with great interest. I had a chance to read the scriptures in the different articles during my leisure time.
“I am always amazed at the message of your magazine in light of today’s news. It can’t be emphasized enough how necessary your publications are for a better understanding of the Bible. Your magazine was the reason why I decided to get out my dusty Bible and look into the Book of books. I really look forward to each issue.”

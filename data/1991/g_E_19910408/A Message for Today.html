<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>The Watchtower </strong>contains such a message, as noted by a reader who recently requested a subscription. She wrote: “I have been reading your magazine with great interest. I had a chance to read the scriptures in the different articles during my leisure time.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am always amazed at the message of your magazine in light of today’s news. It can’t be emphasized enough how necessary your publications are for a better understanding of the Bible. Your magazine was the reason why I decided to get out my dusty Bible and look into the Book of books. I really look forward to each issue.”</p>

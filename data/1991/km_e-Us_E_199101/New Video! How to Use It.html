<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>On Monday evening, October 8, the United States and Canada Bethel families saw it, and they were excited by the prospects for its use. A Bethel couple called it “one of the most encouraging and enjoyable things we have ever seen.” After viewing this new 55-minute video entitled <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—The Organization Behind the Name</em>, we feel that you too will be elated by the informative, beautiful presentation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The video shows the organization of Jehovah’s devoted people fulfilling Jesus’ command to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) While activities at Brooklyn Bethel and Watchtower Farms are highlighted, a fine scope of the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is presented. Shortly, those who requested the video through the congregation will be receiving their personal copy. You will note that this is copyrighted material and is not to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>After viewing the program, you will undoubtedly begin thinking of others you will want to share it with. But whom in particular? It is especially designed to show on home Bible studies where good progress is being made. We recommend that you view it with the student, since it will provide a basis for future discussions with him. If desired, this video can be lent to the student to show to others, or he may obtain a personal copy.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Do you have unbelieving relatives? Why not arrange for them to see it? This may prove to be just what is needed to stimulate a discussion about our organization and beliefs. The program should particularly benefit young ones. As a result of seeing so many other youths devoting themselves to advancing Kingdom interests, they may be encouraged to pursue the full-time ministry also.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>We are confident that this new video will enhance the appreciation of many more people for Jehovah’s organization and what it is accomplishing worldwide.</p>

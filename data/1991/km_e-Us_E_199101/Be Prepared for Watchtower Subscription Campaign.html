<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In anticipation of an outstanding <em>Watchtower </em>subscription campaign during April and May, the Society is preparing special-interest issues of both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Feature articles will address a variety of subjects prominently on the minds of people everywhere.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>The Watchtower </em>will discuss the following subjects: “Is It Later Than You Think?” (April 1), “When Will Peace Really Come?” (April 15), “Coping With Crime in a Chaotic World” (May 1), and “Put God First in Your Family Life!” (May 15). <em>Awake! </em>articles will deal with these subjects: “When Man and Animals Live in Peace” (April 8), “Help for the Children of Divorce” (April 22), “Lottery Fever​—Who Wins? Who Loses?” (May 8), and “Television​—The Box That Changed the World” (May 22).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">All publishers, especially the pioneers, should consider their individual needs for increased activity in offering subscriptions and distributing individual magazines. Be sure to request increased quantities of magazines in sufficient time to have an adequate supply from the very beginning of the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign.</p>

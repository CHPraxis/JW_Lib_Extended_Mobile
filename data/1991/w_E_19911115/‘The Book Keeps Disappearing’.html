<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a high-school teacher in southern California, U.S.A., says about the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>The school instituted a daily reading period during which students could read anything they liked. She put out literature, including the <em>Young People Ask </em>book, for students who brought nothing to read.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The book has become the most popular one in the class,” she explains. “It disappears for several hours at a time, or even for a day or two, then comes back. Students will ask their friends, ‘Have you read this?’ or comment, ‘That’s a good book.’ After pointing out things to their friends, they go back and read more.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Pages are turned down, and the book is showing signs of wear. The most worn chapter is number 23, ‘What About Sex Before Marriage?’ The students like the pictures, and they identify with the captions. I saw one student reading the chapter ‘Why Did Dad and Mom Split Up?’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“After a while the first book disappeared, so I put out another one. Then the first one came back, so now there are two. Three or four months have passed since I put the first book out, and these are still being read.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Other chapters among the 39 in the book are “How Can I Make Real Friends?” “How Important Are Looks?” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?” If you would like to receive a copy of this attractively illustrated book, please fill in and mail the coupon.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I would like to receive the 320-page hardbound book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

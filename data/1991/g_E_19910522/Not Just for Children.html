<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman from Fort Worth, Texas, writes: “I have had the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher </em>for a number of years. I decided to begin to read it to my ten-month-old son. Each day I read two or three chapters. I know that he is still a little too young to understand it. However, I have greatly benefited from it personally. The book touched my heart in a very special way and deepened my love and appreciation for Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ. I am 27 years old. I thought the <em>Great Teacher </em>book was just for children, and now I regret not looking into it earlier.”</p>

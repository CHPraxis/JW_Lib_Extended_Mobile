<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A person from Hayward, California, U.S.A., writes: “I am amazed, thrilled, and delighted with the above-named brochure. It is a masterly work of accumulating data from various religious sources, quoting admissions that the doctrine of the Trinity is false, misleading, and not supported by God’s Word, the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many have appreciated this scholarly, well-documented examination of this fundamental teaching of the churches of Christendom. If you would like to receive a copy of this brochure, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>

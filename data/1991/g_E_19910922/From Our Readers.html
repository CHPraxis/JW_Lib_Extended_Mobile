<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>TMJ Syndrome  </strong>Thank you for the article “Out Of the Jaws​—The Great Impostor.” (June 22, 1991) Until a little while ago, I was afflicted with this problem. I would wake up during the night, panic stricken because my jaw was stuck! Various doctors misdiagnosed my problem until I consulted a dental expert. He immediately discovered that it was caused by poorly aligned teeth. The suggestions given in the article are practical, useful, and can give immediate relief.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Bad Habits  </strong>Thank you for the help I found in the article “Preventing the Return of Bad Habits” (April 8, 1991) in overcoming TV addiction. Chapter 36 of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work </em>[published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.] helped for a while, but I fell back into heavy TV viewing again. Your article helped me substitute a bad habit with a good one, namely, reading the spiritual food that comes out in <em>Awake!</em></p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Children of Divorce  </strong>Heartfelt thanks for the series “Help for Children of Divorce.” (April 22, 1991) When I was three, my father divorced my mother. She did a fine job in bringing up my little sister and me to love Jehovah. But during the teenage years, it was just as you described. I felt that “all relationships are unreliable, doomed to unravel someday in betrayal and infidelity.” I was afraid to love and be loved, and even among fellow Christians, I kept all relationships on a superficial level. Learning to do things for other people and serving as a full-time evangelizer helped me overcome these tendencies to some extent. However, your article enabled me to understand some of my deepest feelings for the first time.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The articles made my husband and me feel guilty. My first mate was disfellowshipped from the Christian congregation for unfaithfulness. My boys and I then moved in with my parents, about 2,000 miles <strong>[3,200 km] </strong>away. The boys had little contact with their father. After I remarried, we continued to discourage any contact, feeling the father was a bad influence. Did we make the right decision?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Neither divorce nor expulsion from the Christian congregation ends a parent-child relationship; children continue to need both parents. Nevertheless, each situation is different. Physical distance or indifference on the part of an ex-spouse may greatly limit parent-child contact. On the other hand, the courts may impose visitation arrangements, and a Christian may have little choice but to cooperate. Where no visitation arrangements have been imposed, it is up to the custodial parent to determine if association with an ex-spouse would pose grave physical or spiritual dangers.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Thanks for the naked truth in your articles on divorce. My parents divorced when I was nearly 20 years old, and I went through a stage where I despised the very institution of marriage. I viewed it as a trap or a prison! Thanks to your Bible-enlightened books and magazines, I actually look forward to marriage someday, with its real potential in sight.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Colosseum  </strong>I found the article “The Colosseum​—Ancient Rome’s ‘Entertainment’ Center” (April 8, 1991) to be most engaging. As a historian, I thought it was inspiring the way you separated the truth from legend.</p>

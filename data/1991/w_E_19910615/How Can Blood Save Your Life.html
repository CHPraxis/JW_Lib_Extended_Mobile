<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Giving blood transfusions has been highly touted as a safe, lifesaving procedure. But Dr. Alan A. Waldman explains: “[The] relatively serene perception of the safety of blood products was dramatically transformed with the detection of transfusion-associated AIDS.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yet AIDS is not the only danger. “Several other developments have contributed to the feeling that there are unknown and uncontrolled dangers to the use of donated blood,” Dr. Waldman points out. “Now, even matters once regarded as settled​—for example, the effectiveness of testing for carriers of hepatitis B virus—​have been called into question.”​—<em>Diagnostics &amp; Clinical Testing, </em>July 1989.</p>

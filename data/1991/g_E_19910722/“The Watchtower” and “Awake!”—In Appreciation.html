<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A columnist writing in the Dutch newspaper <em>NRC Handelsblad </em>of July 24, 1990, had this to say regarding <em>Awake! </em>and its companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower:</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘Those who, like me, for two decades have considered the magazines <em>Awake! </em>and <em>The Watchtower </em>[published by Jehovah’s Witnesses] not worth a glance but have chanced upon them recently will be amazed. They have radically changed, both in format and in content.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">‘Formerly, in both periodicals, what struck one the most were the drawings: pictures in one color and on newsprint paper. The stories, if I rightly remember, were a sort of <em>Reader’s Digest </em>of the good news and touched only incidentally on difficult world problems, such as war, drugs, sex, and politics.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">‘That is completely changed now. Both periodicals are sort of miniature current-affairs commentaries. They are abundantly illustrated with color photographs . . . Now and then one may even admire a somewhat edifying <em>work of art </em>too, such as a reproduction of the apostles at the Last Supper (in <em>The Watchtower </em>of July 1, 1990), but whenever possible, photographs are used. It is noticeable that <em>Awake! </em>goes in a lot for science. In the July 8 issue, there is a piece about the lunar eclipse on August 16 last year, short notes on breast-feeding and on the link between osteoporosis and the level of manganese in the blood, and last but not least, a three-part feature article in which views for and against animal research are presented.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The writer makes this further observation: ‘With its circulation figure of 11,930,000 copies in 61 languages [now 12,980,000 copies in 64 languages], <em>Awake! </em>forms an inestimable source of scientific news for a very large reading public.’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Of course, <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>have ‘radically changed’ in appearance only​—not content. For decades now, both magazines have been presenting well-researched articles that point to God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. But it is hoped that the improved appearance of our magazines will result in more individuals <em>reading </em>our journals and benefiting from the life-giving message.</p>

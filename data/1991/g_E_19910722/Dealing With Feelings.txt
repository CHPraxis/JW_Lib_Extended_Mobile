Dealing With Feelings
To do so successfully is a real challenge. A youth tells her experience: “I was feeling happy, but the next minute I was in a deep depression. Sometimes I didn’t even know what I was feeling. It was as if I was completely lost in the dark. I couldn’t express myself and what my emotions were no matter who I talked to, not even to myself. I felt like I wasn’t getting attention from people around me, especially my schoolmates, because I wasn’t attractive enough. Eventually all these feelings were killing me inside, and I began hating myself and my personality.”
The girl had a copy of the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out Of It. “It was all very interesting,” she writes, “so I wanted to read the next chapter, ‘Moving Into Womanhood.’ I couldn’t believe what I was reading. The chapter exactly described how I’ve felt lately, plus it gave the answer. It was so encouraging to read that it was perfectly normal to feel this way. I just have to know the right way to handle it.”
Besides helping youths deal with their feelings, this book discusses such matters as drug abuse and answers the questions, Should youths drink alcoholic beverages? and, Should they have sex relations before marriage? If you would like to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.
I would like to receive the hardcover 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out Of It. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 5.)

“The Crème de la Crème”
That is what an English professor from a college in Georgia, U.S.A., said about the Awake! magazine. He wrote recently:
“I have been using Awake! magazines in my college composition courses for the past seven years, and I must say, your writers are the crème de la crème. The interest-arousing introductions and the vivid detail contained in many of the articles are excellent examples for beginning, intermediate, and advanced writers.
“The articles in Awake! not only are entertaining and informative but also are of the highest grammatical quality. I use them to cite proper use of punctuation, idiomatic expressions, figurative language, and diction. The exposure to new words the reader gets is indeed a challenging, yet refreshing, change from the average newsmagazine. The success of Awake! gives evidence of the quality time and attention put into each issue.”

I would like to have the Awake! magazine sent to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

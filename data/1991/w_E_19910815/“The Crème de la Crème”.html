<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what an English professor from a college in Georgia, U.S.A., said about the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. He wrote recently:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have been using <em>Awake! </em>magazines in my college composition courses for the past seven years, and I must say, your writers are the crème de la crème. The interest-arousing introductions and the vivid detail contained in many of the articles are excellent examples for beginning, intermediate, and advanced writers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The articles in <em>Awake! </em>not only are entertaining and informative but also are of the highest grammatical quality. I use them to cite proper use of punctuation, idiomatic expressions, figurative language, and diction. The exposure to new words the reader gets is indeed a challenging, yet refreshing, change from the average newsmagazine. The success of <em>Awake! </em>gives evidence of the quality time and attention put into each issue.”</p>

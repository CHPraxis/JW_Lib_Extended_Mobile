<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● When a publisher moves to another area, what should be done to assist in the transfer to a new congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As soon as a publisher arrives from another congregation, the congregation secretary should obtain from the publisher the name of his former congregation and the name and address of the secretary of that congregation. He should then write to the secretary of the former congregation, requesting the Congregation’s Publisher Record card and a letter of introduction. The secretary receiving this request should respond without delay.​—See <em>Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, </em>pages 104-5.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The publisher who plans to move can help by making sure that he has the correct name of the congregation he is leaving and the name and address of the secretary. Then, upon his arrival in the new congregation, this information can be given to the secretary there so that he can follow through promptly. Field service reports submitted to the new congregation can be held until the record card is received. Thereafter the publisher’s activity can be posted on the record card and included in the congregation’s next monthly report.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In some cases the publisher may already know the name and address of the secretary in the congregation to which he is moving. If so, there would be no need for the elders to wait for a request. The record of the publisher’s activity and a letter of introduction can be mailed immediately to the secretary of the congregation where the publisher will associate.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how a reader from Argentina defined the recently published book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>“It contains a variety of forms and elements, just like mosaic,” he wrote. “Just as a mosaic is an inlaid work of diverse elements, this book contains such a variety of subjects and explanations about religion that it surprises the reader.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Generally, Western observers are totally ignorant of Eastern beliefs and their origins.” Yet, as this appreciative reader notes, this book goes “from Hinduism to Zionism, to Buddhism and the sects of Christendom, and to innumerable other religious ideas. It is a mosaic of help,” he explains, “for anyone who is investigating religions.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most people know only the religion of their parents and that often only superficially. But should your religion be simply the one you were born into, or should you make an intelligent choice after comparing your religion with that of others? The 384-page book <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>will help you to make this comparison. It may also lead you closer to the true God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to receive the 384-page, color-illustrated textbook <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

“Why Do Babies Die?”
That is what a family who lost two small children wanted to know. A man from Willowick, Ohio, U.S.A., explained:
“Recently, a tragedy occurred within my family. My fleshly sister lost her two infant children in a terrible car accident. Of course, the entire family was devastated. Their Baptist minister offered nothing in the way of Scriptural comfort. He could only say, ‘It was God’s will’ and, ‘God needed two more angels.’
“Although there was very little time for research, I turned to the book Reasoning From the Scriptures and its topic ‘Why Do Babies Die?’ In the days and weeks that followed, my wife and I have been able to share with my family the truthful answers to many of their questions, such as, ‘Why do babies die?’ ‘Is it God’s will to take children from their parents?’ and, most important, ‘What hope is there to see these lovely children again?’ My parents have said they would like to come to the Kingdom Hall in the future.”
Reasoning From the Scriptures contains over 70 main subject headings. Included are “Death,” “Hell,” “Soul,” “Rapture,” “Reincarnation,” “Sex,” “Spiritism,” and many more. Its seven-page index of subjects and scriptures can help you to find answers quickly. To receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.
I would like to receive the hardcover 448-page handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

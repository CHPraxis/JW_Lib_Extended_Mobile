<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a family who lost two small children wanted to know. A man from Willowick, Ohio, U.S.A., explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Recently, a tragedy occurred within my family. My fleshly sister lost her two infant children in a terrible car accident. Of course, the entire family was devastated. Their Baptist minister offered nothing in the way of Scriptural comfort. He could only say, ‘It was God’s will’ and, ‘God needed two more angels.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Although there was very little time for research, I turned to the book <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures </em>and its topic ‘Why Do Babies Die?’ In the days and weeks that followed, my wife and I have been able to share with my family the truthful answers to many of their questions, such as, ‘Why do babies die?’ ‘Is it God’s will to take children from their parents?’ and, most important, ‘What hope is there to see these lovely children again?’ My parents have said they would like to come to the Kingdom Hall in the future.”</p>

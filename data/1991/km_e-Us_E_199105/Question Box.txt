Question Box
● Why is it recommended that publishers serve with the congregation that holds the territory where they live?
It is important to do things in an orderly and theocratic way. The apostle Paul wrote: “For God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace. . . . Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.”​—1 Cor. 14:33, 40.
While there may be some exceptions because of transportation difficulties, secular work schedules, or the need for assistance in oversight, generally it is best to attend the congregation in whose territory we live. This makes field service more convenient, and we do not have to travel so far to work with a group outside our neighborhood. It puts us in a better position to work with others in our congregation and to direct newly interested ones to the meetings most convenient to them. And it keeps us in close touch with other brothers and sisters in our area who can help us in time of need.
By working submissively within the arrangements made, we show that we are keeping Kingdom interests first. (Luke 16:10) When a new congregation is formed or Congregation Book Studies are rearranged, we may prefer to stay with certain friends. But by accepting the new arrangement, we can make new friends and widen out in our theocratic associations. Also, it is easier for the elders to shepherd the flock and improve the spiritual condition of the congregation when publishers live within the territory of the congregation with which they associate.

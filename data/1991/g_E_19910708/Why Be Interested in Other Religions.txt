Why Be Interested in Other Religions?
Most people know only the religion of their parents and that often only superficially. Should your religion be simply the one you were born into? Or should you make an intelligent choice by comparing your religion with that of others?
In their search for God, men and women have turned in many directions​—thus, the diversity of religions—​Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Shinto, Taoism, and Christianity. Do you know how they differ? In what ways they are similar? The 384-page book Mankind’s Search for God will answer many of your questions. It may also lead you to the true God.
I would like to receive the 384-page, color-illustrated textbook Mankind’s Search for God. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 5.)

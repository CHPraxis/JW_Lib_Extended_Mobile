“I Have Never Seen Such Organization”
“I have gone through different religions and sects,” writes a man from Mexico. “But I have never seen such organization.” The man had just finished reading the brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide. He explained: “What impresses me the most is the seriousness with which you fulfill the commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom from house to house, at work, on the street, in buses. It is marvelous to find people who take God’s will so seriously in this age of so much religious hypocrisy.”

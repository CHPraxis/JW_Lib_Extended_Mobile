<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>â–ª If a householder gives a comparatively generous donation, should we be moved to give him additional literature?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Not necessarily. You can use your good judgment in this regard, taking into consideration the interest manifested in reading the literature. On subsequent visits, literature that meets a particular need of the householder might be left. If the householder takes the initiative to offer a further donation, such can be graciously accepted. Keep in mind that donations support various facets of our worldwide work, which includes our building program, missionaries, and the special pioneer work, in addition to our publishing of literature.</p>

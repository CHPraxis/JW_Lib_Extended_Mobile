<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With its September issue, <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>appears with a new format. The improved design will simplify work procedures in producing this monthly publication in many languages and make it easier for readers to locate certain information.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With this new format, all titles and texts can be produced by computer, eliminating the need for manual stripping in of titles. This greatly simplifies the work in producing <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For the reader, there are several improvements. There is a uniformity of type sizes, and the typeface chosen for the text is very readable, even in a small size. The field service report will be easier to read. Also, main articles will usually appear on the outer pages, and most articles will be completed on the same page. The Service Meeting program, schedule for the Congregation Book Study, service report, Announcements, Theocratic News, Meetings for Field Service, Topic for Conversation, and Question Box will be found on the inner pages.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We hope that you will find this valuable instrument a more attractive and effective aid in the work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom and making disciples.</p>

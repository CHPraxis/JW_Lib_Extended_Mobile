<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man serving in the army in Hungary says that not long ago people used to laugh at those who spoke about the Bible. But times have changed. The soldier recently wrote the office of the Watch Tower Society in Budapest, saying:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A few days ago, I read your publication <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>Someone had given it to me on loan until I finished reading it. What is written in the book has touched me deeply and has made me think.” The soldier wanted a Bible and further information. Such response is no longer unusual in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another letter received at the Budapest office says: “I have read the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>The book has made a very deep impression on me, and I am writing you to ask for a Witness to visit my home so that I can have a regular Bible study.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>is a book that gives hope by pointing you to the Bible’s answers. It has been instrumental in changing many lives. If you would like to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I would like to receive the 256-page hardcover book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

They Do What They Can
Though unable to repay Jehovah for all his benefits to them, many do what they can to support the worldwide preaching work of his Witnesses. (Matthew 24:14; compare Mark 14:3-9.) Interesting in this regard is this letter from a family in Minnesota, U.S.A.:
“Dear Brothers,
“We are sending a donation in the amount of $​——. We are requesting that it be used for financing the worldwide work or be applied to the Kingdom Hall Building Fund, or to any other need the organization may have. . . .
“We are confident that this money will be used in harmony with [Jehovah’s] will. We would like to take this opportunity to offer our encouragement to continue the fine work, and especially thank you for the videotape of the [Watch Tower] Society’s worldwide operations. It was this tape that made us aware of the enormity of the work, and it impressed upon us that our voluntary donations are needed. Previously, we had let the congregation, circuit, and district take care of sending donations to you, but we now thank Jehovah for being patient with us in our shortsightedness and lovingly showing us the need for us personally to help finance this lifesaving work, in addition to the other forms of donations. We are resolving to send, as a family, a minimum of $​——​per month . . . directly to New York.
“Again, thank you for the fine service you have been to us and for the faithfulness to Jehovah you have displayed.”

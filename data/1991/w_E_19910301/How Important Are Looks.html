<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I became upset about my looks,” writes a youth from Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. “I felt that I was ugly and unattractive.” She explains: “I would barely eat anything for a few days, and I did lose a couple of pounds, but I would be so hungry from not eating that I would gorge food the next day and gain the weight back.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, at a Christian convention, she said: “I looked in a mirror and said to a friend, ‘I look so awful!’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“This very dear friend asked me if I had read the section ‘A Look at How You Look’ in the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work</em>. I told her no. She said to me, ‘My dear, you need to go home tonight and read it.’ And that’s exactly what I did.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I felt as if I were reading my life story. Then I came to a question that made me think, ‘Who is it that promotes the idea that you need a certain look if you are to be popular, successful, or happy?’”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The answer to the question, this youth said, made a dramatic change in her life. She concluded: “Through the helpful suggestions in the <em>Young People Ask </em>book, I saw the need to set my priorities straight.”</p>

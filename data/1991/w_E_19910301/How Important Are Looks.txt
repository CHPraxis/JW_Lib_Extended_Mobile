How Important Are Looks?
“I became upset about my looks,” writes a youth from Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. “I felt that I was ugly and unattractive.” She explains: “I would barely eat anything for a few days, and I did lose a couple of pounds, but I would be so hungry from not eating that I would gorge food the next day and gain the weight back.”
Later, at a Christian convention, she said: “I looked in a mirror and said to a friend, ‘I look so awful!’
“This very dear friend asked me if I had read the section ‘A Look at How You Look’ in the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. I told her no. She said to me, ‘My dear, you need to go home tonight and read it.’ And that’s exactly what I did.
“I felt as if I were reading my life story. Then I came to a question that made me think, ‘Who is it that promotes the idea that you need a certain look if you are to be popular, successful, or happy?’”
The answer to the question, this youth said, made a dramatic change in her life. She concluded: “Through the helpful suggestions in the Young People Ask book, I saw the need to set my priorities straight.”

“Mankind’s Search for God”
“This book was so interesting and absorbing I just couldn’t put it down,” writes a reader from Houston, Texas, U.S.A. He said that in his area there are people of just about every religion discussed in the book, but he admitted: “I did not understand their basic beliefs and how to direct them to the Bible for answers. This book has been an answer to my prayers.”
Mankind’s Search for God contains a thoroughly researched, in-depth discussion of such religions as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Islam, and Judaism. The reader from Texas observed: “This book discusses the beliefs of other people in a reasonable and respectful way, while encouraging them to continue their search for the true God, Jehovah. And the words come across in a very personable way, almost as if someone were sitting next to you carrying on a conversation.”

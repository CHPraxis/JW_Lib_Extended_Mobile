Readers around the world enjoy and benefit from it, as their letters of appreciation reveal. The Watch Tower branch office in Ghana, West Africa, received the following comments:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am one of the regular readers of your highly esteemed, educational and Biblical magazine <em>Awake! </em>The contents of the magazine have influenced my life-style in so many ways! I always like to read the magazine so much that I ignore my meals anytime I get a copy, although I belong to the Roman Catholic Church.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We feel that regardless of your religious affiliation, you too will benefit from the fascinating articles in <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to have the magazine <em>Awake! </em>delivered to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

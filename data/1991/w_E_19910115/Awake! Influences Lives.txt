Awake! Influences Lives
Awake! is published in 64 languages, and it has an average printing of 12,980,000 copies per issue. Readers around the world enjoy and benefit from it, as their letters of appreciation reveal. The Watch Tower branch office in Ghana, West Africa, received the following comments:
“I am one of the regular readers of your highly esteemed, educational and Biblical magazine Awake! The contents of the magazine have influenced my life-style in so many ways! I always like to read the magazine so much that I ignore my meals anytime I get a copy, although I belong to the Roman Catholic Church.”
We feel that regardless of your religious affiliation, you too will benefit from the fascinating articles in Awake!
I would like to have the magazine Awake! delivered to my home. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

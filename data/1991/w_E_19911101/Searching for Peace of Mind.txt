Searching for Peace of Mind
That is what a woman from Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A., said that she had been searching for in religion for many years. “Up until eight months ago,” she writes, “I thought I would never have it. Then the Witnesses came to my door in February. I have been studying for eight months, and I realize that you are the only ones preparing people for God’s Kingdom.”
This woman added: “One day my Witness friend gave me a book called The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? I have never enjoyed a book so much as this one. It is definitely one of the Watch Tower Society’s best publications.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a woman from Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A., said that she had been searching for in religion for many years. “Up until eight months ago,” she writes, “I thought I would never have it. Then the Witnesses came to my door in February. I have been studying for eight months, and I realize that you are the only ones preparing people for God’s Kingdom.”</p>

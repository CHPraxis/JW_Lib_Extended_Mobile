Light of Another Sort
Before dawn the Scandinavian sky is alive with luminous bands and streamers of light. This is the legendary aurora borealis, or northern lights. The people of Sweden thrill to witness this nighttime phenomenon.
Light of another sort, however, has captured the attention of many in this northern land​—the light of Bible truth. From the citizens of Stockholm on the icy Baltic Sea to the Lapps in the distant north, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Sweden share the good news of God’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus with all who will listen.
The 1991 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses features the activity of the Witnesses not only in Sweden but also in Hawaii and Thailand. In addition it provides an up-to-date picture of the work that Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing worldwide. If you would like to receive this 256-page book, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.

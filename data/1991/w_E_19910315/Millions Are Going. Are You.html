<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Going where? To the annual observance of the death of Jesus Christ. In 1990 a worldwide total of 9,950,058 attended. Why do people go? Because of what the death of Christ means for humankind. It means imminent relief from sickness, suffering, and death. Even dead loved ones will be resurrected to life on an earth restored to Paradise. How can the death of Jesus bring such blessings? You are invited to find out. Jehovah’s Witnesses welcome you to join them during this important event. Attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. This year the date is Saturday, March 30, after sunset. Check with the Witnesses locally for the exact time.</p>

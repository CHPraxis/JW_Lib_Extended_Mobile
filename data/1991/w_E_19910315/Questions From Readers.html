<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ Which Bible writer was a “general,” as mentioned in the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?</em></strong><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That helpful book about <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989031/19:99-23:291">God’s Word says on page 10</a>: “The Bible is also unique because of the claim made by many of its writers. Some 40 individuals, including kings, shepherds, fishermen, civil servants, priests, at least one general, and a physician, had a hand in writing the different parts of the Bible. But time and again, the writers made the same claim: that they were writing not their own thoughts but God’s.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some have asked which Bible writers were identified with those various professions or activities. In this regard, please consider the following:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Kings: </em>A number of Bible writers were kings. David and Solomon may come to mind most readily. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:3:0-19:3:0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 3, superscription;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:1-20:1:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Proverbs 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:1-21:1:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>) However, the song in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:10-23:38:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 38:10-20</a> was written by Hezekiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:9-23:38:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 38 Verse 9</a>) Many scholars believe that he also composed <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a>, perhaps before becoming king. And Hezekiah played a role in compiling <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:1-20:29:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs chapters 25–29</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:1-20:25:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:1</a>) The last chapter of Proverbs was prepared by “Lemuel the king.” Some identify him with King Hezekiah, though others think that Lemuel was King Solomon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:1-20:31:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Shepherds: </em>David and the prophet Amos worked as shepherds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:11-9:16:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:15-9:17:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:28-9:17:28" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:34-9:17:34" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:1-30:1:1" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Amos 1:1</a>) Amos wrote the Bible book bearing his name, and David composed numerous psalms. The famous <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:0-19:23:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> certainly reflects David’s familiarity with shepherding.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Fishermen: </em>Of Jesus’ apostles who were fishermen, John and Peter were later inspired to write books of the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:18-40:4:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 4:18-22</a>) Under divine inspiration John penned a Gospel account as well as three letters and the book of Revelation. Peter wrote two inspired letters.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Civil servants: </em>Both Daniel and Nehemiah were civil servants of foreign governments that exercised authority over God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:11-16:1:11" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 2:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:19-27:1:19" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Daniel 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:49-27:2:49" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2:49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:1-27:6:3" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> 6:1-3</a>) Two Bible books bear the names of these men.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Priests: </em>Two of God’s prophets used to pen Bible books were priests. They were Jeremiah and Ezekiel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:1-24:1:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jeremiah 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:3" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 1:1-3</a>) Additionally, Ezra was an Aaronic priest who “was a skilled copyist in the law of Moses.” He “prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah and to do it and to teach in Israel regulation and justice.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:1-15:7:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:10-15:7:11" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>General: </em>The role Joshua played in leading the army as the Israelites moved into the Promised Land and battled against many enemy peoples qualifies him as a general. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:1-6:1:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Joshua 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:5-6:11:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 11:5, 6</a>) He was privileged to write the book of Joshua. Then, too, some Bible readers may view David as a man who functioned as a general before he became a king.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:19:8-9:19:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Samuel 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:1-9:23:5" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 23:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><em>Physician: </em>Finally, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Colossians 4:14</a> mentions “Luke the beloved physician.” Luke wrote the Gospel bearing his name, and evidently Acts of Apostles as well.</p>

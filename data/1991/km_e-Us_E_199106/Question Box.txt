● How often should students have assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School?
One of the main purposes of the Theocratic Ministry School is to develop public speakers. For that reason, the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule makes provision for most of the talks to be assigned to brothers.
However, another important objective of the school is to train all of Jehovah’s people to be effective preachers and teachers in the Christian ministry. For this reason, it is appropriate for sisters also to enroll.
To benefit fully from the school, those enrolled should regularly receive student assignments. It is suggested that each student have at least one assignment every three months. If local circumstances allow, brothers can be given additional assignments. It is not necessary for elders who regularly give instruction talks and Bible highlights to be assigned student talks also.
For nearly half a century, the Theocratic Ministry School has helped millions to make spiritual progress and learn how to express themselves better in presenting the Kingdom message. All are encouraged to make full use of this marvelous provision from Jehovah God. Our aim should be to present ourselves approved to God, workmen “with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”​—2 Tim. 2:15.

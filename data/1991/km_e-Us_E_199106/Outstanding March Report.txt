Outstanding March Report
Jehovah’s blessing on our field ministry is seen in a new peak of 853,966 publishers reporting in March. This is an increase of 3,172 over our January peak. We also reached a peak of 602,340 home Bible studies, indicating an excellent potential for continued growth. The 72,605 auxiliary pioneers reporting in March represents the largest number ever for the month of March. We rejoice as God’s fellow workers and look to him for continued growth.​—1 Cor. 3:6-9.

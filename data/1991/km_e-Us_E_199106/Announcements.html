<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Contribution boxes at the Kingdom Hall should be clearly identified. When making contributions, be sure they are placed in the appropriate boxes​—for the Society’s Worldwide Work, for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, for local congregation needs. The elders may find it helpful to make announcements as needed in this regard. It is not appropriate for anyone to redirect donations placed in the various boxes. It is the responsibility of each person to indicate the purpose of his donation by placing it in the appropriate contribution box.</p>

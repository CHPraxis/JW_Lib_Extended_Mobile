Announcements
● Literature offer for June: Mankind’s Search for God. July and August: Any 32-page brochure except the School brochure. September: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
● The presiding overseer or someone assigned by him should audit the congregation accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.
● Since the convention this year will be three days, there is no need to cancel the Congregation Book Study the week of the convention.
● The Society has on occasion received correspondence from the postal service and other individuals about literature being placed in mailboxes without proper postage. Publishers should be reminded that, according to government regulations, anyone who puts material into a mailbox without having properly paid the postage faces a fine of up to $300 for each offense.
● Contribution boxes at the Kingdom Hall should be clearly identified. When making contributions, be sure they are placed in the appropriate boxes​—for the Society’s Worldwide Work, for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, for local congregation needs. The elders may find it helpful to make announcements as needed in this regard. It is not appropriate for anyone to redirect donations placed in the various boxes. It is the responsibility of each person to indicate the purpose of his donation by placing it in the appropriate contribution box.

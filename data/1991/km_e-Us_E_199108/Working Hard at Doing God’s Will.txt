Working Hard at Doing God’s Will
1 Purposeful hard work that produces desired results is most satisfying. (Eccl. 3:13) What work performed today holds the greatest potential for happiness now and on into the indefinite future? There is but one answer​—the doing of God’s will. The reasons for this will be thoroughly examined by means of talks, demonstrations, and experiences on our special assembly day program for the 1992 service year. The theme of the program will be “Working Hard at Doing God’s Will.”​—Eph. 6:6; 1 Tim. 4:10.
2 Many today are deeply dissatisfied and frustrated over their lot in life, a large part of which is filled by an occupation they do not enjoy. In contrast, doing Jehovah’s will in imitation of Christ fills our life with purpose and enables us to perform even our secular tasks with a positive outlook. What is involved in working hard at doing God’s will? What are some things we must guard against in order to continue living for God’s will? With respect to the preaching and teaching activity, how important is it to follow the directions and suggestions given by Jehovah’s organization? What unique opportunities are there for youths who concentrate on doing God’s will?
3 These questions will be satisfactorily answered by the program, which includes the two primary talks “Does God’s Will Govern Your Life?” and “Our Purpose in Life​—Doing God’s Will.” Plan now to be on hand and enjoy this special program to the full.

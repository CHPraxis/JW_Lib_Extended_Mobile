Question Box
● Do we have to mention to a householder our willingness to accept a modest donation to the Society’s worldwide work each time we call on him?
No. The May 1990 Our Kingdom Ministry article “Use Our Literature Wisely” stated: “In some cases, the subject of donations for our worldwide work may be awkward to discuss.” Good judgment needs to be used in this regard. We want people to have clearly in mind that ours is truly a Bible educational work and not a commercial activity. We are not soliciting donations.
It is generally good to explain clearly how our work is supported by voluntary donations when we initially leave literature with interested ones. If we keep in mind that we leave literature only with those who show interest or who express a desire to read our literature, then this aspect will generally be cared for.
Many of such interested ones take the initiative to offer donations voluntarily on subsequent visits. Others may ask how much an item  costs. We can briefly state that ours is not a commercial work, explaining that we offer our literature to interested ones without charge. They can also be informed that any who desire to support the worldwide work can make a modest voluntary donation. From time to time, as appropriate, we can bring up supporting the worldwide work of the Society if the person on whom we make the return visit does not do so.
We should keep in mind that even though we offer our literature to interested ones without charge, there are costs involved in publishing and distributing our literature. We have confidence that God’s spirit will move his servants and interested ones in the field to make voluntary donations to cover the costs of all aspects of the worldwide work.

“It Woke Me Up”
That is what a woman from Washington State, U.S.A., said regarding the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? She explained:
“For four years one of Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door regularly and left Watchtower and Awake! magazines. She encouraged me to study. She finally got me to read the Creation book, and that was it. She encouraged me to pray, and that was it. This book erased all doubts, and prayer brought help from Jehovah. . . .
“I know now that God really does exist. I know his name, Jehovah. I know he listens to prayers. I know why things are the way they are. I am at peace, and my peace grows each week as I learn more.”
This beautiful book, with its accurate descriptions of the universe and all the intricate details that make life possible on earth will fascinate you. You may receive a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

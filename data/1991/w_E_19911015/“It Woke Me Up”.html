<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a woman from Washington State, U.S.A., said regarding the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>She explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“For four years one of Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door regularly and left <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. She encouraged me to study.

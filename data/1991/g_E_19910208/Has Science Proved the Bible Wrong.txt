Has Science Proved the Bible Wrong?
Many today believe that it has. But has it really? Are the Bible’s laws on health and sanitation out-of-date? What about the Bible’s record of a global Flood? Has science disproved it? Or has the discovery of tens of thousands of quick-frozen carcasses, including those of huge mammoths, supported the Bible record?
Read the evidence in the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? It not only thoroughly covers all of man’s criticism of the Bible but also gives clear explanations as to why the Bible can be accepted as God’s Word. Consider the evidence yourself.

Question Box
▪ Are we not donating twice for the literature if a donation is made at the time we get literature and then when we put donations received in the field into the contribution boxes designated for the Society’s worldwide work?
No. Donations that go into the contribution boxes for the Society’s worldwide work are not only for the literature. Both publishers and sincerely interested persons in the field receive the literature without charge. When publishers make their donations, it is in support of maintaining branch offices, Bethel homes, missionary and ministerial schools, missionaries, traveling overseers, literature distribution centers, and numerous other support services necessary for accomplishing the overall assignment Jesus gave his disciples. Publishing literature is just a small part of this.
Therefore, when donations are received from interested ones in the field, we should not say that the donation is “for the literature.” As we explain to them, those who sincerely desire to read our literature receive it without charge. Any donations such ones give will be used to care for expenses involved in the worldwide work. The same is true of donations made by publishers.

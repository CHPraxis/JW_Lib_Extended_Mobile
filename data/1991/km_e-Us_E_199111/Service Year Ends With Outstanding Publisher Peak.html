<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Our new peak of 892,551 publishers reporting in August is 35,071 over our previous peak in July and 42,431 more than in August 1990. The 9,524 congregations reporting represent an increase of 274 over the number reporting in August of last year. Commendable zeal is being demonstrated by publishers in helping lovers of freedom take refuge in Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:19-19:31:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 31:19</a>.</p>

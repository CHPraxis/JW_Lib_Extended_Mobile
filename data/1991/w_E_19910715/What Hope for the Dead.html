<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in Augusta, Georgia, U.S.A., wrote: “I recently lost my younger sister in a fatal car accident. She was just 18, full of life and ready to graduate. I found a couple of your pamphlets placed among some flowers at her gravesite. They have helped me, and I would like to order the following book you offer.”</p>

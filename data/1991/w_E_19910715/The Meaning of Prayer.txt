The Meaning of Prayer
“In Hebrew, the principal word for prayer comes from the root, ‘to judge’, and the usual reflexive form . . . means literally, ‘to judge oneself.’” So observes The Authorised Daily Prayer Book. The connotation is that one of the functions of prayer is that it should help the person see if he measures up to the righteous standards and requirements of God.
For this reason, throughout the Bible, we are told that unless one is doing the will of God, his prayers will not be heard favorably. “Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.”​—Proverbs 15:29; 1 John 5:14.
Self-examination before Jehovah God certainly should make the one praying humble and contrite. This gives all the more force to Jesus’ parable of the boastful Pharisee and the contrite tax collector who came to the temple to pray.​—Luke 18:9-14.
Thus, whether we pray to Jehovah to thank, praise, or petition him, prayer is always an occasion for self-examination. In this way, prayer draws us closer to Jehovah and strengthens our relationship with him.

What Hope for the Dead?
A woman in Augusta, Georgia, U.S.A., wrote: “I recently lost my younger sister in a fatal car accident. She was just 18, full of life and ready to graduate. I found a couple of your pamphlets placed among some flowers at her gravesite. They have helped me, and I would like to order the following book you offer.”
The woman asked for the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. She concluded: “I think it will help me and my family to find some understanding and peace within ourselves.”

I would like to receive the 256-page hardcover book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

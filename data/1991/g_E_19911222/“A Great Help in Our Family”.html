<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a mother wrote regarding the book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It. </em>It especially helped her 18-year-old daughter, as the mother explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Recently she and her father went on a business trip, at which time I tucked into her suitcase her new copy of the <em>Happiness </em>book. When she got back, her whole attitude and expression had changed. My prayers had been answered! She has bubbled with enthusiasm since reading the entire book from cover to cover.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Would you like some encouraging help? Chapters such as “You Can Cope with Life’s Problems,” “Money Problems​—What Help?” and “Sex​—Which Advice Really Works?” may contain just what you need.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to receive the hardcover 192-page book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 5.)</p>

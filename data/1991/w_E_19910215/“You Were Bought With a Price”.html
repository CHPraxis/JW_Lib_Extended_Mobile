<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>This was foreshadowed on Atonement Day when the high priest entered the Most Holy.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>What role does Christ’s blood play in our salvation? Since Noah’s day, true worshipers have viewed blood as sacred. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4-6</a>) Blood plays an important part in the life process, for the Bible says that “the soul [or life] of the flesh is in the blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:11</a>) So the Mosaic Law required that when an animal was sacrificed, its blood be poured out before Jehovah. At times blood was also placed upon the horns of the altar. Clearly, the atoning power of a sacrifice was in its blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:15-3:8:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 8:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:9-3:9:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9:9</a>) “Nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:22-58:9:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. (a) What purpose was served by God’s restricting the use of blood? (b) What was significant about the way Jesus was put to death?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Little wonder, then, that under the Law, any misuse of blood was punishable by death! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:10</a>) All of us know that when a substance is made rare, or severely restricted as to its use, its value increases. Jehovah’s curb on its use ensured that blood would be viewed, not as something of ordinary value, but as precious, valuable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:29-44:15:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 15:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:29-58:10:29" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:29</a>) This accorded with the exalted purpose the blood of Christ would serve. Fittingly, he died in a manner that caused his blood to be shed. Thus, it was evident that Christ not only sacrificed his human body but poured out his soul, sacrificed his very life as a perfect human! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:12-23:53:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:12</a>) Christ did not forfeit the legal right to that life because of imperfection, so his poured-out blood had great value and could be presented before God for the atonement of mankind’s sins.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. (a) What did Christ take into heaven, and why? (b) How was it evident that God accepted Christ’s sacrifice?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:50" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>) Rather, he took what that blood symbolized: the legal value of his sacrificed perfect human life. Before the person of God, he could make formal presentation of that life as a ransom in exchange for sinful mankind. Jehovah’s acceptance of that sacrifice became evident at Pentecost 33 C.E., when the holy spirit came upon 120 disciples in <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4</a>) Christ, as it were, now owned the human race by purchase.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. (a) What is the new covenant, who are the parties to it, and what purpose does it serve? (b) Why did a death have to take place to make the new covenant possible, and what role does Christ’s blood play?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Leading up to that, the 144,000 king-priests are “bought from among mankind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 14:4</a>) This is accomplished by means of “a new covenant.” This covenant is a contract between Jehovah God and the spiritual Israel of God for its members to serve as kings and priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:6-58:8:13" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Hebrews 8:6-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:9</a>) Yet, how is a covenant between God and imperfect man possible? Paul explains: “Where there is a covenant [between God and imperfect man], the death of the human covenanter needs to be furnished. For a covenant is valid over dead victims, since it is not in force at any time while the human covenanter is living.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:16-58:9:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8, 9. How is the ransom related to the new covenant?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Hence, the ransom sacrifice is fundamental to the new covenant, of which Jesus is the Mediator. Paul wrote: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all​—this is what is to be witnessed to at its own particular times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:5, 6</a>) Those words especially apply to the 144,000, with whom the new covenant is made.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>When God made a covenant with fleshly Israel, it was not legally valid until animal blood was shed in sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:18-58:9:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:18-21</a>) Similarly, for the new covenant to become operative, Christ had to shed the “blood of the covenant.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Luke 22:20</a>) With Christ acting as both High Priest and “mediator of a new covenant,” God applies the value of Jesus’ blood to those being brought into the new covenant, legally crediting them with human righteousness.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10, 11. (a) How does the ransom extend beyond anointed Christians? (b) Who are the great crowd, and what standing do they have with God?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Is it only anointed Christians who can experience a release by ransom, the forgiveness of their sins? No, God is reconciling to himself all other things by making peace through the blood shed on the torture stake, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:14-51:1:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Colossians 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 20</a> indicates. This involves the things in the heavens (the 144,000) as well as the things upon the earth. The latter are those in line for earthly life, humans who will enjoy perfect life in Paradise on earth. Especially since 1935 has there been a concerted effort to gather such ones. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a> describes them as “a great crowd” who owe salvation to God and to the Lamb. They still need to survive “the great tribulation” and be ‘guided to fountains of waters of life,’ for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:5-66:20:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 20:5</a> shows that such ones will become fully alive, having perfect human life, by the end of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ. Those who then pass a final test in their perfect human state will be declared righteous for everlasting life on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 20:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Nevertheless, in a preliminary way, the great crowd have already “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>) Christ does not act as Mediator of the new covenant toward them, yet they benefit from this covenant through the work of God’s Kingdom. Christ still acts toward them, however, as High Priest, through whom Jehovah can and does apply the ransom to the extent of their now being declared righteous as God’s friends. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="31-1" class="b">James 2:23</a>.)

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>As to their standing with God, it might seem that those of the great crowd differ little from pre-Christian worshipers.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:25-45:3:26" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 3:25, 26</a>) They enjoyed forgiveness of their sins only in a provisional way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:1-19:32:2" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>) Rather than fully relieving them of the “consciousness of sins,” animal sacrifices caused “a reminding of sins.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13. What advantages do we have over pre-Christian servants of God?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>It is different with true Christians today. They worship on the basis of a ransom that has been paid!

It is easily comprehended, yet profound enough to strike awe into the <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>greatest intellect. Our review of the workings of the ransom has barely scratched the surface. Yet, we exclaim with the apostle Paul: “O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>No criticism can be leveled against God for forgiving the sins that were committed in the past by pre-Christian worshipers.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:33-45:8:33" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Romans 8:33</a>) At great cost to himself, God has been perfectly legal, or upright, in his dealings, completely refuting Satan’s lying claim that Jehovah is an unjust ruler!

At times we feel unclean, as if we don’t ‘fit’ in Jehovah’s clean organization.” Granted, even after becoming Christians, some may reap a degree of suffering from past mistakes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Still, there is no reason to feel unclean in Jehovah’s eyes if one has repented. “The blood of the Christ” is able to “cleanse our consciences from dead works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20. How can faith in the ransom relieve a Christian of unnecessary guilt?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Yes, faith in the ransom can help to relieve us of unnecessary burdens of guilt. One young sister admitted: “I have been struggling with the unclean habit of masturbation for over 11 years now. I nearly left the congregation at one point, feeling that Jehovah would never want a person so disgusting to defile his congregation.” We must remember, though, Jehovah is “good and ready to forgive” as long as we conscientiously put up a fight against unrighteousness, not succumbing to it!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">21. How should the ransom affect our view of those who offend us?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>The ransom should also have a bearing on how we deal with others. For instance, how do you react when a fellow Christian offends you? Do you freely extend Christlike forgiveness? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:3-42:17:4" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Luke 17:3, 4</a>) Are you “tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving [others] just as God also by Christ freely forgave you”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>) Or do you tend to harbor grudges or nurture resentment? That certainly would be missing the purpose of the ransom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:15-40:6:15" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Matthew 6:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">22, 23. (a) What effect should the ransom have on our goals and life-style? (b) What resolve should all Christians make regarding the ransom?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Finally, appreciation for the ransom should have a profound effect on our goals and life-style. Said Paul: “You were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:23-46:7:23" data-bid="64-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>) Are economic needs​—home, job, food, clothing—​still the center of your life? Or are you seeking the Kingdom first, putting faith in God’s promise to provide for you? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:33" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Matthew 6:25-33</a>) Might you slave for your employer but fail to make enough room for theocratic activities? Remember, Christ “gave himself for us that he might . . . cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Titus 2:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:15-47:5:15" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 5:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>“Thanks to God through Jesus Christ” for this superlative gift​—the ransom! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:25-45:7:25" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Romans 7:25</a>) May we never miss the purpose of the ransom but allow it to be a real force in our lives. In thought, in word, and in deed, may we always glorify God, gratefully remembering that we have been bought with a price.</p>

You Are Invited to the “Lovers of Freedom” District Convention
SINCE November 1989, the subject of freedom has been made prominent as never before. The peoples of Eastern European countries in particular have been enjoying more political freedom than they have had for 40 and more years.
But there is a freedom of far greater importance than any political freedom. We can read about it in God’s Word, the Bible. Jesus Christ once said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32) Yes, dedicated Christians have been set free from the fear of man and from bondage to sin and death, as we read at Romans 6:18, 22. We also read that “where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.” (2 Corinthians 3:17) In fact, God’s Word holds out the bright prospect that “the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.”​—Romans 8:21.
If anyone wishes to gain Christian freedom at the present time, he must put forth real effort. It is by no means simply a matter of following the course of least resistance. And to continue to enjoy this freedom takes additional effort, in view of the forces that tend to rob us of freedom: Satan the Devil, his wicked world, and our own inherited sinful tendencies. Jehovah God has provided help by means of his inspired Word, by means of his holy spirit, and by means of his visible organization.​—Luke 11:13.
To help all freedom lovers to strengthen their grip on freedom, this year’s district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses do justice to the theme “Lovers of Freedom.” These conventions will be three days in length, beginning Friday morning at 10:20 and continuing until 4:00 p.m. Sunday. All who come will be spiritually refreshed and built up by stirring discourses, interesting interviews, effective demonstrations, and a striking Bible-based drama; nor should we overlook the joys of heartwarming association with friends old and new, the pleasure of joining with thousands of others in singing our Kingdom songs, and sharing in heartfelt public prayers.
May all dedicated servants of Jehovah let absolutely nothing interfere with their being on hand Friday morning when these conventions begin. And be sure to come with not only Bible and songbook but also pencil and notebook to take notes. Come, too, with a real consciousness of your spiritual need as part of a free people.​—Matthew 5:3.

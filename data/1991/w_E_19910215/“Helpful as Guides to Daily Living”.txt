“Helpful as Guides to Daily Living”
That is what a woman from Toronto, Canada, called the publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. “I enjoy reading them and find the material very informative, heartwarming, and above all very helpful as guides to daily living.”
She added: “I am a university graduate, and I must shockingly admit that I have learned much more through your publications than through all my years of study. I especially enjoyed your book Making Your Family Life Happy. No other publications have managed to have such a positive impact on my life as yours have​—they have helped me immensely; and for this I truly thank you.”
The above-mentioned book, Making Your Family Life Happy, gives specific suggestions that help to solve problems and make marriage the delight the Creator meant it to be. For your copy, fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the hardcover 192-page book Making Your Family Life Happy. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

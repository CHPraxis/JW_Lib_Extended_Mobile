<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SEEING so much dishonesty among adults, young people often copy their example. How refreshing​—as well as noteworthy—​it is, therefore, when someone is honest! <em>Sports Illustrated </em>introduced such an example of honesty with the comment: “Here’s a story to restore one’s faith.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The magazine reported on a youth baseball game in Florida, in the United States. The first baseman fielded a ground ball and tried to tag the runner going from first base to second. The umpire, Laura Benson, called the runner out, but the first baseman told her: “Ma’am, I didn’t tag the runner.” So Benson awarded the runner second base.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">During another game two weeks later, the same youngster was involved in a similar play. Benson was again the umpire. This time she thought the boy had missed the tag, and she called the runner safe. Although the boy did not say anything as he returned to his position, she sensed something was wrong by the way he looked at her. So she went over to him and asked: “Did you tag the runner?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When Benson reversed her decision and called the runner out, the opposing coaches protested. But she explained what had happened two weeks earlier and said: “If a kid is that honest, I have to give it to him.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Those who are dishonest seem to prosper in the world today. It is as a Bible psalmist once noted: “These are the wicked, who are at ease indefinitely. They have increased their means of maintenance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:12-19:73:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 73:12</a>) In reality, though, honesty eventually pays the finest dividends. It earns one the respect of fellow humans. But more important, it wins the favor of Jehovah God, who can reward one with everlasting life.</p>

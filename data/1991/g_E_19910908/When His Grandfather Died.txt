When His Grandfather Died
A mother from Virginia Beach, Virginia, U.S.A., wrote: “Last month I lost my father in death. He and my youngest son were very close, despite the distance that separated them. On notifying him that his grandfather had died, he began to cry sadly.
“I quickly looked for the tract What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? As soon as I found it, while his face was still wet with tears, I began to read it to him. When I finished, he was much calmer. Thank you for such valuable information, which was very practical at such a painful time.”
You can receive this comforting tract, along with others, by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the tract What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? along with other tracts. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 5.)

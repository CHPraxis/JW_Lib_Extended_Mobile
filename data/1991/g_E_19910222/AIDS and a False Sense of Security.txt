AIDS and a False Sense of Security
A WOMAN who tested positive for the AIDS virus wrote, as quoted in The New York Times of June 16, 1990: “I am a 36-year-old happily married, white female, who has never had syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia, has never used crack, never been an intravenous drug user, never had a blood transfusion.”
She adds: “Because I haven’t had sex with anyone other than my husband since we were married, this means I have been positive for at least five years with no symptoms.” Is this woman unique? Not at all, as she observes: “I know of at least a score of women from my support groups of similar socioeconomic background with a similar story.”
How, then, have such people become infected with AIDS? The woman explains: “Clearly, I contracted the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through heterosexual contact [prior to marriage]. . . . Equally clearly, that man would today be classified as a risky sexual partner, but it was not apparent to me at the time.”
AIDS has often been classified as a disease limited almost exclusively to male homosexuals and intravenous drug users. But based on her own experience and firsthand information, the woman maintains that this view “gives white middle-class society a false sense of security.”
She concludes: “AIDS will emerge into the population at large if we continue to think in terms of risk groups, to think in terms of the other getting it, not me. We are all at risk. If I could become [AIDS] positive, any woman (or man) can too.”
What she is saying, in other words, is that any woman or man who engages in premarital sex​—who commits fornication—​can become infected. How wise, therefore, to heed the Bible command: “Flee from fornication. Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but he that practices fornication is sinning against his own body.”​—1 Corinthians 6:18.

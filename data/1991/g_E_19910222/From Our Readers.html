<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>“Awake!” Goes to College  </strong>I am an English professor, and I have been using <em>Awake! </em>magazines in my college composition courses for the past seven years . . . The articles in <em>Awake! </em>are not only entertaining and informative but also of the highest grammatical quality. I use them to cite proper use of punctuation, idiomatic expressions, figurative language, and diction.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Life Beyond Earth?  </strong>Thank you for the revealing article “Is There Life Beyond the Earth?” (April 8, 1990) I had never before received a satisfying answer to this question. But the logical reasoning in your article, based on the Bible, helped me appreciate what a marvelous privilege we have in living on this unique planet.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Selling Blood  </strong>The articles on “Selling Blood Is Big Business” (October 22, 1990) were of special interest to me, since I was offered a well-paying job drawing blood for a blood bank. After reading the material, I was convinced that this would be wrong. Although I could have used the money, I considered the harmful effects of blood and turned down the job.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Mistaken Identity  </strong>In your November 8, 1990, issue about UFO’s, you refer to the “late Dr. James McCampbell.” Almost certainly you meant Dr. James McDonald, a scientist who died in 1971. As to myself, I have frequently been tardy, but some readers may be pleased to hear that I am not yet “late” in the terminal sense.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">James M. McCampbell, United States</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>To borrow a phrase from Mark Twain, it would appear that the reports of Mr. McCampbell’s death have been greatly exaggerated. Sorry for the mix-up.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Picking Movies  </strong>I am ten years old. Thank you for the article “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Pick a Decent Movie?” (August 8, 1990) Some time after reading it, I was tempted to watch a bad movie, but I remembered the advice you gave and refused.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sj">M. B., United States</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To be quite honest, there have been times when I have walked out on a movie. At other times, though, I have stayed when I should have left. I was afraid of displeasing my so-called friends when I should have been more concerned about displeasing God. I have found this information very helpful. Thank you so very much for caring about young ones.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Lead Removal  </strong>We were quite surprised to read in your article “A Lead-Laden World?” (August 8, 1990) that <em>‘only </em>a very expensive reverse-osmosis filter’ will effectively remove lead that has leached into one’s drinking water from house pipes. It is widely acknowledged that there are other ways of removing the lead.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sj">G. J., United States</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>We are sorry if we gave the wrong impression. It was not our intention to exclude alternative means of lead removal, such as distillation systems.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Garbage Glut  </strong>A friend of mine sent me a gift subscription to <em>Awake!, </em>and I find the material to be varied and interesting. I was filled with dismay to read the articles on the garbage glut (September 22, 1990) because I never thought that this matter was so complicated! Although I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I like the excellent topics published in your magazines.</p>

Finnish Hospitality
THE lake was frozen, covered with a 16-inch-thick [41 cm] sheet of ice. The air temperature was 5 degrees Fahrenheit [-15° C.], quite normal for a day in February in Finland. And there was our host, Martti, clearing a hole in the ice. This was his first opportunity to extend Finnish hospitality to a foreigner from the Caribbean Islands.
Among the people in tropical Puerto Rico, what I was about to do could be regarded as foolishness. But among the Finns, taking a dip in ice-cold water is an old practice that is becoming increasingly popular. The Finnish language even has a specific word, avanto, that refers to a hole kept open in the ice for brief ice-water immersion.
This “cold hospitality” lasted only a few seconds and was preceded and followed by about 15 minutes in a rather hot sauna of 185 degrees Fahrenheit [85° C.]. I found the experience exhilarating and even chose to do it a second time, much to the delight of my Finnish friends!
For some the practice is just recreation. Others claim that it improves their health, prevents certain ailments, reduces stress, and increases stamina. These claims and other issues related to the Finnish sauna and the practice of winter swimming are presently under scientific investigation.​—Contributed.

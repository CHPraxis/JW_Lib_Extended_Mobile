<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” </strong>Those words of our Lord Jesus Christ, found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>, were spoken at the time he instituted the memorial of his death. It is Jesus’ death that opened to humankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in Paradise conditions. So his death is something we must remember. Will you observe the memorial of it this year?</p>

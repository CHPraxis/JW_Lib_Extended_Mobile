An Event You Should Not Miss
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” Those words of our Lord Jesus Christ, found at Luke 22:19, were spoken at the time he instituted the memorial of his death. It is Jesus’ death that opened to humankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in Paradise conditions. So his death is something we must remember. Will you observe the memorial of it this year?
Please accept this invitation from Jehovah’s Witnesses to join them in memorializing this important event. This observance will be after sundown on the date that corresponds with Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. Mark down the date on your calendar so that you do not forget. It is Saturday, March 30, 1991. The one giving you this invitation can tell you the exact meeting place and time.

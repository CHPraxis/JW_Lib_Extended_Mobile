Would You Welcome a Visit?
Last year a woman from Corpus Christi, Texas, U.S.A., wrote the Watchtower Society in Brooklyn, New York, saying: “My name is Emily, and I have been studying the literature that some of Jehovah’s Witnesses gave me a few weeks ago. After reading the magazines and comparing them with my family Bible, I saw that the Roman Catholic Church didn’t seem to teach what was in the Holy Bible. They never spoke of the name of God or of the coming Kingdom of God, which I found to be key subjects in my Bible. I have stopped going to my family church and have started to study the Bible, thanks to your truthful literature.
“I would like to begin fellowship with a local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Please send a message to them to come to my home so that we may talk.”
One of Jehovah’s Witnesses would also be pleased to visit you and help you increase your knowledge about God, his Kingdom, and his purposes, as recorded in the Bible. To avail yourself of this service, simply fill in the information requested below and mail it to the address on the coupon.
I would like to know more about the Bible. Please arrange for somebody to call on me.

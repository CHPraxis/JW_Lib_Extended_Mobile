<p><span class="font10">YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span class="font5"> JEHOVAH knows those who belong to him.” I (2 Tim. 2:19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> His creatures, then, should try to know Jehovah. The majority of men have failed in gaining knowledge of Jehovah because of their indifference toward his Word. It is through his Word, the Bible, that Jehovah has revealed himself to men; yet very few persons have taken time to read this collection of letters to us or even to listen to those who have read and are familiar with the Bible. The many letters and books contained within the Bible were written under inspiration for our learning and admonition. However, by far the greater number of the human race have chosen a god to their own liking or have set themselves above God and outside his authority. They do not see how he shows loving-kindness and protection under any and all conditions to those who belong to him. At the same time, men of the world do not fear Jehovah, the one who is able to destroy those opposing him.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font5">When Paul wrote to Timothy the words, “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” he had in mind a situation that existed many centuries earlier. It was an occasion that happened in the wilderness near Sinai where Moses had led the children of Israel when they left the land of Egypt. This was what happened: Ko-rah, Dathan and Abiram became arrogant and, along with two hundred and fifty of the Israelites who were leaders in the community, gathered together and protested against Moses and Aaron. They said they had had enough of Moses and Aaron and that they needed their services no longer. They claimed these two men 5 had exalted themselves above the Lord’s assembly. (Num. 16:1-3) God’s Word shows us that it was Jehovah who chose and used Moses as his mediator and special servant to express his will, not only before kings as he did before Pharaoh, but also before the children of Israel. Even though the Israelites had been brought through the Red sea and protected by the hand of Almighty God, and although he had used Moses to lead them all the way, still these Jews were against Moses. So Moses told this wicked group and the whole community of Israel, “In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy, that he may have him come near him; and whomsoever he chooses he will have come near him.” (Num. 16:5, AT) Readers of God’s Word know the results of the next day’s happenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The account informs us that Moses directed the children of Israel to withdraw from the neighborhood of the dwellings of these obstreperous persons. He told them, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything at all that belongs to them, lest you be swept away with all their sins.” (Num.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">16: 26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font5"> So those who did not want to be contaminated -with unrighteous deeds moved away from the neighborhood of the dwellings where Korah, Dathan and Abiram were. When Dathan and Abiram came out of their tents and stood in the doorways with their wives, sons and their little ones, then Moses spoke to the entire congregation. “Hereby shall you know that the Lord has sent me to do all these deeds, and that it has not been of my own choice: if these men die as all men die, and suffer the fate of all men, it is not the Lord who has sent me; but if the Lord does something new, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they descend into Sheol alive, then you shall know that these men have despised the Lord.” (Num. 16:2830, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font5"> That is just what happened: the ground moved away from under their feet and the men disappeared, swallowed up alive in the crevice that was made. They descended into Sheol, the grave, and then the earth closed over them and they perished from among the children of Israel. Yes, it is true that “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”, and he is able to remove and take away forever the unrighteous ones and those who speak evil, separating them from “those who belong to him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore, it is quite evident from the Lord’s Word that those who renounce unrighteousness can gain the favor of Jehovah God. That is why Paul said to Timothy, “For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal, ‘Jehovah knows those who belong to him,’ and, ‘Let everyone mentioning the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.’ ” (2 Tim. 2:19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> It is necessary, then, for every creature who loves life to “do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright”. (2 Tim. 2:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> This is the time to shun the empty speeches of those who have so much to say but who do not have God’s backing, much like Korah and the 250 older men of influence of the Israelites, all of whom were fighting against God’s servants. Individually, everyone must see to it that he understands the Lord’s Word, studies it well and keeps presenting himself before God in service so as to be an approved person. Doing the work that is assigned to you to do is what counts. If you do that which is proper in the Lord’s sight, he will bless you richly and you will find that you have an abundance. Service in God’s organization anywhere satisfies! One must truly be interested in the work of God and want to know him well. “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and we, his creatures, should certainly want to know him. To do so means life everlasting.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>THEOCRACY’S INCREASE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Zechariah, an individual used by Jehovah, had a vision of a man with a measuring line. The account, according to the second chapter of Zechariah, tells us that this young man with a measuring line in his hand went out to measure Jerusalem and to see how broad and how long it was. Just as the angel who was talking to the young man was going away, another angel came forth to meet him and said, “ 'Kun, speak to that young man yonder, saying, “Jerusalem shall be inhabited like unwalled villages, because of the mass of men and beasts within her.” And I will be unto her,’ is the oracle of the Lord, ‘a wall of fire round about her, and I will be the splendor within her.’ ” (Zech. 2:4, 5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font5"> This young man was certainly interested in Jerusalem or he would not have taken time to find out how broad or how long it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today we find in the earth a group of Christian men and women who, like this young man, are sincerely interested in the Jerusalem which is above and which is the mother of us all. (Gal. 4: 26, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> They are really interested in God’s organization and in its expansion. Walls are not its boundaries. No, it is an expanding city like an unwalled village. It would be hard to take accurate measurements, because of its constant growth due to incoming crowds. The class of faithful Christians prefigured by this young man was quite a small organization during the years from 1914 to 1918, for then there was only a remnant of God’s faithful people who were truly examining the prophecies and trying to ascertain their meaning in order to find out what their work would be in this great organization of Jerusalem. They wanted its measure and they wanted to know more about God’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world had gone to war. Nation had risen against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There was sickness and sorrow and pain, scattered from one end of the earth to the other, as foretold in Matthew, chapter 24. The nations and peoples of the earth were extremely selfish and interested only in getting the things they wanted. They had no time for God nor were they endeavoring to measure up to God’s principles of truth and righteousness. Even the religionists of the great Protestant and Catholic organizations, the Jewish and pagan religious orders, were involved in the affairs of the world, afterward devoting their attention to the League of Nations and the problems of this old, dying system of things. Forgotten was the statement in the Word of God: “Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> No, the nations of the earth had no time to seek the kingdom of God as the only hope for mankind. This seeking was left to a remnant of God’s people, just a few faithful followers pictured by this young man in the vision of Zechariah. They were willing to use the measuring line in God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This city of Jerusalem was not to be like a walled city, having limited boundaries so no one could get in or out if the gates were closed; but it would be like an unwalled village without limits. It was to be a growing city because of the mass of men and of beasts that would come to inhabit it. It would continue to spread and reach out into new fields. This is just what is now happening to God’s organization. From 1918 onward this little remnant of God’s people persistently continued to proclaim the kingdom of God as at hand. The nations were not interested in that kingdom. They were opposed to it. But, on the other hand, thousands of persons of good will from all these nations hearkened to the message of God’s anointed and they came to God’s organization, Jerusalem, this expanding city, and sought advice and instruction within it. According to the Society’s own reports, back in the year 1918 there were only 3,868 persons who were proclaiming the message of the Kingdom to the peoples of the world, inviting them to seek refuge, comfort and consolation within Jerusalem. The Lord’s spirit was upon this little band of faithful servants as they steadily preached and reached out to the ends of the earth with this good news. It was not long until many people who were listening and studying with Jehovah’s witnesses in order to learn of Jehovah took their stand on his side. The city continued to grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the nations of the world went into their second world war and brought about greater regimentation and totalitarian rule among the people, still this remnant with the people of good will kept right on preaching the Word. Today we see gathered into this unwalled city even greater numbers of those who Jehovah knows belong to him. Is it not now as it was stated by Isaiah the prophet centuries ago in chapter 54, verses 2, 3, “Enlarge the site of your tent, and stretch without limit the curtains of your home; lengthen your cords, and make fast your pegs! For to right and to left shall you spread abroad, and your descendants shall take over the heritage of the nations, and shall people the desolate cities”? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(AT)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses see this expansion work going on. They live in the growing city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this great “mass of men” there is a multitude of cattle, and this may fitly represent the wealth of God’s organization. Christ Jesus said, ‘Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; these also I must gather so that there will be one floek, one shepherd.’ Christ Jesus is the Good Shepherd of this great organization which he gathers together in its completion just before the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which is Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, in 1951, we find the remnant of God’s people working alongside the great crowd who have been marked in their foreheads by the anointed class. The prophet Ezekiel (9:1-11) gave us a picture of the man with the writer’s inkliorn who went through the city and marked in the forehead those who were sighing and crying because of the abominations that existed in their city or organization. Certainly there are thousands, and it may yet run into the millions, of people who are sighing and crying because of the terrible conditions that exist in Christendom and throughout the whole world and who are seeking consolation, truth and comfort. These will be found; there is no doubt of that, because, as Paul said, “Jehovah knows those who belong to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God’s Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, is doing the gathering work today, and he has assigned to his people in the earth the work of preaching the good news of the incoming new world. This good news attracts the meek to God’s Word, and that draws them closer to Jehovah. Having come to this unwalled village, trusting in God and having confidence in his Word, they are not afraid of what might happen to them. They are sure of protection. Was not God able to protect the congregation of Israel from being engulfed in the landslide that covered up the unfaithful opposition? Was not God able to preserve Noah and his family through the flood? So, then, is Jehovah God not able to preserve those who have come into this unwalled village? He certainly is! For according to the vision of Zechariah, “I will be ... a wall of fire round about her, and I will be the splendor within her.” So, then, those who have come to the Lord’s organization, Jerusalem, recognize Jehovah as their God and Jerusalem as his organization and feel safe because God is their protector. They need not depend on the walls or bulwarks that nations of this world set up to protect themselves, because “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The glory of this entire organization, the Jerusalem which is above, his woman, is Jehovah himself; for he said, “I will be the glory in the midst of her.” In these last days of the old world, it is Jehovah God who has built up this organization and brought about Theocracy’s increase. Its growth and splendor are not due to any man or earthly organization. It is he who through his Son is gathering together the “other sheep” by the hundreds of thousands, making a great city. Jehovah gives it his blessing and protection. These people in the great city are not idle, but they continue to spread out and preach the message of God’s kingdom unto the ends of the earth so that all shall know that Jehovah is the Supreme One of the universe and that the vindication of his name and word is near at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>FLIGHT FROM GREAT BABYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The call goes forth in the sixth verse of this prophecy of Zechariah, “Ho, ho! flee from the land of the north.” This is an oracle of the Lord or a direct command from him: “For as the four winds of the heavens have I spread you abroad . . . Ho! Zion, deliver thyself,—thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. . . . For his own honour hath he sent me unto the nations that are spoiling you,—Surely he that toucheth you toucheth the pupil of mine eye.”—Zech. 2: 6-8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is due to God’s mercy and loving-kindness that he has gathered together the remnant from the nation of the north, which is Babylon. lie elsewhere stated, ‘Come out of her, my people, and be not partakers of her plagues, and do not be contaminated with her sins.’ (Rev. 18: 4) He has seen to it that the remnant of his people, Zion, escape from this wicked Devil-ruled world to a place of safety in his city, along with his “other sheep” who are now coming out. The rulers of the world have tried to regiment all peoples of the nations and make them keep in line with their selfish dictates. However, God commands that they shall escape from Babylon and become a free people— if not in body, then in conscience; and they do! They come out from under its oppression and servitude and sinful way of life. No longer are they slaves to that wicked organization. They will render to Caesar the things that are his, but not what belongs to God! Their eyes are opened to a new world and a New World society. “For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.”-—Gal. 5:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have already been freed from the opres-sion of Babylon, even though in some cases they are still in jails, work camps or concentration camps, are not satisfied just to hold this freedom to themselves. At every opportunity they will talk to strangers, even though physically still captive in Babylon. They will help strangers to see clearly the way of life by directing them away from this old system and into a new which leads to life eternal. Paul said, at Hebrews 13:1: “Let your brotherly love continue. Do not forget kindness to strangers.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who renounce unrighteousness and take their stand wholly on Jehovah’s side, he will look after as his very own because “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. If anyone touches these that he has chosen and blessed, it is like touching the pupil of his eye. Jehovah’s organization, the free Jerusalem, is our mother and is the closest thing to the Lord. He has created it and made it for his praise. It will be just too bad for the individuals or the nations that fight against God or his witnesses. These belong to him and in due time he will execute judgment against opposers. This does not mean that Jehovah will not allow individuals or part of his organization to suffer hurt. He will; in order that the individuals involved therein may prove their integrity and faithfulness. However, he will take cognizance of the offenders, and at the same time advises us, “If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men. Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says Jehovah.’ ”—Rom. 12:18,19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is watching what is going on throughout his entire organization. He knows how his people will be treated. “Moreover, you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death, and you will be objects of hatred by all persons because of my name. And yet not a hair of your heads will by any means perish.” (Luke 21:16-18, A<sup>T</sup>W) Even so, a greater witness than ever in vindication of Jehovah’s name will be given. We are in the last days of this old world and we must expect these things. Now is the time to gather together a great crowd for his name’s sake, and this crowd is being gathered together from the ends of the earth with haste. So a sharp call and a loud one goes out unto the ends of the earth to all the inhabiters of Babylon who are sighing and crying to flee from her and escape from her oppressive acts now and her complete destruction later. If you love the Lord, then seek his protection and come to his city, the unwalled village, for Jehovah is a wall of fire round about it. Those in it he loves, and to touch one of his faithful servants is like touching the pupil of his eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time is not very far distant when Jehovah God will plunder the nations and destroy them. When Jesus was asked what the sign of the end of this world would be, he gave his apostles many things that they could watch for, and these we see in fulfillment today. It will not be a long time, therefore, until Armageddon. Those who have come to know the Lord can do as commanded: “ ‘Shout with joy, and rejoice, 0 daughter of Zion! For lo, I am coming to dwell in the midst of you,’ is the oracle of the Lord. Many nations will attach themselves to the Lord on that day; and they will become his people, and he will dwell in the midst of you; and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you. And the Lord will take possession of Judah.” (Zech. 2:10-12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font5"> Do you believe it? Will you tell others what you know? Will you show patience and endurance while telling them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a hard thing for an individual to make up his mind as to what he wants to do: stay with this old, dying world with its wealth, pleasures and present popularity; or, as he puts it, “take a chance” on the new world. Will you who know God and who are acquainted with his Word show your faith by good works? When one studies and knows the Word of God and believes that Word, it is not a matter of taking a chance. It is a matter of being sure what the outcome will be. If you are sure, you will try to convince others who are ready to pull away from Babylon. If one flees from the old world and from the nations that are spoiling him, just what will the outcome be? Primarily it means the individual will be in line to receive everlasting life. He will have the opportunity of worshiping the Most High God, his Creator, for eternity. But in order to receive the blessings of this life he must accept the Son Christ Jesus; for the scripture says whosoever believes on Him will be able to get everlasting life. Are you, as a Christian, going to help him learn these things? It will not be easy; it will take patience and time on the part of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of us must remember we are living in an old world, the world that is opposed to the establishment of God’s kingdom. It has been opposed to the Kingdom for centuries. Even when the King Christ Jesus was upon the earth and did his wonderful preaching, the nations of the world saw to it that he was put to death and destroyed by being staked. He died as a condemned sinner, as a seditionist, a man against the Roman rule of Caesar and a man hated by the very religious Jews who were seeking the Messiah. He was one who went through great persecution. It was not easy for the King Christ Jesus to live in this old world. He knew they were out to kill him, and they finally did, but that did not scare him. He had his work to do and he did it to become the greatest witness of all time in favor of the name and word of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful followers of Christ Jesus must take a similar course. There are no two ways about it. They must be for Jehovah’s kingdom. They no longer want to be spoiled by the nations and come under their subjection; so they flee this old world of Babylon with its devilish rule and place themselves under the rulership of the King of heaven, Christ Jesus, who they know now rules in the heavens. He was placed upon his throne by Jehovah God and made ruler in 1914.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>A GREAT CROWD ANNOUNCING THE KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What a marvelous thing has happened! Today we find a great crowd of people who have listened to the message of the Kingdom and who are saying, “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” (Rev. 19:6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font5">Yes, the time has eome for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who have fled from the Babylonish organization recognize that Jehovah has become king by placing his Son upon the throne to rule in the midst of his enemies. This is a day in which to rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early days of the church Jehovah God through his holy spirit or active force gave power to the apostles to perform miracles, and this attracted many people to the message and to what the apostles were saying. However, these special or miraculous gifts came to an end with the death of the apostles, and we do not see them in operation at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will remember the account in Acts 14 where the apostles Paul and Barnabas -were preaching the good news and they had performed a miracle. After seeing the marvels done by these men, the people wanted to make them gods; for they thought that the gods of heaven had eome down to the earth and had become men. “However, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their outer garments and leaped out into the crowd, crying out and saying: ‘Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human creatures having the same infirmities as you do, and are declaring the good news to you, for you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them.” (Acts 14:14,15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> Paul and Barnabas did not take credit for doing this miracle themselves. They knew it was done by the power of God, so they gave all the honor to him. They told those surrounding them that the one who backed them up in doing this miracle was the Creator of heaven and earth, and as for themselves they were just mere ordinary human creatures. Their whole purpose in preaching and performing the miracle was to turn the people toward the only true God and for nothing else. They wanted to show the people that their heathen gods in the temples where the Gentiles offered sacrifices were not living gods worthy of worship. It was the truth from God’s Word that they were contrasting with false religion. Even though sincere and honest and trying to do the people good, they were greatly persecuted and hounded by them at other places on their travels because of miracles they performed and especially because of the message they preached. Nevertheless, the truth found a sure foothold in those early days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it is today with the ministers of the gospel. The good news is still being preached, and while they do not have the power to perform miracles, they do have from God the power and the commission to preach this gospel unto the ends of the world. The Lord’s people have been delivered from the Babylonish organization and from the nations that spoiled them. Because they fled from these organizations they are tormented by Babylonians. Oh, yes, they are still in the world, but they are no longer a part of it. They have come to the unwalled city under Jehovah’s protection and they know that “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus, regardless of oppression, will pursue righteousness and godly devotion. They will stand up against all the opposition that is brought to bear against them, because they know that even as Christ and the apostles were persecuted and were permitted to go through many trials and tribulations; so even today they must do likewise, and it is only by endurance that they will be able to gain the victory. It is the aim of Jehovah's witnesses to help the people, therefore they eannot give up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Paul wrote to Timothy, he pointed out that we must have faith, love and endurance and must continue in our preaching work with mildness of temper. We are not to get angry and rant and rave as the peoples of the nations of this old world do. We are not to act as their chief representatives do in the conferences of the United Nations. The loud, abusive talk at election time is typical of their lack of love for one another. Christians cannot share in that kind of speech. It is unbecoming. Rather, with a steady, faithful love and devotion they must show their endurance with a mild temper. This kind of disposition they will be able to use when talking to the people in the world, and they will be able to persuade all kinds of people to listen to the message that they have. They may not be proud or haughty, nor do they feel that they are better than anyone else. In order to contend for the victory in this contest of faith, they must preach the Word in a manner pleasing to God and in a manner that will attract the people who are seeking after truth and righteousness. Is it not the desire of God to see all kinds of men saved? and do not Jehovah’s witnesses feel that way about it, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul said, “Contend for victory in the right contest of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you declared the right confession publicly before many witnesses.” (1 Tim. 6:12, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> So then, in order for a Christian to contend for the victory in the right contest of the faith, he must make a public confession and tell all kinds of people what he believes. Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide are doing just that, and the results in the past six years show the great blessing of Jehovah. Below is set out the number of Kingdom publishers or ministers who have been proclaiming the message of the Kingdom every month throughout the years men-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tioned. The last figure shows the increase in number of publishers over the previous year.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">It is noted that during the last three years there has been an increase of approximately 49,000 ministers preaching the Word every year. In other words, 49,000 persons have been coming out of the old world each year, taking a definite stand for God’s kingdom and making proclamation of this stand publicly before many witnesses. In this way they are contending for the victory. While they have had many trials and difficulties, “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and he who touches one of these witnesses touches the pupil of his eye. Jehovah loves their faithfulness, and he gives the increase! Are you having a share in it?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>MEASURING THE VISIBLE PART OF THE RESTORED CITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The big question that comes up in the mind of many people is, Just how long will it be until the battle of Armageddon? and when will the accomplished end come? How long must I keep on working? The Lord Jesus answers the question in the 24th chapter of Matthew, wherein he says, “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matt. 24:14, AW) Then, as long as this witness must be preached to the nations, the end will not come. It is quite evident that there are thousands upon thousands of people who have not yet been given ample opportunity to take their stand on the side of the Kingdom. What shall be done? With thousands of people of good will coming to the Lord’s organization and becoming ministers of the gospel after a period of study, and this at the rate of 49,000 a year, one would think that the Theocracy’s increase would be even greater. Could it be greater each year? Is each one consecrated to God getting a firm hold on everlasting life by declaring the right confession publicly ? It is good for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses to carefully analyze his work in line with these questions. What would your answer be in view of what follows?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports have come in from 115 countries, islands, provinces and different territorial divisions of the nations, and we find that there are 328,572 of Jehovah’s witnesses scattered even to the ends of the earth who have been proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom every month throughout the year. That is splendid. They devoted a lot of time to seeing to it that this message was preached. The Society keeps a record of the hours that are spent in preaching the message, and we find that 54,707,445 hours were used during the 1950 service year to preach the Word. This good work of preaching the Word of God has ascended to heaven as a sweet savor in the nostrils of the Lord, and to his servants on the earth it brings satisfaction because we know we have been able for another year to preach that Jehovah is King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people are not interested in just talking to everyone and everybody, although they will; but they are primarily interested in talking to those who have an ear to hear. They go from door to door to find such and then they arrange to call back on those persons who have shown interest. Perhaps someone of the many persons spoken to has obtained a book or a magazine or a booklet, so this interest is followed up. During the year the many thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses made 18,782,972 back-calls on persons interested in God’s Word. As you read the report in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> you will note that many miles were traveled in order to reach these eighteen million people and then these ministers would spend perhaps an hour or more with them, answering their questions on the Bible and bringing the good news from God’s Word to their attention. In addition to making these back-calls it has been found advisable to study regularly with people who really want to learn. So these publishers of the good news have been making 234,952 calls on persons every week, conducting Bible studies in their homes. But is this enough? No. We must help them to get a firm hold on everlasting life and help them to declare the right kind of confession publicly. We want them to know God so well that they will be able to preach to others also, doing so because they want to, not from coercion, but rather because of love for the truth and a desire to see. Theocracy’s increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is observed that in the over-all picture among these 115 nations there has been an 18 per cent increase; or, there were 49,151 more people proclaiming the message of the Kingdom this past year, 1950, than during the year of 1949. That is excellent progress and it shows that many more people have come to renounce unrighteousness, having taken to themselves the name of Jehovah, and being blessed by him in their service toward him. But what can we do in 1951 to improve that activity? If the general trend is to increase, then our individual results must also take an upswing. As we go over the report for last year, we find that sometime during the year each country had a peak in publishers. In other words, a greater number of all those associated with the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide were out in the work in one particular month than in any other month. Adding all these peaks of publishers who were witnesses for the Kingdom, we note that there was a total of 373,430 persons doing ministerial work. If these 373,430 persons engaged in the field service every month, the witness would be tremendous, and the shout that would go forth to the Lord’s praise would be as the voice of a great crowd and the sound of many waters. So it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Revelation 19:6 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font5"> it is stated, “And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: ‘Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king. Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself. Yes, it has been granted to her to be arrayed in bright, clean, fine linen, for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.’ ” It is time now for this great crowd to shout forth the praises of the Most High and declare Jehovah as king, and this sound must be so great that it will appear to be the sound of many waters and as heavy thunder. The questions might be asked by all of Jehovah’s witnesses, Is the sound that is going forth that strong? and, Shall we, by the Lord’s grace, make it that strong ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It cannot be denied that the great multitude of men and cattle are being gathered to this unwalled city. It cannot be denied that we see Theocracy’s increase. It cannot be denied that Jehovah God is protecting his people as though we were under the shadow of his hand. It cannot be denied that this gospel of the Kingdom is being preached world-wide. But, being servants of the Lord, we ask ourselves the questions, Can we do better? Can we do more? Are we finding all of the “other sheep” and aiding them properly? Look over the chart as it is published and observe that 28 countries had a 50 per cent or more increase in publishers. Are we to say that these countries have more “sheep” in them than can be found now in other countries? Or are we to assume that those working in these countries are working more diligently as far as back-calls, Bible studies and house-to-house work are concerned? Are the efforts that they are puting forth in their homelands reaping greater results because of better efficiency, using the time to greater value ? Are they right in the homes with the people, talking to them and studying with them? or are they just standing on the street comer holding the magazines and saying nothing? Are they going from door to door enthusiastically and continually talking to those who have an ear to hear? Is our work efficient? These are questions that we can all propound to ourselves. Then again as we look over all of these countries, we find that 45 countries out of the 115 report at least a 34 per cent or more increase in their publishers in the field on the average every month as compared with last year. We wonder, How can they have such a marvelous increase? Again the same questions might be asked.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>INDIVIDUAL ACTION TOWARD INCREASE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When we look at our task and the results thus far, the 18 per cent increase for all nations on the average is splendid; but if we are going to see Theocracy’s increase as we have never seen it before, what must we do during the year 1951? Individually, we cannot bring in a half a publisher or a third of a publisher, but we can, as publishers of the new world, aid another creature to understand God’s purposes, help him in going out in the work, grounding him well in the truth, and letting him see his privilege of being a minister of the Most High to join in this great shout like that of thunder and sing praises that Jehovah is King. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness a far greater crowd will sing these praises before Armageddon, and Jehovah’s witnesses will share in gathering them. Would it not be well, then, for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses today to try to help at least one person to gain sufficient knowledge of the truth during the coming year so as to aid him to become a regular publisher?

<p><span class="font5">one made it his goal, regardless of in what land, territory, city, village or countryside he lives, the number of publishers would be doubled by the end of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every company will continue to strive for the quota of a 10 per cent increase as it has in previous years, but it should not stop at that. Why not, in addition, have every company, by the Lord’s grace, strive for at least a 34 per cent increase on its peak number of publishers? In other words, let every company take the peak of publishers that it had during last year and add 34 per cent to that and make that your quota for your peak to be reached during your 1951 service year. If every organization, company, country or branch, can accomplish this, it will mean that by the end of 1951 we will have over a half million ministers interested in preaching this good news of the Kingdom. That will mean 500,396 persons, to be exact; surely a great crowd whose voice will sound like many waters and like heavy thunder, proclaiming that “Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can we expect such things to happen as we draw nearer to the battle of Armageddon? There is no reason why we should not, if all the good-will people are to be gathered into God’s organization. Take last year’s Memorial figures for example. There were 511,203 persons who assembled to celebrate the Lord’s death. Why not aid one and all to proclaim him as King? When the prophet Zechariah said, “Thus says the Lord of hosts: Tn those days, ten men, from nations of every language, shall lay hold of him who is a Jew, saying “Let us go with you; for we have heard that God is with you!” ’ ” what did he mean? (Zech. 8 : 23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font5"> He meant a greater crowd would manifest themselves. Ten men would take hold of the skirt of a spiritual Israelite or Jew, a witness for Jehovah, one who is diligent in service and wholly devoted to the Lord, because they will hear “that God is with you”. Will we not then let them hear that God is with us and show them the evidence of it ? It is very essential for us to make proclamation of the Kingdom so that all who will may share in our blessing and rejoice in Theocracy’s increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The company organizations world-wide will be supported by the 14,093 pioneers serving full time in all parts of the world. In this group are found 779 missionaries situated in 79 countries outside the United States of America. With their aid the 34 per cent increase over last year’s peak will be made easier, especially since we have 511,203 persons coming to our Memorial service. The Society is sending out more graduates from its school of Gilead and will continue to do so as long as the Lord provides the funds to support them in their mission fields. They have been trained as are all of God’s servants to help in this great gathering work now going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To accomplish the increase the message of the Kingdom must be taken directly to the people, in the form either of the Bible or of the other publications as we print them. Good work has been done along these lines, for in the year 1950 there were 15,954,418 bound books and booklets distributed along with 17,376,611 magazines </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!),</span><span class="font5"> in addition to the 622,094 year’s subscriptions that were taken. This is feeding the people well with literature, but the question is, Has the proper follow-through been made to bring about Theocracy’s increase? We cannot stop with placing literature, but we must continually and regularly call on the people and study with them. Millions of tracts and handbills were distributed throughout the world. In fact, the Society in all of its printing plants shows a combined total of Bibles, books and booklets printed in the number of 12,650,267. As to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines, this total for the year reached to 46,084,937. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is in position to print more if the demand comes from the field, and nothing would make the members of the branch offices happier than for that to happen. In addition to all this printing there were 242,215,027 other pieces of literature run off the presses, such as handbills, placards used for advertising public meetings, as well as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> letters, letterheads, etc. The literature is available, and as far as the people of the world are concerned the majority of them can be reached with the good news. The responsibility to bring it to them rests with the Lord’s people as they preach the Word, and, by Jehovah’s grace, that they will do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>HOLDING ON FAITHFULLY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses know that long ago the Supreme One of the universe spoke to the faithful men of old, and that he spoke to them by means of the prophets. But now, at the end of this old system of things, he speaks to us by means of his Son, who is his appointed heir of all things. (Heb. 1:1,2) We have a record of what he said and we can study it. Not only that, the greatest event in history has occurred, namely, Christ Jesus has been placed upon his throne and is ruling as Jehovah’s king! He is God’s reflected glory and the exact representation of his being. He is much better than the angels because he has inherited a name more excellent than any of these. If what the angels said happened, more surely will the sayings of the Son of God take place. Certainly we must listen to his commands and do them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is because of the instruction of the Son of God that Jehovah’s witnesses go out and proclaim the message of the Kingdom. Paul said to us, as God’s spokesman, at Hebrews 2:1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(NW):</span><span class="font5"> “That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.” We must keep in mind that the one speaking and giving directions is the only-begotten Son of God. We are to walk in his steps and follow his example, preaching the Word. This is not the time to become lax and indifferent and to think that the battle of Armageddon is far away. “The time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29, AW) He revealed to the apostles the sign of the end of this world and of his second presence, and we have proof that he is invisibly here. One of the marks of his presence is the great preaching work. Therefore, it is necessary for Jehovah’s servants on the earth to be more diligent than ever concerning Theocracy’s increase. “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”—2 Tim. 2:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said, ‘Seek you first the kingdom of heaven, and all these things will be added unto you’; so then, we must have this one principal idea of seeking first the Kingdom, and then follow it through to the finish. That is why Paul said to Timothy, “For this very cause I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you through the laying of my hands upon you. For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind. Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord, neither of me a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God.” (2 Tim. 1: 6-8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> We must expect persecution; we may expect imprisonment, even as Paul, who spent time in prison. We may expect to find many faithful even though behind totalitarian iron curtains, forced out of communication with the rest of God’s people. We may expect to find some when we are in concentration camps or scourged by mob violence. This one thing we know for sure: we cannot expect favor from this wicked world, for this old world is not for God’s kingdom. Jesus said, “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 18: 36, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> And we know this, too. We have been warned concerning these conditions, and despite them all we will interest ourselves only in the assembly of the “other sheep”, for this is in vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we are to gather persons of good will into the unwalled city now because it is Jehovah’s time, and that at a rate of 34 per cent increase over the previous year’s peak, Jehovah’s witnesses want to be prepared to take care of them. By the kindness of God his servants have been faithful in the work entrusted to them, and we remember Jesus’ words at Luke 16:10 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font5"> : “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” Those who have taken up the faithful service of the Most High must be faithful in all their work, large or small. The little details relative to house-to-house witnessing are just as essential to faithfulness as the looking after a large company. We have greater work ahead of us, the gathering of a big crowd of the “other sheep”; for they are coming in now in greater numbers than ever before and we must be in position to receive them. Should we cringe back and say it is too much for us when ten people take hold of our garments and demand our time to tell them the truth because they have heard about our God and that he is with us? No! We will be glad they have joined in the song, “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.”—Rev. 19:6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When these thousands, yes, maybe millions, someday come into Jehovah’s unwalled city before Armageddon, he will protect them no matter where they may be on the face of the earth. When the opposers of Jehovah’s kingdom harm one of these his little ones it is like touching the pupil of his eye, for “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. With this assurance Jehovah’s witnesses press on in the grand work of preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom, all to his honor and in true worship of our Sovereign Lord.</span></p>

But words are so inadequate and so short-lived that it certainly requires something more than words for one to express his full appreciation to Jehovah God for the blessings and gifts He has bestowed upon the Bethel family in Brooklyn, New York. It was in the service year of 1950 that the new Bethel home and new printing plant were opened and members of the Bethel family moved into these new quarters to push ahead with Theocracy's increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While words of gratitude were said, the only way that we of the Bethel family feel we can make real expression of our appreciation for these two fine structures is by sticking to our work, and that is just what the Bethel family is doing. It is our joy to serve our brethren continually, throughout all the world; and by thus continuing in service to the honor and praise of the Most High God the members of the Bethel family are able to express their gratefulness to their God in heaven for all the wonderful gifts they have received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was on Monday, January 30, 1950, that the dedication exercises of the new Bethel home took place, and this new building was devoted to the service of the Most High God. What was said that night by the various speakers was heart-cheering and warming. It marked the start of a new way of life in the Bethel home for many, because it brought the Bethel family together again as one group. Many of the members were living in other quarters, but from this time forward they began moving over into the new structure to enjoy the new living rooms that had been built for their comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just two months later another outstanding event occurred in our process of moving and arranging things so the home would operate smoothly. It was at that time that we occupied our new Bethel dining room. It certainly was a pleasant occasion for all the members of the family to be able to sit down at the tables in the dining room and discuss the Scriptures and talk to one another about the good things the Lord had done for us. On April 3, 1950, we used these facilities for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This day was marked also by the opening of our new factory, another crowning moment in the 1950 service year. It was only a matter of a few months until this fine, new building was equipped with some new machinery, the departments were better organized, and greater production was effected. For the Bethel family, it was the start of grander and better things. We had moved in and were using these buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By this time the offices of the president were occupied; the offices of the secretary-treasurer were being used; the legal department had moved from 117 Adams Street to 124 Columbia Heights; and radio station WBBR had been transferred from Staten Island to fine new studios in the Columbia Heights building. The editorial offices were also established on the 8th floor of the new Bethel building where they adjoined the lovely library. The library’s being nearby makes reference work convenient for the writing staff, as well as being valuable to the brethren of the Bethel family in preparing their discourses and doing their regular study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both the factory and the home were in process of being painted inside and out, and as the rooms were completed the brethren occupied their new quarters. So, by the close of the year everything was in finished shape and being used. Many new pieces of machinery were installed in the factory; while in the home, additional equipment was purchased for the Bethel laundry, hospital, kitchen, tailor and shoe-repair shops. For all of these things we are grateful, and, as stated, it is out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. We do speak words of gratefulness, but we pray that henceforth our works and good deeds to the honor and glory of Jehovah God will be even louder and farther-reaching than our words of appreciation. It is here at the Bethel home at 124 Columbia Heights that brothers and sisters, all consecrated to God’s service, devote themselves without hindrance to the great work of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. The brethren who are occupants of this home are glad to be the servants of their coworkers world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More so than ever the members of the family in Brooklyn feel closely tied in with all of the branch organizations, for it was during this year that the branch servants and representatives from 67 different nations were able to live, talk and work with members of the Bethel family. We feel close to the Lord’s people everywhere, and we know of their great love for this place. Their love is not for a structure, a building or a monument. It is their love for the work which is being done at this place and their love for the brethren who are doing it that has created such wonderful unity and co-operation among the peoples of every nation, kindred and tongue. We are as a new nation without separating boundaries. The New World society knows no divisive force or hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Toward the close of the service year the brethren at the Bethel home put in much extra time in preparation of the great assembly of the Lord’s people which was to take place during August. Untiringly and diligently everyone worked to take care of the great number of visitors staying in the Bethel home. Additionally, there was much to be done at the factory in the way of printing publications to be released at the assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>THEOCRACY’S INCREASE ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the year was the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, held July 30 through August 6, 1950, in New York city’s huge Yankee Stadium. The New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses, aided by many companies in New Jersey and Connecticut, worked diligently for months preparing to house the delegates to this assembly. Many of the Bethel family are servants at the units throughout the city, and they were very happy to share in the work of organizing the brethren for this great task, which they did in addition to taking care of their duties as members of the Bethel family. The entire city had to be covered, house to house, in order to find accommodations for all who made arrangements to come to this wonderful assembly. Prayers ascended to the Lord daily that his blessing would be upon the gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses from the four quarters of the globe, that he would give them spiritual refreshment such as they needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By July 30, the Bethel home and the factory were completed according to plan, and the rooming work that had been undertaken by the New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses was done too. As far as the Bethel home was concerned, we felt as though its walls were bulging because of the number of people we had living in it. But they were our brethren, and we were happy to have them with us. By this time trains, motorbuses, cars, boats and planes were speeding ambassadors of the Lord from all parts of the world toward New York. On July 30 all of us felt as did everyone else: the time of blessedness had begun. Can you imagine! In attendance were 79,247 of Jehovah’s witnesses! From the very opening day of the convention praises were sung to the Most High by a people who spoke the pure language, the language concerning the Kingdom, the language Jehovah’s witnesses want all kinds of persons to learn. All present were students of the Lord’s Word, and all knew that this convention would be a refresher course for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday afternoon when the president of the Society was speaking to the 15th graduating class of Gilead, he was talking not only to them but to all in attendance concerning the fact that “Jehovah is conducting a Government school of success. There is nothing else on earth like it. Since it graduated a Master Instructor [Christ Jesus] it has been in operation for nineteen hundred years. The wonderful course that it offers through him is an education and training for life through all eternity to come. You will not graduate from this school until you have proved yourself worthy of the right to everlasting life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servants of the Most High God, all of whom are students of his Word, wanted to know the way of success. They were there to learn and absorb all the wonderful things that the Lord had in store for them. The things showered upon them at this assembly were more than they could contain at the time. They were in such form, however, that the conventioners could take the releases with them to their homes for study in the year to come. To continue taking in knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son means everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the very beginning of the assembly new publications were released. The first one was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Jehovah's Praise,</span><span class="font5"> and all were overjoyed with the thoughts expressed in the words as well as with the music, which is lively and helps us in expressing our feeling of praise to the Lord. From that time on, one publication after another was released throughout the eight days, until a total of 40 new releases were available, in 17 languages. In fact, there were 142 tons of literature distributed during the eight days of the convention. Outstanding of all the releases was the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. </span><span class="font5">It contains a very accurate translation from the original tongue into the English idiom that the people are using today. It is a joy to the brethren to know that all of the work in connection with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> was done by brethren with hearts and minds wholly devoted to Jehovah and then was printed by consecrated hands in our own plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> was released simultaneously in English and in Spanish on the next to the last day of the assembly, and was enthusiastically received by all in attendance. It is a surety that this book will have a world-wide distribution. It will be an aid to all Christians to lead proper lives while serving the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another happening at the convention which we will never forget was the release of the new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">a 32-page magazine, with new cover design, rearrangement of its material, and more articles pertaining to the great work that the Lord is having done in the earth. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World </span><span class="font5">brought joy to the hearts of all, because the publishers needed something of this kind to help the people who had been taught the evolution theory in schools and colleges. The brethren were delighted, too, with the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News.</span><span class="font5"> This deals not only with the problems of the publishers in the United States as far as legal actions are concerned, but also with the problems of the brethren world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The advertising that was carried on in New York city by the publishers of the Kingdom was very unique. There were placards in the subways and in store windows, large signs in front of many hotels, millions of handbills distributed, brethren calling from home to home—everyone shared in informing the people about the public talk on Sunday, “Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?” The conventioners were not at all ashamed of being associated with this grand group of people, Jehovah’s witnesses, and they did a splendid piece of advertising. The public press was very favorable, especially the two leading newspapers in the city. The radio and television stations gave due announcement of the big, coming event which would draw to a close the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though the final day turned out to be rainy in the morning and cloudy in the afternoon, not only the brethren but also the public turned out to that assembly. 123,707 persons packed out the Yankee Stadium, and filled the cafeteria tents and a number of the streets adjacent to Yankee Stadium, as well as the trailer camp which was located in New Jersey. It was truly an audience to behold, and everyone felt that those in attendance wanted to know how to live forever in happiness on earth. Immediately after this talk, a release of 250,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Eartht</span><span class="font5"> was made and all were immediately distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much more could be said about the assembly—Missionary Day, Branch Day, the discourses given by the various brethren, the 67 nations represented, the colorful post cards, the foreign literature released, the 31 meetings held in the mornings in 20 languages, the convention reports—pages and pages could be written about each one of these features, all to our enjoyment. But the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font5"> of the convention which has been published in brochure form gives 96 pages of details of what really took place. Now we feel sure that the brethren will not droop their hands as they push on with Theocracy’s increase during the 1951 service year. Everyone left the convention on Sunday night bubbling over with joy because of the good things that the Lord had brought to them; but at the same time they left the stadium with a little regret in their hearts because it meant leaving their brethren whom they had learned to love and live with during the past eight days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was like a new world to everyone in attendance, and we had tangible evidence of the New World society. We could see in the faces of all the witnesses a keen desire now to “preach the word” as never before. Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses will ever remain a warm spot in the hearts of all the publishers of this day. They will talk about it for years to come, and the effects of this grand, international assembly of the Lord’s people will be felt even to the ends of the earth. No, the publishers were not anxious to leave, and this was evidenced by the fact that the very next day after the assembly many thousands of persons came through the factory and the Bethel home, desirous of seeing the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. For three days there was a constant flow of visitors. All were welcomed and shown through these places, and happy was their lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years previously at the Cleveland, Ohio, international assembly in 1946, the brethren had made expression that they wanted to aid in some manner in the construction of the new Bethel home and the new factory. They made these buildings possible by financing the project, and it appeared that all were pleased with what had been done. They rejoiced to see the completion of the new Bethel home and the printing plant that furnished them with things needed in their preaching work. They could see that the headquarters organization was efficiently equipped and that the brethren there were anxious and willing to serve them no matter where they might live on the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the whole thing was over, a businessman who had obtained some publications on the street came to visit the Bethel home. He had this to say, “I have seen your people standing on the street with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines, but I did not realize that all of this was in back of them.” Yes, there is a great, visible organization backing up the publishers on the streets and in the homes in all the nations of the world, but even greater than that is Jehovah God with his entire heavenly organization which backs up his earthly servants as they press on in the proclamation of the Kingdom. Theocracy’s increase is on, and we are very grateful to have a part in it, not standing on the sidelines watching it go by, but right in the organization helping with the increase and gathering together those “other sheep” who are sighing and crying because of the abominations that exist in this evil, old world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>CORPORATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., of New York, owns and operates the Bethel home and the factory. This corporation also owns and operates station WBBR and the transmitters on Staten Island. On this same property on Staten Island the Society operates a small farm where fresh vegetables are grown. All excess vegetables from the summer season are canned for winter use by the Society’s canning department. During the season of the year when fruit prices are most reasonable, the Society purchases peaches, pears, plums and other fruits and preserves these for use later in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additionally, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., owns and operates the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, located at South Lansing, near Ithaca, New York. Here ministers are trained for missionary service. Along with this school, the Society operates a large farm where many food products are raised, all of which are used in caring for the family in New York as well as the student body and farm family at Gilead School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, looks after the foreign branch activity and missionaries in many parts of the world. There are other corporations that Jehovah’s witnesses use, such as the International Bible Students Association, established in Britain, and a similar corporation established in Canada. Other local corporations for the directing of the work have been established in Cuba, Brazil and other lands. All of these corporations are servants or instruments used by Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide in the Theocracy’s increase. All the ministers associated with these various corporations are Jehovah’s witnesses. They have the one purpose in view of making known God’s kingdom throughout all the world for a witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>ORDINATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For one to receive ordination from Jehovah God, he must know the Lord’s will. The only way one can ascertain the will of God is to study what he has written. By his holy spirit he inspired men of old to write the things that are now in his Word. All of these things were written beforetime for our learning. An individual with a sincere heart, seeking truth and righteousness, will turn to the Lord’s Word and study it eagerly. If he loves life and wants to carry on the true worship of the Most High, he will sincerely seek to do the Lord’s will, and Jehovah God will bless him with His spirit. A faithful servant of the Lord, being inspired by Jehovah God, wrote, “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.”—Isa. 61:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who make a consecration to Jehovah God accept this charge to preach the message of the Kingdom under the direction of Christ Jesus their King. They know he already has taken to himself his power and begun to reign as King. While Christ Jesus was upon the earth he gave instruction to men, as recorded in the Word of the Lord, and sent them forth to disciple all nations. In turn, these faithful disciples of Christ Jesus instructed other men and directed them to carry on the ministry. Paul wrote to the young man Timothy, giving him advice to look well to the interests of his own brothers and to be the right kind of minister of Jesus Christ. He pointed out to him that he must be nourished with the Word of God so that his faith would be strong. Being nourished with the Word of God meant that he would do the right kind of teaching, which teaching Timothy would himself have to follow closely. Ministers of God cannot be sidetracked by false stories or go over to the traditions of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul wrote a very interesting letter to Timothy, and part of it is quoted here from 1 Timothy 4:11 onward according to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation:</span><span class="font5"> “Keep on giving these commands and teaching them. Let no man ever look down on your youth. On the contrary, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness. While I am coming, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not be neglecting the gift in you which was given you through a prediction and when the body of older men laid their hands upon you. Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that youi* advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While this admonition was given to Timothy by Paul, it is admonition today for every ordained minister of God. Arrangements are made for the ministers of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to carry on regular, orderly study so that they may personally make advancement in their understanding of God’s Word. They must be alert and pay constant attention to themselves and to that which they have learned. Not only that, but they must continue to preach and exhort others to good works. Proving their integrity by preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, they not only save themselves, but afford the opportunity for all of their listeners to be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has appointed many individuals to take up certain duties in various parts of the earth in branch homes, in circuit and district work and in missionary homes. A few of those who are placed in positions of greater responsibility and who hold special appointments from the Society are brethren whose names are listed on the following pages.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is a constantly growing demand for missionaries in most fields throughout the world. The Society is trying to keep abreast of these demands by training ordained ministers for this special missionary work. Jehovah God in his patience did not destroy this old world when he placed his King upon the throne in 1914, and thereby he allowed his witnesses time to preach the Word in many parts of the earth which heretofore had been untouched. Perceiving that there was still much work to be done in proclaiming this message in all the world for a witness, and being keenly interested in Theocracy’s increase, the Society for the past seven years has put forth special effort to get missionaries into countries where the Kingdom message had not been proclaimed; and the Society has added to the missionary forces in countries where the work already had a start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the day the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead was opened, February 1, 1943, to the close of the service year for 1950, a total of 1,563 students were enrolled for special study. Of this number, 1,499 completed the course, qualifying for missionary work. It is very interesting to note that of this group 499 were single men, 474 single women, and 526 were married persons. Looking at it from another viewpoint, of the total who graduated from school, 1,000 were Americans, while 499 were men and women who had come from 37 countries outside the United States. It is not the purpose of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead to train just American ministers, for the Society has brought ministers from all parts of the earth to be trained at Gilead. Bringing these ministers from great distances here to the United States to attend Gilead was made possible by the generous contributions of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of the students who have finished the course at Gilead have learned to love that place, not just because of its beautiful buildings and campus and very pleasant surroundings, but because of the advanced knowledge of the Lord’s purposes they there acquired. Paul stated to Timothy, “Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” No matter who the minister is, he can always improve his service abilities, and that is what the Society tries to do for the ministers who come to Gilead School. We have fine, cheerful classrooms, an outdoor amphitheater for lectures and class demonstrations, an excellent school library with more than 7,800 volumes, and comfortable dormitories suitable for rest and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year, the School graduated its 14th and 15th classes. Concerning the 14th class, the registrar of the school has this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 14th class took residence and began school August 31, 1949. Of the 108 enrollees 41 were ministers from Canada. The remainder were ministers and students from the United States. One of the students from Quebec, Canada, served as an Instructor to teach French to a group of 25 who were being schooled for missionary work in Quebec. The rest of the student body studied the Spanish language. After the normal term of 23 weeks 103 completed the course of study and graduated on Sunday, February 5, 1950. To this lively animated class Brother Knorr delivered his moving graduation talk “Qualifications for Service”. Diplomas were issued to 99 of the 103 graduates. A pleasant surprise was in store for this class when on the Saturday night before their graduation Brother Knorr passed out their foreign assignments. The 103 graduates were to be sent to 22 countries outside of the United States and that as soon as possible after the 1950 New York convention!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The colorful 15th class was made up of 120 students from 32 countries. Their school careers began on February 22, 1950, and concluded with their graduation at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, July 30, 1950. This proved to be the first of 15 classes where the number who entered school succeeded in being the number of graduates. Thus all 120 became graduates after five months of earnest studying and theocratic polishing. Of these, 117 received diplomas. In preparation for particular expansion In Brazil one of the students from Brazil was asked to become an Instructor in Portuguese and successfully taught one whole group of 29 fellow classmates in this foreign tongue. Two other groups of 30 each were taught Spanish and a fourth was offered a course in advanced English. Like the 14th class, these brethren too received their foreign assignments before graduation and were being assigned to missionary fields in the four corners of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a departure from the school’s general practice, in this year for the first time a Gilead graduation was held far away from the home campus. And what a graduation it turned out to be! Before an audience of 79,247 persons attending the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, July 30, Gilead graduated its 15th and largest class, 120 from 32 nations. Friends, relatives and guests from 67 countries assembled for this blessed event to extend their congratulations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Our report would not be complete without mentioning how happy the staff here at Kingdom Farm have been in receiving the thousands of convention visitors. Young and old from scores of countries roamed about the large 700-acre premises of the Society to see all that there was to be seen. Gilead truly has become an international curiosity and interest. Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses wanted to be eyewitnesses and to breathe some of the atmosphere of the “place where they turn out Gilead missionaries”. It is estimated that about 3,000 visited the campus before the convention and upward of 10,000 after the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead looks forward to another blessed year of Theocracy’s increase and to give its full co-operation toward that end. We give thanks and praise to our heavenly teachers Jehovah God and Christ Jesus for our happy lot and privileges at this school. We will ever look to them and to our mother, the Lord’s organization, for spiritual instruction and understanding. Onward with the tidal wave of Bible truth until its sweet life-giving waters fill the whole earth!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>BRANCHES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, while talking to his apostles concerning the things that would happen at the end of the world, said this: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> In fulfillment of these words, we find Jehovah’s witnesses scattered unto the ends of the earth, preaching the Word of God to the inhabitants of all nations, kindreds and tongues. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society sent out missionaries many years ago to many parts of the world, and it continues today sending out missionaries in even greater number than ever before to try to find people of good will who want to know of God’s Word. Those who have a hearing ear listen with glad hearts and within a short time a company or group of interested persons begin to assemble together to worship the Most High. As they learn of the good things the Lord has in store for them, they too “preach the word”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just as Jesus went from door to door, preaching the gospel and making return visits to those who showed interest, so Jehovah’s witnesses today look well to this activity. Gradually the message of truth has reached out in this manner unto the ends of the earth. In order to keep all of this great organization together, the Society has established branches in various</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">parts of the earth. A list of these branch offices, of which there are now 61, appears on the last page of this book. Each branch looks after certain territory assigned it by the president’s office. The territory includes the country in which the branch is located and in some cases nearby countries and islands that are conveniently located so the branch office can send representatives to visit the publishers of the Kingdom living there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within this territory the branch office looks after the establishment of company groups, takes care of the interests of the pioneers, arranges for circuit servants to visit all the companies regularly and also appoints a district servant to make regular visits to the circuit groups. The branch office handles requests for literature and Bibles, and carries on correspondence within its territory with companies and pioneers. If it seems advisable to establish missionary homes in branch territory, the headquarters office in Brooklyn arranges to send missionaries to that territory. Then the missionary homes come under the direction of the branch. Pioneers, companies, missionary homes—all publishers preaching the good news of the Kingdom —make reports to the branch office. In turn the branch office makes monthly reports to the president’s office, where the figures are tabulated. Thus Jehovah’s witnesses have a good idea of what is being accomplished throughout the world as far as Christ’s instructions are concerned that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth”. It is good for an organization to know in the way of facts and figures what it is doing. Then when the organization sees improvement needs to be made, it can make it. This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> helps Jehovah’s witnesses to get that over-all picture of world preaching by the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is still much to be done. There are many lands throughout the world which are not open to missionaries, but by the Lord’s grace the Society will continue trying to send missionaries to such territories so that all people, whether held under the bondage of pagan religions or any false religion, can be given the opportunity to hear the message of the Kingdom before the final end breaks at the time of the battle of Armageddon. Since we are living in the last days, the Society is very anxious to spread this good news and will continue to establish branch offices in any parts of the world where these seem necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the Society’s service year, August 31, 1950, all of the branch servants send in yearly reports to the president’s office. These are carefully checked, recommendations made for future work, and efforts are made to carry out these suggestions. The reports that follow in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> are from various branch servants, telling us what has happened in their countries in the past year and giving some outstanding experiences. Reports are also given for territories that come under the branch, such as islands or countries in which there are just a few publishers and for which no separate branch organization has yet been established. Readers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> will be interested in these experiences, and they will show you how the work is progressing in the various parts of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible writer Mark, who wrote the second epistle concerning the life of Jesus Christ, started his account in this way: “The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.” He knew what he had to say about Jesus Christ was certainly good news. It was news about eternal salvation and how it was obtainable through Jesus Christ the Savior. Likewise it is the good news of Christ as King that brings comfort to the hungering and thirsting people of today. The writer Matthew said, “Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.”—Matt. 5:6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is making every provision for filling their needs and satisfying their hunger and thirst. As all these people of good will feed upon the blessed provisions of the Lord, it brings them real happiness and shows them, too, the blessedness of living as Christians for the New World society. Jehovah’s witnesses in America want to bring this good news to the great population that lives in this very productive land. Sometimes it appears that because of the high standard of living, the many comforts of life, their speed in moving about from place to place, they have no time to consider the Word of God, and that is true concerning the great majority. The inhabitants of the United States are interested very much in personal gain, in trying to get ahead, and the competition is very keen. Their lives are kept so full that, like most people of the world, they feel that a study of the Bible and finding out about their Creator can wait until some later time, usually when they get old and cannot keep up with the hustle and bustle of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But among the 150,000,000 people living in the United States there are many thousands who have tired of the promises held forth by politicians. They are very much dissatisfied with the false religious teachings. They have become weary trying to keep up with the commercial world, and now they are listening to what the Bible has to say about eternal life and living it in peace and quietness. Good increases have been made in the growth of the witness work in the United States of America during the past twelve months, and it brings joy to the hearts of all fellow witnesses throughout the world to see the great advances in gathering together these “other sheep”. What has happened in the United States in the past twelve months should convince everyone that the work is not finished in his own country. When 16,000 new publishers of the Kingdom begin preaching the gospel in a nation within twelve months, it makes one stop and ask, Is the work finished as far as preaching the good news is concerned? Certainly not! Because if 16,000 came in during this year, how many more thousands can come into the truth in the remaining few years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With more ministers in the field, undoubtedly more people will be reached, more time can be devoted to home Bible studies and making calls on those who have shown interest in the Kingdom; so the end is not yet, but we are rapidly approaching to the accomplished end. In the United States there is still much to be done, as is true throughout all parts of the earth. Not only does the United States branch office have the interest of all the companies at heart and look after the thousands of pioneers who serve this land, but the branch office in America also prepares millions of books, booklets, Bibles and magazines for use here and by the Society’s branches in other lands. The report by the branch servant for the 1950 service year tells us what has happened in the factory and in the field, and from it we shall see how Theocracy’s increase is taking place in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Heartfelt appreciation toward a righteous God grips one as he dwells upon the great prosperity of the theocratic activity at the Watchtower factory and in the field service of preaching the Word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the factory the crowning moment of the 1950 service year occurred in late winter, when the building contractors for the new factory said “Finished 1” Beaming with jubilation and thanksgiving to our righteous Master and Provider, we Immediately swung into motion a program of occupation. Being organized beforehand, it was a matter of only a few months until this grand new building was performing its dedicated purpose of praising Jehovah. Expanding out into this approximate 90 per cent increase of floor space provided urgently needed room for more efficient production in the old section of the factory. While the floor space was being occupied, 2,280 gallons of paint was being applied to the interior and exterior of the entire factory building. All this was being accomplished by our own brethren from the factory force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By Jehovah’s grace and the willingness on the part of the Bethel family to work extra hours evenings and Saturday afternoons for a period of two months, It was possible to complete the painting and occupancy of the new factory by convention time. This had been set as a goal so our brethren coming to New York for the convention could see their new factory doing what they wanted it to do. Speaking on behalf of the Bethel family of the United States branch, I can thankfully say it certainly filled our hearts with joy to be visited by 35,081 appreciative brethren the first three days after the convention. Particularly interesting was the first day as 28,142 swarmed through the factory. A sight to behold, and a rare one indeed, as factory visitors standing from two to eight abreast formed a waiting line 16 blocks long. At 5: 00 p.m. of that day it almost seeped as If Jehovah had performed a miracle as the last ones of the line had entered the factory doors. Hence every one of this great number had shared in the mile-long trek through the factory, flanked continually by humming production lines singing Jehovah’s praise. It thrilled all the visitors to know that they were part of it, and I am sure each one departed strengthened for greater activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All eight floors of this factory tie in directly floor by floor with the old section. This makes for unbroken, efficient manufacturing. However, the new section of the factory is one floor higher than the old. Hence the facilities of good light, quietness and isolation from the manufacturing floors that the ninth floor has are excellently employed for housing the general office. It is from this office that field service throughout the United States Is directed. During the past year the brethren working in this general office received and handled 387,382 pieces of mail. In conjunction therewith, they at the same time prepared and dispatched 261,565 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Holding first interest in the way of new equipment in the new factory is the recently installed 46-ton high-speed rotary printing press. This new press is especially constructed for the printing of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines. It is capable of producing 29,000 magazines per hour. What thought does this cause to flash to your mind? Why, increased magazine production and distribution. The past year’s production clearly indicates this definite trend. Notice the astounding increase: There were 2,090,454 more copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and 2,321,565 more of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> sent out of the factory this year than during the previous year, an increase of 4,412,019 magazines in one year, reaching a grand total of 34,010,355 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines mailed out of the factory during the 1950 service year. Surely now, equipped with a new magazine press, both magazines standardized in size, a new spacious factory and a devoted, ever-increasing, efficient field organization for dis-trlbution, the coming years should witness a tremendous expansion in magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1946 Jehovah’s witnesses expressed their uncompromising stand for the supremacy of Jehovah God by producing a book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> It proved to be an effective instrument for conveying happiness to those hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Even in its fourth year it is still a very timely, widely used publication, and Its production during this past year alone came within 22,447 copies of reaching one million. Each of you who had a part in distributing or studying this book will doubtless rejoice to know that thus far its production has rocketed to a grand total of 8,733,000 copies. Not to one language nor to one country is the preaching of the Word by this book confined. No, It reaches world-wide, as indicated by its being published at the factory in 24 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For your convenience in grasping quickly an over-all picture of the factory’s total production, a condensed report for the past three years is here submitted:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">I would like to make a few observations on the above chart. For instance, the paper used for the 1950 production listed above exceeded that used in any previous year by totaling 3,415 tons. Another point, the greatest thing we have to give the good-will people is God’s Word. It is gratifying, therefore, to have produced 273,505 Bibles this year, to compare with 70,437 in 1949. Surely this figure will be exceeded next year and In years to come, now that we have been equipped with the priceless </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> which was released at the New York convention, and is published solely by the Watchtower factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the above has been produced in the United States, Its effect is not limited domestically. Corroborating this is the fact that the above literature was published in 42 languages. Furthermore, over half, or, to be exact, 55 per cent of the books, Bibles and booklets were exported to lands outside the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is cherished privileges as those mentioned above of serving not only our American fellow praisers of Jehovah but those in all lands that make our Kingdom service as a Bethel family so rich. We here have been filled to overflowing with gracious provisions from Jehovah. It is our sincere desire at the United States branch to effectively use this bountiful equipment to praise our ruling King Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">While we were enjoying extensive expansion and increased theocratic activity at the factory, all sharing as ministers In the field were side by side with us also enjoying an increase as a result of faithful planting and watering. Enthusiasm ran high from the very outset, for the newly established quota of 91,254 publishers for the coming year had already been exceeded by a peak in August, which closed the previous service year. United efforts to reach a December peak were rewarded by an October peak of 93,561 publishers. Spurred on by this manifestation of Jehovah’s blessing and the hope of reaching 100,000 publishers preaching the Word during one month by the time of the international convention, the publishers not only reached a new peak in December but made it the first of 5 consecutive peaks: 95,086 in December; 95,292 in January; 96,001 in February; 100,717 in March; 108,144 in April. What an unexcelled victorious march of praise, motivated by the spirit of the God of increase! The result of united efforts in preaching the Word for the year was a monthly average of 98,468 publishers, or 7,214 above the set quota. This meant a gratifying increase of 18.7 per cent over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event of the year was, of course, the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly, held July 30 through August 6, 1950, In New York city’s gigantic Yankee Stadium. Even these spacious facilities were taxed to overflowing as tens of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses gathered from the four corners of the globe for spiritual refreshment, fellowship and Instruction. Starting at tlie record-breaking number of 79,247, the attendance swelled to 123,707 who heard the public talk, “Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?” A complete record of this assembly has appeared in a special 96-page </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font4"> and the October 1, 1950, issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back-calls are now being made on thousands of people who had witnesses in their homes in New York city or who attended some of the convention sessions. A similar upsurge of interest Is reported across the breadth of the nation as the result of witnessing done en route to the convention and the favorable reports on the assembly that appeared In scores of local papers and national magazines. Certainly the International convention was a fitting conclusion to a happy service year, a year marked by increases in almost every possible respect. While the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly was the outstanding field service event of the year, there were many other interesting happenings, and a few of these are related, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While serving a company in South Dakota, a circuit servant contacted a man who was superintendent of a Protestant church and chairman of the Council of Protestant churches in Poland. He was touring that part of the country giving lectures on “Why I Left the Catholic Church” and seeking aid for the Polish war orphans. In the discussion this man said that he was once a Catholic priest but broke away when he saw the hypocrisy. For this he was sorely persecuted. During World War II he spent three months in a Nazi concentration camp where he became acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses, saw how they were mistreated, and greatly admired their strong faith in God, for which he praised them. After the war he attended some of the district assemblies in Poland and said he enjoyed assembling with Jehovah’s witnesses because he knew God was with them. He gladly took literature and promised to attend the public lecture Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This man kept his promise, came for the public talk and remained for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, which he greatly enjoyed. Later he was called upon to relate some of his experiences with Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland. He readily responded, his talk being a stirring service talk in which he urged the brethren to continue In their wonderful work of comfort and soundly denounced religious leaders who are largely responsible for the world’s present state. He afterwards remained with the brethren for about two hours, in all of which time he made no mention of his war relief efforts, and expressed the hope that he would be able to attend the New York convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, Interesting experiences almost without number were enjoyed by the brethren coming to and returning home from New York. One sister relates that on their train coming to New York were 180 Japanese students who were in this country to study “Freedom and Democracy”. The witnesses were told not to discuss religion with them, but somehow or other all things led to a discussion of the Bible! These students took much literature, and one girl said she believed it was a provision of Jehovah the Creator that they should come to this country early and have the privilege of traveling with the witnesses to Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Circuit assemblies have had the enthusiastic support of the brethren following the New York convention. It has been found that attendance is larger, more brethren are being baptized and greater Interest is being manifest by outsiders, including the local newspapers which frequently send reporters to get information, whereas in the past they had studiously avoided any mention of the assemblies. At one such assembly recently, a man was noticed taking a seat at tlie extreme rear of the auditorium. He explained to an usher that he didn’t want to go up farther, as he wanted to be able to get out quickly In case it wasn’t very interesting. Before the talk was over he was applauding as enthusiastically as anyone in the hall. Another visitor was a lady who had been going by the building on the way to a church bingo party. Noticing the activity she inquired about it from an usher and decided to spend the afternoon more profitably. Afterward she expressed her appreciation to the usher and obtained literature from him. A third “stranger” at this assembly was a local educator who is also associated with the Intelligence department. He too was enthusiastic and was talking about next year's conventions in Europe. Truly the Kingdom message is reaching &quot;all kinds” of people here in the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With confidence and joy we look forward to further blessings from the hand of a benevolent Creator as we steadfastly seek to share in the increase of his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>LEGAL DEFENSE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Another year has passed with the missionary field—door-to-door and street—free from wholesale invasion by the enemy. Yet the hatred of the demons shows up in their earthly supporters. It still remains. Manifest it is in the few encroachments on freedom of worship now reported. There has been wrongful misapplication of ordinances by officials. Mob violence has raised its ugly head in several parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cases have been brought against Jehovah’s witnesses for using the public parks in many towns. They defy the Supreme Court by saying that our use violates the doctrine of separation of church and state. They argue that the Constitution prohibits assistance by the government to be given to a church or religious organization. They contend that the use of a public park by us Is unlawful appropriation of public property as a place of worship In violation of the Constitution. In other words, we are making a church out of the park. This sophistry has been accepted by some courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Counsel for the Society must fight this nefarious doctrine through the courts. It is always necessary to resist any new theory invented in the courts to chisel away the victories that have been given by Jehovah in the long fight over the years past</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new legal booklet released at the international convention in New York city has already proved to be a splendid aid to Jehovah’s witnesses in many troublesome situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 15 places in the world—some islands, others territories, and a few countries—that report directly to the United States branch. There are 547 publishers located in these widely scattered spots, and a brief report is here given concerning each place.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For many years now the pioneers and publishers in Alaska have persistently carried on the witness work against the odds of severe weather, transportation diliiculties and, worst of all, indifference on the part of the people. True, small increases were shown from year to year, but imagine their joy and enthusiasm to know now that the service year closed with a 62.5 per cent Increase in the average number of publishers! During the year an average of 52 publishers reported, to compare with 32 for last year, and during April there was a peak of 72 publishers; evidence that even further progress can be anticipated in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since much of the population is located in scattered fishing villages, two of the special pioneers spent much of the summer traveling from one village to another, placing literature, calling back on those known to have shown previous interest, and arranging, where possible, for other publishers to conduct studies after they had gone on to another village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of their stops was at the Indian village of Metlakatla on Annette island, not far from Ketchikan. Some very good interest was found here and the brethren from Ketchikan, one of the three companies in Alaska, will go there on the weekly boat to care for these sheep.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font4">Passage to Wrangel was arranged at the last minute on a mall boat, then to Petersburg working for passage on a small freighter. By helping on a fish-packer they obtained passage to Sitka, and to get to Cordova, which was next in line, the two brethren worked all night helping to unload a boat, then crawled into their bunks and went along to their destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By this time they had run out of literature; so they worked for their passage back to Anchorage, where they were pleased to learn that as many as 32 persons had turned out for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alaska gives proof conclusive: there is no need to be discouraged. Jehovah gives the increase and provides amply meantime.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Though poor, and work difficult to find, the people of the Azores would manifest greater interest were it not for fear of the clergy and the superstitions of their religion. One person who took booklets returned them later because the Catholic priest told his wife that If he kept them he would not get any clothing from America. So fearful was he of these false threats that he added insulting words to the brother along with the booklets. In the city of Harta Fatal people of good will seek out the witness who is able to visit them occasionally so that he can speak with them and give them comfort from the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many fine opportunities arise to give a witness such as the following example. In a store a witness was approached by an elderly man who was disgusted with the Adventist religion because the preacher had told him he could not eat the meat of a pig he had just killed nor drink wine. He readily accepted Scriptural proof of the preacher’s error. During the conversation a priest came in and injected himself into the discussion. The question of the trinity was raised. The doctrine was refuted and concluded with the point that the word didn’t even appear in the Bible. The priest chided the witness for his ignorance, so he was invited to produce </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> passage. To the surprise of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> large crowd who had now gathered both inside and outside the store, the priest admitted the witness was right! and promptly jumped to the Immortality of the soul doctrine. Confronted with proof that he was wrong in this too he as promptly-changed the subject to communion, but with the same results. The discussion lasted for almost three hours. Murmurs throughout the crowd indicated their secret pleasure at seeing the priest unable to hold his ground and admiration for the witness for his knowledge of the Bible. Undoubtedly in due time many of these truth-hungry people will be numbered among the Lord’s other sheep.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Bahamas are a series of islands, cays and reefs covering an area of approximately 760 square miles. They are inhabited by humble, Bible-loving folks who are proud to have a Bible study in their homes. One of the missionaries reports that she conducts from 20 to 30 home Bible studies a week and keeps a waiting list of others who want studies when she can find time to conduct them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the missionaries there are six local pioneers. One of these is a sister who has been in the pioneer work for over twenty years. She has worked practically all of the islands, reaching them in rickety sailboats and carrying her supply of literature in a bag balanced on her head, the customary way of carrying loads in the Islands. One of the pioneers has recently been working on the island of Exuma, where he has put on some public meetings and has even persuaded schoolteachers and others to help advertise the public talks. In all, 47 public meetings were held in the Bahamas this year, to compare with 10 the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tourist trade furnishes the main means of livelihood Cor the people, and, since the season is not long, they are usually quite poor. Nevertheless, they will spend their last penny for literature if they really want It. The islands are picturesque and are kept so for the benefit of the tourists. Pirate forts are still in existence, a reminder of the days when Blackbeard preyed on shipping with the Bahamas as his base. The coat of arms for the city of Nassau reads in Latin, “Expel the Pirates and Restore Trade.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magazine Day has become a special feature in the Islands and the placements of magazines are excellent. To place 30 magazines in the matter of two or three hours is not uncommon. The people are inclined to offer excuses for not taking a magazine, saying as they go home with their purchases from the market, “I’m spent out.” Placements of individual magazines came up from 5,436 to 12,914, a fine increase over the previous service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Little Bermuda has suffered from the scourge of intolerance and discrimination. Freedom of worship became an empty phrase when Watchtower missionaries were ejected by the Bureau of Immigration despite a petition signed by hundreds of the residents of Bermuda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this past year a second attempt was made to present this petition before the House of Assembly by a freedom-loving member of that body. Sneers, insinuations and false charges were presented in abundance by haters of truth but not one could come forth with evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses are subversive, whether in Bermuda or any other part of the world. A valiant battle was put up by the members of the House who really believe in liberty, and a stormy debate ensued. One must admire such men, none of whom are Jehovah’s witnesses, but who are nevertheless willing to stake their reputations and positions on a righteous cause. Surely Jehovah will not forget the cup of cold water that they are thus giving His servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bather than meet the issue squarely the opposition hedged about for a legal loophole and finally managed to have the petition thrown out as being ‘too old’. Perhaps some of the signers had by this time died! So now the brethren are preparing a new petition, together with additional evidence to place before the House that Jehovah's witnesses are not subversive but are Christians engaged in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom to the everlasting good of those who will hear,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Steady progress has been manifest in the Kingdom work in French Equatorial Africa this past year. Not only has the average number of witnesses increased from 15 to 21, with a peak of 29 in June, but the brethren now have </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization</span><span class="font4"> in the French language, which greatly aided them to properly understand how to carry on the work theocratically. Furthermore, a representative of the Society was able to visit them during the year to give them further instructions and personally assist them in field service, back-calls and studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although there is mucli religion in French Equatorial Africa it is quite apparent that the people are not satisfied with it. The company servant at Dekoa reports, “As soon as we reach a village the people come after us to hear the good news. It is almost unnecessary to go from door to door, except for those persons who cannot assemble themselves.” But why shouldn’t they prefer the truth to the demonism of the Lion- and Leopard-men who still practice their cannibalistic rites in the surrounding jungle and to the empty husks given to them by Protestant and Catholic missionaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The priests and pastors are jittery about the power of the truth. The native witnesses, by the power of the Lord’s spirit, continue to confound the white religious leaders, and as a result their grip on the native population is less sure. On one occasion some of the witnesses were invited to speak before a religious conference. Then to try to counteract the good effect of the words they spoke one of the chief pastors of Oubangui arranged for a subsequent meeting at which he spared no effort to put the Witnesses in a bad light. Each time his questions were answered from the Scriptures and his embarrassment grew with each encounter. To cover his shame he accused the Witnesses and their leaders of being illiterate ignoramuses. They replied by reading 1 Corinthians 1:27,28. Unable longer to restrain himself, this religionist Jumped headlong at the brother to close the Bible from which he read, then cried out to those assembled not to let the Witnesses enter their churches. Acts 17: 24 and John 16:1-3 were read in reply and the witnesses were commanded to “Get out! And those who like to follow the Witnesses go out too!” Thereupon the whole assembly, with the exception of the deacons, stepped out, and as they went they laughed loudly about their pastors who had exposed themselves to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It does not come as a surprise to learn that on July 24, 1950, the Official Journal of French Equatorial Africa published a decree by the high commissioner which prohibits the Introduction, circulation, distribution and sale of all of the publications of the Watchtower Society. What success can they expect in this? “They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Loan, to deliver thee.”—Jer. 1:19.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work In Gambia has been greatly hampered by the lack of a central meeting place and the efforts to try to cause the departure of the two missionaries who have been working at Bathurst Considerable time and effort were expended during the past service year to overcome these difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In mid-April the missionaries were informed by letter from the colonial secretary that they would have to leave Gambia before the close of April because their visas would not be extended beyond that date. No reason was given. It was decided that a personal interview with the governor would be best to determine the cause of the government’s hostile attitude. Although the governor thereupon promised a three-month renewal of visa and further that he would see to it that nothing in the way of Intolerance was practiced against the activities of the missionaries, only a monthly visa renewable monthly was issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The missionaries then circulated a petition among the people which made clear the government’s attitude and the desire they had for permanent residence in Gambia. One hundred and sixteen persons signed the petition. After this petition was submitted to and considered by the governor the missionaries were given permission to remain in Gambia on a quarterly basis with future applications for renewal to be made through the local police department, as everyone else does, Instead of submitting a formal letter to the colonial secretary as they had previously been required to do. The petition gave an excellent witness in the town of Bathurst and the matter was widely discussed among the people, a thing that caused considerable discomfort among the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among other people to be reached by the petition was a young African lawyer who gave his legal services free of charge and who assisted in putting the petition into legal form for presentation to the governor. This young lawyer has since shown a much greater interest in the Kingdom message and has often expressed his keen interest in some of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another person of good will who shows good promise is an African who is the head of the local printing department. Some months ago an order for handbills was placed with him and he gladly obliged by filling the order promptly. The handbills had hardly been in circulation in announcement of the public lecture before a colonial official stormed into the head printer’s office demanding to know why he dared to print for the Watchtower. The printer stood up under the test by saying that he would print for the Watchtower just as long as he printed for the other religious missions. He asked the colonial official if there was any law against printing for the Watchtower, and the official was speechless. He returned to his own office and never mentioned it again to the printer. Since then this person of good will lias made remarkable progress in a home Bible study and he has expressed a desire for a central meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time in the more than a year in Bathurst the missionaries have now been able to locate in a dwelling which is suitable for meetings as well. They are rejoicing in this provision of Jehovah and confidently look for more definite increases in Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Proof that ‘God’s people are willing in the day of his power’ is the faithful little band of publishers in Guadeloupe. There was a time when they felt that the work could no longer go ahead without the assistance of brethren from Gilead. They rejoiced when such help came and were sorry when these missionaries were forced by the government to leave; and although they have continued to look forward to the time when Gilead graduates may once more be among them to help and strengthen and encourage, they have nevertheless continued to preach the gospel the best they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such conscientious effort on the part of even the poorly equipped of his servants does not go unnoticed by Jeho</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vah. He </span><span class="font4">gives the increase in other parts of the earth and he gave an increase in Guadeloupe too, for the average number of publishers went up from 35 to 43 in the course of a year. A peak of 52 company publishers was reached in August. This increase of 22.9 per cent Is excellent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps it will yet be possible for more assistance to be sent to these brethren, but in the meantime they will continue to hold high Jehovah’s name and advertise his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">An event of outstanding interest for the publishers in Iceland this past service year was receipt of 5,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> in Icelandic. Long had they looked forward to having a suitable textbook for use in holding Bible studies in the predominant language of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new book was readily placed in the field even though the people are quite indifferent to studying the Kingdom message. Oftentimes a person will listen for a few minutes and then give as his only reply, “Yes, that is your opinion, and it is interesting to listen to what other people have to say.” It had been hoped that with this new textbook it would be possible to start many studies, but indifference continued to be a major hindrance. Even so, an average of ten studies were conducted monthly during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One young man who began to study the truth last winter made such progress that he decided to attend the international assembly in New York. While there he was baptized and he has now taken a firm stand for the truth. He is eager to advance theocratic interests and has assisted some with translation work in Iceland. A peak of nine publishers was reached in August. Three of these were pioneers and two are special pioneers serving as missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public meetings were begun this year, first in the home with only interested persons and then in the town of Reykjavik, where as many as 89 attended. Quite a few representatives of various sects and denominations were present but they quickly and quietly disappeared after the meeting. In all, seven public meetings were held, including the Memorial celebration with an attendance of eight, one of whom partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This summer other parts of Iceland besides Reykjavik have been worked. One couple went to some small islands to the south of the main island. They took about 300 books along and in a week all of them were placed. Next these two pioneers went north to the second-largest town, Akureyrl, a place of 7,000 inhabitants. They pitched their tent on a hill next to a high school. When a heavy rain came that evening the caretaker of the school invited them to use a classroom. They accepted and had the use of it for their entire stay </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4"> two weeks. During that time they placed their entire supply of 500 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is believed that many of these books are in the hands of people who will read them during the winter. Since Icelanders are quite self-reliant and like to “find out for themselves”, it may be that some will be sufficiently curious to read and thus learn the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Even though the missionaries are not in Korea at this writing we would like to give a retrospective review of the work done there for the first 10 months of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year opened with the first complete month of field service reported in almost 11 years. A new peak of 21 company publishers was reached. The few Korean booklets on hand were rationed out for the purpose of lending to the people of good will. The brethren were pleased with the home Bible-study work, which was new to them. In November, when the first sizable shipment of literature arrived and the brethren could once again offer booklets in the house-to-house work, the brethren were overjoyed. This was reflected in December’s report, when a new peak of 28 publishers averaged 30 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that literature was on hand some of the brethren began to think seriously of pioneering. By the first of February fully one-fourth of the company had entered the pioneer service, four beginning in January and three in February. Two of them had pioneered before the ban by the Japanese. One of these, a sister, had been imprisoned by the Japanese for seven years. Her husband had died in prison. Now she is again in the full-time service and her zeal is second to none. Sometimes she puts in 14 hours a day, not even stopping to eat. Though she is required to put in only 100 hours a month, recently she reported 234 hours. The hospitals, universities and other institutions respected this sister and the professional people would stop and listen to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Korean brethren work under difficult conditions. I-ack of food, clothing and transportation still hamper them, but one wouldn’t know it by their cheerful attitude. They constantly practice the Christian principle that “godliness with contentment is great gain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young woman from a well-to-do family was finishing her college education to become a Christian social worker. She had the money granted to her and in the bank for an American education. Her mother heard of the truth and was interested enough to come to the meetings. The daughter, who speaks English well, came along one Sunday to find out about this strange message. If Christ’s second presence began in 1914 she wanted to find out about it, she said. One of the Gilead graduates arranged a study with her for the next day. She skipped school to attend. She came every day that week, talking to any of the missionaries she could and began service herself before a week was out. The second week she resigned from college and since has been working faithfully until she can qualify as a pioneer. This young woman gave up something that is considered to be one of the greatest assets in Korea—an American education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Korea the company meetings were well attended. Usually two or three times the number of publishers in the company were present. In April when the theocratic ministry school was started, the lack of a textbook in Korean was overcome by the instruction talk’s being interpreted each week by a young college professor. This required the brethren to take extensive notes on the talks in order to be able to answer the review questions the next week. It was a wonderful sight to see the 90 or 100 pencils going furiously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spring of the year the public meetings were started by means of interpretation. After the attendance grew to 162 it was decided that the home could not accommodate the public meetings, so effort was made to find a hall outside. The government made a special concession in our behalf and allowed us three meetings in a fine school auditorium. The first of these meetings was scheduled for .Tune 25. The Korean War started that day, but because the Seoul inhabitants were not told of the significance of the happenings until after the rest of the world knew the first meeting was held without incident. 336 persons attended this meeting. As the speaker finished a police officer came in and announced that the country was at war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The subsequent fall of Seoul, the unexpected evacuation of the Gilead missionaries and the terrible sufferings Inflicted on our brethren left behind have interrupted the reports of the work being done in Korea. The last conversation had with the brethren was to the effect that this time they would not stop preaching. We are sure they have lived up to that statement and we look forward to the time soon when we can go back to our assignment in Korea and aid the brethren and hear their report of their steadfast preaching under the most difficult of circumstances.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The past service year got off to a somewhat slow start but in January 1950 the Society sent out another Gilead graduate. He immediately set about to aid the local brethren, not only in their field activities, but encouraging them to become more and more theocratic organization-minded, to study, prepare themselves for the time when there might not be any foreign brethren here to assist them to carry on this work of gospel-preaching. Then on April 24 two more Gilead graduates joined us temporarily. They too started right out to build up the present company organization as well as seek new ones not already associated. So now for the past few months the Lord’s blessing can be seen upon our efforts. Some of the publishers seem fired with new zeal. Those enrolled in the ministry school are making splendid progress, door-to-door presentations are better, comments on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> as well as In other meetings are becoming clearer and more concise, and Jehovah is giving an Increase in number of publishers, all to the honor and praise of his great name and for which we are humbly grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people here manifest a real appreciation for the magazines, especially the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> It is nothing strange for someone to stop you on the street and ask for the latest copy, or when in magazine work to have one say, “Oh, I am a subscriber for that magazine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan the adversary uses many subtle means to try to discourage the Lord’s sheep as persons of good will. A local pioneer sister who speaks the Bassa dialect fluently assisted an old man to come to a knowledge of the truth. He is about 90 years old. While in Monrovia he attended all the meetings faithfully, walking three miles to the Kingdom Hall. Some of his religious friends chided him, saying, “Old man, why do you go to them meetings? You don’t know what them people are saying.” To which he replied, “Well, I can’t hear (understand) what they say, but God knows I am there.” And so he continued to come and sit through all the meetings smiling and looking just as happy as though he understood every word. Jesus said, ‘If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me.’ His servants in Liberia as in all parts of the world sing forth his praise through the “faithful and wise servant” and his spirit is manifest as we see persons of good will from all lands being drawn to his visible organization, mankind’s only hope.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>MARTINIQUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">On August 9, 1949, a group of four missionaries landed in Martinique at the capital city, Fort-de-France. To start out from door to door with the Bible In the French language, being able to speak only a half dozen words of French, really took faith. However, the missionaries could read a few verses from the Bible or a little from the publications they presented to the people, showing the Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. While this was rather difficult, the missionaries knew the people needed the truth more than anything else, and, by the Lord’s grace, they were there to learn the language quickly and help the people get the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many are the experiences of these missionaries with the people in Martinique. When they receive their rolls of French magazines, they would go to the street corners or the market place and there offer them to the people. It wouldn’t be long before a crowd would assemble and propound many questions, all of which gave them opportunity to place the literature. Finding so many people interested in the Bible and Bible teachings disturbed the priest, who then called the gendarmes, and they took down the information as to who these people were. From that time on these missionaries were watched very closely in their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One man was found who had heard the truth 40 years ago. He had read Pastor Russell’s books, but for quite some time he had lost track of the organization. Now he was very glad to again meet with Jehovah’s witnesses. He is now studying and talking to the people in his business. Another time a young lady stopped two of the missionaries and said, “I was in New York last week, and your people were on every street corner with the magazines. They were having a convention.” “How did you know us?&quot; asked the missionary. “Oh, everybody knows you people,” she answered, and then inquired where our meetings were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">News soon got around the island that some missionaries had entered and were telling the people about God’s kingdom and a new’ world arrangement where peace and prosperity will reign. This the Catholic clergy and the Protestant ministers object to because it starts the people thinking, and one thing the Catholic Church does not like is for their people to think. It is quite evident that the clergy have had great influence with the police and the governmental authorities. So on July 7 notice was received from the local government that the missionaries should be ready to leave Martinique on the first of the new year. No reason for this action was given. An effort was made to see the prefect, but the brethren were brought to the secretary-general. After witnessing to him and explaining the work, he suggested that they write to the prefect and explain our work. This was done, but the answer was the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently the old prefect was relieved of his position and a new prefect was put into office. He gave the brethren tlie opportunity to speak to him about their problem. What the outcome will be is unknown. Many of the people on the island when they learned that the missionaries would have to leave, said, “The church is behind this.” They understood that the witnesses had been denounced from the pulpits by the priests and the Baptist preachers. The Catholic press has carried on a campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses. However, it is believed that the preaching of the gospel will continue even though these missionaries are sent away from the Island. Some seed has been planted on good soil, and the brethren there are continuing to cultivate and water it. We hope that within the next few months a few of the natives will be strong enough to take up the truth and keep on preaching It.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Like our brethren in many other countries of the world, those living in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan find conditions difficult as the adversary increases the pressure in his attempt to turn all men away from God. Following a pattern set by the taskmasters of ancient Egypt, the wealthy take unfair advantage of the poor, and our brethren are among those who must toil from dawn until dark at very low wages in order to earn enough to buy bread. Extreme physical exhaustion adds to their burden, since they must force themselves against the weaknesses of the flesh to study the Bible, which is so essential to those seeking eternal life. The prevailing hardships and poverty cause many to blaspheme and turn away from God. It is reassuring, therefore, to find that there was a 50 per cent Increase in the average number of publishers over the previous service year. Surely It makes the heart of the Creator glad to see his servants turning the Devil’s challenge back into his face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are now five organized companies, to compare with two for the previous service year. At two of these, Beit-Jala and Ramalla, the Memorial was celebrated with a total of 47 attending and 12 partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Steady work is almost Impossible to find and time is lost seeking another job, so the people are usually financially unable to contribute for the literature. But, even so, the brethren are happy to be able to bring words of comfort to those who mourn despite the present conditions. In doing this 209 home Bible studies were conducted on an average each month, a splendid Increase from only two the year before! Surely there will soon be many more witnesses of God in this land as these sheep are fed, grow strong and help to shoulder the burden of reaping the harvest of men of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It Is with joy that we note a 60 per cent increase in the average number of publishers in Portugal despite the llmi-tation placed upon the work by the government. The average number of publishers during the year was 48, but a new peak of 58 was reached in July. This includes the country’s one pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the Society is not recognized in Portugal, it is extremely difficult to hold public meetings. However, a series of lectures with the new outlines was begun in June in Almada. Only persons of good will interested in the work were Invited, and an average of 56 attended instead of the usual 30 to 35. Two very Joyful and well-attended meetings were held to celebrate the Memorial; one in Lisbon proper and one in Almada. The total attendance was 140, with 6 partaking of the emblems. The small Lisbon hall customarily holds only about 30, but 65 crowded into it and the adjoining passageway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Generally the Portuguese attend meetings quite regularly ; so sometimes the publishers fall to appreciate the importance of home Bible studies. This may account for the fact that an average of only 19 studies were held each month, although this Is well above the average of 10 the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of special significance to the Portuguese brethren was the release of two Portuguese publications at the New York convention. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> will now be available to them and this will, without a doubt, have a favorable effect upon the back-call and Bible-study work. Also, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organisation</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese will be a great boon to the brethren in improving the organization of the work. With these two wonderful helps the work in Portugal has bright prospects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally especially good interest Is located in the field. One back-call made upon an American born lawyer and his wife proved to be quite interesting. Although born a Catholic and not having any previous interest in the Bible, he took great interest in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> which had been obtained by his wife. When the back-call was made he had read more than half of the book and had made many notes and questions in the margin. The publisher who made the back-call was given a two-hour cross-examination, legal style!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On two occasions a young Interested couple from Gibraltar visited the brethren and were greatly encouraged by the companionship and instruction which they received. Although all alone as a witness, the wife is now doing a little publishing on her own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We look forward to future reports from Portugal as the tiny group of witnesses holds forth the truth to a nation steeped in the darkness of Catholicism and denied the freedom to get out from under its pall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God, in his command: “Preach the word,&quot; has been extremely patient and long-suffering with the Inhabitants of Sierra Leone. Tradition Is a “stone of stumbling” to these people, including some of the brethren. Regardless of a previous lull in gospel-preaching, honest-hearted publishers are seizing every opportunity to comply with the above command and excellent results have been accomplished, particularly during the past year. The pioneer letters from the Society have stimulated several to apply for this blessed feature of service. It is certain that many more are in position to enter these ranks too, and it is anticipated they will soon decide upon pioneering as a life career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magazine Day was started Saturday, August 5. That day 116 magazines were placed, being one less than all of those placed the previous month I Some were timid, fearing that the people would “look down upon them” if they were seen offering magazines on the streets. Some have overcome this fright now, and when the increase in number of magazines is effected it is expected the majority of the brethren will be engaging in this grand feature of service. One pioneer reported that some of his best studies have resulted from street witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public meetings, for long a weakness in the company’s activity, got off to a good start. Some fall to appreciate this provision from Jehovah and refuse to encourage its continuance. With diligent counsel on this point it is expected that this matter will soon be cleared, that the brethren here will be balanced in all company activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man, formerly a schoolteacher in one of the local orthodox religious schools with whom a pioneer faithfully conducts a study in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> was invited to the company meetings. His first meeting was the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtotver </span><span class="font4">study. He was amazed to see how the brethren responded so quickly to the questions. After the meeting he said, “This is truly a study group.” Next he attended the service meeting and remained for the theocratic ministry school. He was overjoyed as a result of the amount of information conveyed in so short a time. Particularly was the ministry school appealing because of the student talks. He expressed a desire to be able to deliver talks likewise in the future. Now he is having an active share in Kingdom ministry, preparing his assignments exceptionally well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is realized that much hard work lies ahead. The surface has just been scratched. A strenuous effort must be put forth continually to maintain or to surpass the 1951 quota. One’s vigil cannot be relaxed, as the accomplished end is nearer than most men believe.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Few countries have suffered more from the brutality of false religion than has Spain. To this day the country has not recovered from the economic turmoil brought about by the civil war when the present dictator, sponsored by the Catholic Hierarchy, overthrew the then-existing liberal form of government. Revealing her true attitude toward freedom, the Catholic Church rules with an iron hand and any indication that her subjects are daring to avail themselves of knowledge from the Bible is certain to bring forth her wrath. Her methods are simple. If threats and intimidation fail to accomplish her purpose she deprives the individual of his job regardless of the great misery and suffering that this may bring upon that person or his family. Or if this one who dares to preach the gospel is not a Spanish national he is promptly expelled from the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year word was received from a German brother and his wife who had fled from Germany and were endeavoring to eke out an existence at Santa Ana. He had learned the truth from portions of a booklet which he had found in a German concentration camp. Although without the companionship and encouragement which comes from association and study with others of like precious faith, this brother steadfastly continued to preach the Kingdom gospel. He found that many of the people well recognize that Catholicism leads the wrong way, but, even desiring the word of God, they still reject the truth. The pressure of opinion, fear and the difficult conditions rob them of the will to hold to that which is to their greatest welfare. In due time this brother was denounced by the Catholic priest and he was immediately compelled to leave the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although interested persons are difficult to find, the “sheep” are making themselves manifest. Recently a soldier went to visit some of the brethren who lived in a nearby town. The brethren gave him a witness concerning the Kingdom, to which the soldier listened attentively with an open heart. He was given literature to read. When he returned to the barracks he began to study the literature openly and a lieutenant caught him doing so. After examining the literature the lieutenant handed it back and told the soldier it would be harmful. Later a corporal, an official guard, a captain of the barracks and a judge all endeavored to interfere with this soldier’s reading of the literature. Later they took the literature he had placed in his suitcase and threatened him. The soldier was forced to go to the home of one of the brethren to continue his studies until he was transferred to another town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A new peak of 93 publishers was reached in June, and it is believed that even more are in the work who do not yet realize the importance of reporting. The Increase in average number of publishers over last year was 49.1 per cent.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not too many years ago when one spoke of the Americas he thought of a new world of freedom. He thought of a people who had gotten out from under totalitarian rulership, whether of kings or of dictators. He thought of a people who had fled from Europe to North or South America to try living in a free atmosphere. But now in these present days when men’s hearts are failing them for fear, we find a lack of freedom even in the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one goes behind the personality that rules the government, one often finds the powerful influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This religious system has always ruled with an iron hand whenever it could grasp power, and it has power now in Argentina. If you profess to be a Catholic, think as a Catholic and do as the Hierarchy tells you, then you can live in Argentina. But you won’t have freedom. A Christian finds life there difficult, but a Christian will not flee. In these days there is no place to flee. He prefers to stay and witness. The Christian receives great comfort from the words of Jesus as recorded at Matthew 5:11 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(NW),</span><span class="font5"> “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my sake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has seen to it that persecution has been brought against Jehovah’s witnesses, and they have lied about their activity. Jehovah’s witnesses are a peace-loving people. More than that, they are a God-loving people, and they want to promote true worship of Jehovah. Despite this, the government of Argentina has brought a ban upon Jehovah’s witnesses. It has forbidden Christian people to meet together to study the Lord’s Word. It has tried to kill the organization under which Jehovah’s witnesses operate. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy might see to it through its agents that the organization is broken up, but until they have sufficient power to kill every individual these will not stop the sounding forth of the good news of God’s kingdom. This good news will continually torment them because they are not for the kingdom of God; they are for the maintaining of this old, wicked world through its dictators and political regimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses take comfort in the words of Peter when he said, “If you are being reproached for the name of Christ, you are happy, because the spirit of glory, even the spirit of God, is resting upon you.” (1 Pet. 4:14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina are happy. They are rejoicing in the proclamation of the Kingdom. They are going into the homes of the people and studying the Bible with them. These with whom they study are learning the truth, and, in turn, are starting to preach. There has been a remarkable increase of 14 per cent in the number of ministers taking up the good news. During the year there was a new peak of 1,416 publishers proclaiming the gospel. The report from the branch servant in Argentina shows that these brethren are determined to go forward individually preaching the Word. To those who have an ear to hear they will say, “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.”—Rev. 19: 6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many are the “sheep” that are hungering for the truth, but few are the workers that are engaging in helping them find real spiritual nourishment. So, lacking in numbers, stress has been laid on increasing our own capacity for the work, bettering the quality of our work, and at the very start of the year provisions for this were made by the Society by having three publishers attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The field for trained missionaries is indeed enormous, and every hand is greatly appreciated. After graduating from the 15th class, they are again with us, ardently desiring to be active in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again blessings were poured out abundantly when, after nearly two years without receiving literature in quantity, permit was obtained for a big shipment whieh eame through. After such a long time without regular provisions, it did not take long for the hungry sheep to empty out the stockroom. This shortage of literature helped the brethren take more Interest if possible In good-will persons, and back-calls have increased pleasingly. However, this is not quite the case with home Bible studies, some publishers thinking they cannot conduct them. Yet this explains why the literature went so quickly. There were many persons who had heard the truth explained to them and read some publications but could not obtain additional copies of the books to give to those to whom they talked. Now their wish came true and they did not delay in using what came to their hands. A one-month campaign was arranged featuring </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People</span><span class="font4"> and 20,000 were shipped out that month, even though they were rationed, which took nearly all our stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year the international assembly to be held In New York kept throbbing in the minds and hearts of the brethren, and was it not a real joy to know that 15, quite a record for our country, would be present there? No sooner had they returned than they were loaded down with questions about the great feast. Reports had been eagerly read but now firsthand information was to be had, so ears were strained not to miss a word. When the releases were shown, the gratefulness and joy could be read In the faces of all present for the abundance of blessings the Lord was bestowing on his servants of the Spanish-language realm, this fact strengthened by the knowledge that the same joy was felt throughout the whole world over like provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the Lord’s servants are rejoicing in their share of the work at this time of the end, and looking forward for increased privileges of service, the adversary loses no time in moving his dupes in this priest-ridden country into position to deliver what he thinks is a deathblow. How chagrined he must have been after striking! His master move executed, withdrawing our legal solicitorship and closing all our meeting places and stopping our literature work, and meant to demoralize the workers, it boomeranged back on him! The friends consider it an honor to be the object of the dragon’s wrath, for this was to happen to those of the woman’s seed and their companions for ‘keeping God's commandments, and steadfastly holding to the testimony of Jesus’. (Rev. 12:17) Fear or discouragement? Never! On the evidence of the nearness of the day, the desire to help others of good will know the good news before the accomplished end comes has been manifest throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Persons of good will with whom Bible studies had been held expressed their desire to share in the work with the Bible. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">An </span><span class="font4">Invalid woman who for several years had </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font4">unable to move even her head and with whom a pioneer had studied for four years before she could understand the truth, due to her ailments, with tears in her eyes expressed her gratitude to the Lord for answering her prayers. Now at last she could move her hands and use the Bible and thus be able to show others what the Word of God says, no matter what bans may be imposed on such a work! That certainly is not a spirit of despondency. Because the Lord is with his people, ‘when these things begin to come to pass they look up and lift their heads’ and rejoice to be in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hands have not drooped, and those that have let their hands hang down are being helped to lift them into activity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">new </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> doubled theocratic ministry lessons through </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">iDespertad!</span><span class="font4"> and the hope of soon having the new books to study; what more could be desired? Positively, as in Jeremiah’s case, ‘there is in our hearts as it were a burning fire shut up in our bones, and we are weary with forbearing, and cannot contain.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Legal steps have been taken to have our right to worship recognized, and we are looking forward to using this opportunity of giving a further witness to them, and praising Jehovah’s name still more.—Mark 13: 9.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the good news to the people has been steadily moving forward since Jehovah God began to rule as King. Especially in the past 1950 service year people of good will have hearkened to the Word and have taken their stand. A new peak in number of publishers, of 5,163, was reached in the month of August, and the average number of publishers throughout the year was 4,502. This is the highest average Jehovah’s witnesses have ever attained in Australia. The branch located at Sydney looks after the work in Australia, the Fiji Islands, Singapore and the Malay States as well as in the Republic of Indonesia. Reports have been submitted by the branch servant, all of which are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new territory has been opened by the Australian office, and that is in North Borneo. There are two publishers working there now. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in the territory under the Australian branch, for there are millions upon millions of people living in the East Indies. Reaching them will be a task, but the Society hopes to send some missionaries into these fields as soon as it can be arranged. Christ Jesus’ admonition to his apostles, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,” meant this territory too, and all of the islands; and, by the Lord’s grace, Jehovah’s witnesses want to get in there. It will mean further expansion, and we look forward to the day when Theocracy’s increase will include all of this territory. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the 1950 service year has been the New York international convention. When it was first announced many here pondered, ‘Could we undertake such a tremendous trip? Could we possibly take off four months from our secular work? Where is the money going to come from?’ Over 200 brethren were able to meet these obstacles and attend that great feast! The brethren who remained at home rejoiced that so many could go, and worked harder than ever in the Lord's service, resulting in an all-time peak of 5,163 publishers in the last month of the service year while all these brethren were away. Soon these conventioners will be back home and then they will have the joy of sharing their experiences with their brethren as they gather at the six different district assemblies that will be held in the next few months in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that over 200 witnesses journeyed more than halfway round the world has caused many outsiders to Inquire Into our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit assemblies continue to be a great boon to all. Meeting attendances at the last series of circuit assemblies have in many Instances been greater than those of the previous district assemblies. These attendances show great scope for many more publishers and these assemblies seem to provide just the needed stimulus. A pioneer sister writes: “Six of our good-will attended the circuit assembly and all took part in field service for the first time. They have resolved to be regular publishers from now on.” A brother only 14 years old who attends a large school related this experience at one assembly: “I invited 9 of my teachers to attend the public lecture ‘Liberty to the Captives’ and seven of them came, two of whom were Catholics.” This brother has a magazine route with 22 out of the 36 teachers in that school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of back-call and Bible-study work has been kept to the fore during the year and has resulted in many joyful experiences. Reporting on this work one publisher writes: “After the sixth study with a group of four adults and three children they asked if they could have a talk the next week if they were to invite their neighbors in. Next week Instead of the usual 7 there we found 19 gathered in the small room. Two of the men had stayed home that day to invite the neighbors. When questioned about staying away from work their reply was: “This work is more Important; we’re not going to be so interested In our jobs from now on.” Since then 6 from this Bible study have engaged in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the brethren in Western Australia have spent much time working with the native colored people. One small company now reports that 38 of these people are publishers in their company, in spite of the fact that many of them are or have been illiterates. The few white folk have been taking our colored brethren into the work with them for training. As one of the sisters, accompanied by a colored sister, called at the door of a lady who was opposed she was scornfully asked: “What are you doing to help the colored people?” Quickly the colored sister spoke up for herself: “They have taught me to read and write so that I can learn the Bible myself and not only teach myself but answer many of the questions that white people ask me about the Bible.” “Well,” admitted the opposer, “you are certainly getting somewhere with these people, for I have had several of them call around with this literature and they are always clean and neat and none of our churches are able to get them that way.” This company expects to take 80 to 90 colored folk to the next district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past few years thousands of displaced European people have come to Australia and many of them show much Interest in the Kingdom message. Several miles distant from a town where a circuit assembly was being held was a large camp for these displaced folk. On the Sunday morning a few of the publishers called at this camp and in the course of witnessing invited those who could understand them to come to the public meeting being given that afternoon in the town. What a joy it was to have 60 of them come! Reports from some of the companies show that a number of these displaced persons have already become publishers and that their zeal and love of the Kingdom is an inspiration to the other friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we here In Australia view the past year we are reminded of David’s words: “The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.” (Ps. 16:6) The Increases that the Lord has given us are thrilling. Great is the joy of those engaging in the Lord’s service. The love and unity that continues to grow among the brethren is very pleasant and our fellowship in the Lord most strengthening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A healthy increase in theocratic service has taken place in Fiji during the past year. This has come despite setbacks and difficulties caused by the arbitrary actions of the authorities. First, the Society’s appeal against the government’s refusal to allow six Gilead graduates to enter the country was rejected. This was followed by refusal from the authorities for permission to import the Fijian version of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of AU the People.</span><span class="font4"> Upon advice from the Society we continued faithfully on, using the instruments that we already had, and this has resulted in a fine Increase in our ranks, not from the outside, but from within the colony itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By April our progress became very apparent when we reached a new all-time peak of 15 publishers, with six of our number being immersed. June saw an Increase to 19 publishers! Now our back-calls and Bible studies really began to increase. An average of 30 strangers have attended our last few public meetings. Many of them are now beginning to attend company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New York convention has thrilled us even though none from our ranks could attend. On June 10 thirty of our brethren from New Zealand and Australia stayed here in Suva for a few hours on their way to New York. This was the “most joyful occasion yet spent in Fiji”, says one of the local brothers. In those few hours we had a miniature convention, not even planned or prepared for, but which came through the love of these brethren and Jehovah’s spirit. Kingdom songs were sung, experiences related and helpful theocratic discussions held. Many of the overseas brethren were to attend the sixteenth class at Gilead, so they saw a little of what a foreign missionary assignment is like during their stay at Suva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the Kingdom message is mostly confined to the Suva area, yet it penetrates through to the other 80 or more inhabited islands. The following is an example of how such is taking place.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font4">During the first public meeting campaign held in 1947 a missionary brother contacted a lady of good will and she, her daughter and son and his wife attended the public meeting. Bible studies were conducted with them and soon they began to attend company meetings. Soon the missionary was conducting studies with another of this lady’s sons and his wife. This son advanced quickly and shortly asked for territory. Now he has three Bible studies with relatives and three more with other parties. But all these folks come from Rotuma island, which is 500 miles distant from Suva. Now the Kingdom message is being well extended to that faraway island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We of the Suva company of Jehovah’s witnesses take this opportunity of stating our whole-hearted support for the resolution against godless communism as adopted by nearly 85,000 persons at the New York Theocracy’s Increase Assembly. We are glad to do this because here in Fiji we are falsely classed as Communists by hypocritical religionists, not openly, it is true, but enough to blind most people to the pure Word of Almighty God as preached by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>NORTH BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In February of 1950, two company publishers began work In North Borneo. They were able to distribute some books and booklets and start a Bible study. A number of back-calls were made during the year on those who showed interest. In these seven months the two company publishers devoted 77 hours to the field service. At the Memorial season three other persons met with these publishers to celebrate the death of our Lord Jesus Christ Now that the good news has readied into North Borneo, we hope that it will continue to be preached there, all to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As is tiie case in all parts of the world where Kingdom service is carried on, the back-calls bring the greatest joy. The following experience goes to prove this fact. A brother and sister were making a back-call on a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot; </span><span class="font4">obtainer. Instead of finding this man at home they met his brother-in-law, an ardent Salvationist, but hungry for the truth. After a few back-calls he no longer attended church. This angered his wife and she wrote to the publishers requesting them not to call anymore. However, the call was made and the excited wife was so tactfully handled by the publisher that before many weeks had passed she too was sitting in on the studies. A few months have passed by and now the husband is to be immersed and possibly the wife too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently, a Dutch family secured </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’.</span><span class="font4"> The man accepted the truth and after a few weeks he began</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">having studies with his wife. An elder from the church called to find out why they were not attending church. The wife gave an excellent witness to this elder, who then asked: “Where have you learned all these things?” The reply was: “Jehovah’s witnesses call regularly upon us to show us Bible truths, and if you like you can come and attend them too.” The poor answer was: “I see, Jehovah’s witnesses, I have heard about them, they are juggling with Bible texts.” People of good will soon see who is teaching the truth, and now this man and his wife have become Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer brother in Manado (Celebes) is doing a good work there. He has placed much literature with the people and now there are several publishers active with him in field service. A brother and sister are doing excellent work on the isle of Billiton, In spite of opposition from the Catholic priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren In these Islands have had a happy year and now, by Jehovah’s grace, with Gilead students to arrive shortly, great expansion can be expected in this part of the field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus said to the unfaithful Jews, “Behold your house is left unto you desolate.” These words today apply to the religions of Christendom. A recent press report in Singapore states that one of the largest churches in the colony, owned by an American mission, is to be sold because the congregation has dwindled In recent months from 100 to 30 persons who are no longer able to keep It up. The reason why people are leaving these spiritual prisons becomes apparent when we recall that the two main issues during the year over which the various sects have wrangled and been sharply divided are: (1) whether or not the government should sponsor “Family Planning” clinics and (2) whether or not the government should approve state lotteries. The spiritual famine of Christendom is ravaging in Singapore!—Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But how have Jehovah’s witnesses been faring In this spiritual desert? The facts show that the company of Kingdom publishers here has been an oasis flourishing with spiritual blessings. Where the previous service year showed a monthly average of 20 publishers in Kingdom service, this year saw an average of 47 persons out monthly ‘preaching the word’. Six new peaks of publishers were reached during the year, with an all-time high of 69 reporting in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attendance at the Memorial celebration increased from 38 last year to 73 this year. Our second Immersion since the war was held in May, when 11 brethren symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are thankful to the Lord for the bountiful provision of spiritual food through the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">magazines. This life-giving knowledge will flow regularly to 704 new subscribers for these magazines. Following up these subscriptions is one of the means that the Lord is using for gathering his sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneering in this country of many languages has its problems, but that these are more than compensated for Is evident, as the following experience from a pioneer shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One of the first calls I made in this assignment of many languages and dialects was on a young lady of about 21 years. Her knowledge of English was poor and she was educated to read only Chinese. As no Chinese books were then available it did not seem possible to study with her even though she seemed genuinely interested In the Bible. However, several months later I came upon this girl again while engaged in public meeting activity in another part of the city. Her first words were, ‘You teach many people in my street. Could you please try and teach me?’ By this time the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> book In Chinese was to hand, so a study was commenced using this and the Chinese Bible. Questions were propounded in the simplest Englisb possible and it was most encouraging to watch the progress of this girl who had such a desire to learn. Many were the amusing incidents too when she could not think of the right words to express herself. In answer to ‘How were Noah and his family saved over the flood?’ she replied, ‘Velly hard to say. I think they make velly big sampan [boat].’ As to whether Christendom’s clergy teach the truth the answer was, ‘They bluff.' However, her knowledge of the truth increased week by week and it was not long before the opportunity came to Invite her out into the service. She very joyfully accepted and it surely was a pleasure to watch this young publisher enter into the work with such zeal when Chinese-speaking people were contacted. Truly language is no real barrier when a person has a desire to learn of Jehovah’s purposes.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The country of Austria is still a divided nation, because the governments of Russia, Britain, France and the United States control certain parts of the land. But even though this condition exists, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to increase and carry on the expansion work that was foretold to be accomplished in these last days. We observe from the annual report of the branch servant that there has been a 34 per cent increase in the number of publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom, a peak of 2,377 being reached. This report brought joy to the hearts of all the publishers in Austria because it was proof to them that there are “other sheep” in the country and that they are being found. The brethren there have the joy of feeding them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch office not only looks after the organization of the work in Austria with its five circuits and 143 companies and many pioneers, but it has also undertaken the responsibility of doing considerable printing. The branch office now publishes 76,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and 270,000 of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazine each year in addition to 50,000 booklets and hundreds of thousands of handbills and other printed matter. In spite of the difficult handicaps and the growing indifference of the people toward life in general, it is certainly good to see Theocracy’s increase in Austria. The branch servant sets out a few of the high lights of the year, telling us some of their joys and difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has been a steady encouragement and is very much appreciated by all as the food from the Lord’s table. It gives us a vision of the expansion of true worship, and is an impulse to push on with the work. Many new brethren have joined the old ranks, as 523 not only symbolized their consecration by water immersion, but started the work straightway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although we have not reached our goal of pioneers, as not yet 10 per cent of the publishers have become full-time workers, we are glad that we had 82 pioneers in the field last month. Some vacation pioneers have asked for application forms in order to let the general pioneer work now take the first place in their life. As there are still many places in Austria where the good news has never been preached before, or at least not during the past fifteen years, there is still much room for more pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We placed 206,464 books and booklets. That is not so many as last year, but we placed 333,745 magazines, and that is three times as many as last year. This is due mainly to the fact that you, dear Brother Knorr, gave permission to have the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine printed here in Austria just at tlie beginning of this service year, in September 1949. Since then, between 11,000 to 12,000 copies of every issue have been distributed. The street-witnessing work got a new impetus from this, and a number of little companies have introduced it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since May, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has also been printed locally. We bought a small addressing machine and all the magazines are now being shipped from this office. This, and also the other increasing work has certainly kept the little Bethel family busy, and we all are glad to do our best, as long as the Lord keeps the doors open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a joy to see the progress some of the companies are making through the theocratic school. There is a good and steadily increasing number of brothers who are well able to deliver a public talk. Thus we were able to hold nearly 2,000 public lectures during last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Compared with former years, we can say that, on the whole, we do not have so many difficulties in spreading the truth in Austria at present. Before, arrests used to take place, books and booklets were confiscated, and the brethren persecuted as peddlers, or colporteurs without a license. Now, however, we are recognized as one of the religious minorities, which have the same rights as the state churches. The reason for this is mainly the stand our brethren had taken during the Nazi occupation. Many men who are now in responsible positions were with our brethren in concentration camps, and others have heard of their courageous and real Christian stand. The authorities are now more tolerant and more democratic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are a few cases where our brethren who are not yet 18 years of age are having difficulties. The authorities take as excuse the press law, which says that people under 18 years are not allowed to distribute literature. Of course, it is wrong to apply this law against our young brethren, as they are not engaged in any commercial business, but exercise their faith. Preaching the gospel is their God-given right above all, but they have also the law about religious freedom on their side. And that says plainly that no other law or regulation may be in opposition to the law that guarantees everybody freedom to exercise his faith as long as this is not against moral and proper conduct. In every case we gave a thorough explanation to the authorities, and the young publishers were not molested thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our circuit assemblies are always a great encouragement and blessing for the brethren and people of good will. Many of the new ones have been so encouraged and filled with joy that they gladly joined the brethren In the field, and thus had their first grand experience as a publisher of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The political agitation over the royalty question, Shall the king return? has had the people of Belgium in quite a turmoil during the past year. When the Catholic party finally succeeded in having the king return, a wave of strikes and other manifestations of protest swept the country, and a civil war was averted only when the king transferred his constitutional powers to his son Baudouin. Amidst all of this dispute in Belgium there is a small group of witnesses proclaiming the King of kings and Lord of lords, the Rightful Ruler of the world. They have clearly in mind that Christ Jesus had taken to himself his power and begun to reign in 1914. He is Jehovah’s appointed King! It was time to announce to the people that Jehovah our God, the Almighty, would reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus told his disciples that this gospel must be preached in the last days, he meant now; and the publishers in Belgium are directing the people to the King of the new world. It is very encouraging to all to see a 33 per cent increase in the number of publishers engaging in the field service. Now they have reached a new peak of 2,462 serving the King. Many things have happened in Belgium during the year, and the branch servant gives us an interesting report of a few of the outstanding events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we made magazine bags at the branch to equip the ministers for more effective street work. The intensified work on the streets has been the means of giving a good witness to the Belgian public. The joy and enthusiasm that Jehovah’s witnesses manifest while presenting the magazines on the street has revealed to the people that they have a real hope. The following experience had in the street work comes from one of our circuit servants who has been serving in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium. He writes: “I was working with the magazines on the street in a French-speaking territory. I know very little French but my knowledge was sufficient to show a man the way to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s organization by the help of the Lord. While I was calling out </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘La Tour de Garde'</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘R&amp;veilles-Vous!’</span><span class="font4"> a French-speaking man came to me and said that he would like a magazine, but, since he spoke French, I called my companion and he talked with him, resulting in his taking </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> from me. I said to my companion, ‘Ask to call back,’ and he did. After three or four days we called back and had a nice back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But I was only a short time in that company’s territory, so I traveled on and while I was advertising a public lecture on the street of another town a man tapped me on the shoulder, and I looked at him and recognized him as the French-speaking man with whom I had placed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> and made the back-call. He said in broken Dutch, ‘My wife study, my mother study, and I study, and the images broken and thrown away.’ Well, that was enough to understand that he and his family liked the truth. When we had our circuit assembly, he and his wife and mother were all baptized. So we see why the Lord through his organization caused the street work to be organized on the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a very nice increase in the number of public meetings held during the year. There were 1,069 public talks given in halls, private homes, cafes, parks and public places, making a 57 per cent increase over last year’s total of 683 public meetings. Public meeting activity has been followed up by back-call and Bible-study work, and thus the people of good will have been properly cared for. It is also good to note that we had a 36 per cent Increase in Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we continued to enjoy much freedom to carry on our Bible-education work in Belgium. There have been some instances where misguided persons have tried to cause us trouble. In January during one of our circuit assemblies a brother was apprehended by the police while in the magazine work and accused of peddling without a permit and legal action was instituted against him. The king’s attorney told the brother that if he could furnish him with a letter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showing that our work is not considered as peddling, then he would be acquitted. Our lawyer took the matter up with the Ministry and he received a letter saying that the administration had decided that our type of activity would not be considered as peddling. The brother filed a copy of the letter with the king’s attorney and he has heard no more of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 4th of July a sister was apprehended by the police while in the witness work in a small village. She wrote a letter to the king’s attorney explaining the work, and the branch office also wrote sending a copy of the letter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and no more has been heard of that case. In a small town in the Flanders the local police thought they would ban Jehovah’s witnesses and they took it upon themselves to confiscate a pioneer’s literature. Efforts were made by the company servant and other brethren of a nearby company to get the literature back, but to no avail. The branch office advised the nearby company to organize a public meeting in the town and work it with a group. When the brethren thus called their bluff the police did nothing and later the pioneer’s literature was returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That which has worked the greatest hardship on our Christian educational work was caused by a circular letter coming from the minister of justice dated June 6,1950, which included the Watch Tower publications with the artistic and literary works which are prohibited to be transported by the Belgian railway and postal systems. We were not informed of this unjust action, but a friend sent us a copy of the circular. We addressed a written protest to the minister of justice, and many other Belgian citizens also sent letters of protest, but until now they have all been Ignored. It Is certainly ridiculous to ban our publications from being transported when they are otherwise permitted to freely circulate in the country. We are doing all we can to get this matter before the proper authorities so that this wrong may be rectified. It is impossible for Christians to understand why Bible publications should be hindered in any way from freely circulating, especially now that atheism is increasing everywhere and godless communism is threatening to sweep across Europe. It is hoped that honest men in the government will correct this wrong before more harm is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Numerous articles have been published in the Beligian newspapers and magazines accusing Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Society of being connected with a fanatical native movement in the Belgian Congo called the “Kltawala”. In Belgium the law requires that when someone answers an article published by a newspaper or magazine the newspaper or magazine must publish the answer. We have taken advantage of this right to defend the Kingdom work against these slanderous articles, and our answers have been published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since January 21, 1949, the work of the W’atch Tower Society has been banned In the Belgian Congo and the true witnesses of Jehovah have had to suffer because of these false reports. Written protests have been made to the minister of colonies and ample proof submitted that Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Society are not connected with the subversive “Kitawala”, but these protests have gone unanswered. The case is now being taken to the Counsel of State here in Brussels which has the authority to decide as to the constitutionality of the law banning the Watch Tower Society in the Congo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Story</span><span class="font4"> booklet which tells the facts about the situation in the Congo has been printed In French and widely distributed among influential persons here in Belgium, and this has afforded us the opportunity of giving a greater witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name. There are many honest persons living here In Belgium and in the Congo who know that Jehovah’s witnesses have nothing to do with the fanatical “Kltawala” and who have taken our defense. For example, one afternoon a lady called at the office to obtain several copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Story.</span><span class="font4"> She wanted to send them to her brother who is a governor in the Belgian Congo. It seems that her brother wanted them to present to the native chiefs so that they could see the difference between the “Kitawala” and the “Watch Tower”. The lady said that she was an ardent Catholic but that she knew we had nothing to do with the rebellious natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All together there are now 11 brethren from Gilead working in Belgium. They appreciate very much their privilege of working in this country with their Belgian brethren and their desire is to keep on improving their ministry so that they can do more to help their brethren and the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The past service year has been packed with many joys and blessings for Jehovah’s servants in Belgium. We look forward with joyful anticipation to the work ahead of us for this year. In Belgium we have a population of 8,602,614 persons, many of whom have not yet received a witness concerning the Kingdom. There are 1,880 towns and villages which are not assigned to companies or pioneers. What prospects there are for more expansion! What may we expect when all these towns and villages have been properly worked? Just what we can expect is shown by the report of one company during the last service year. Last August 1949 this company started off with 35 publishers and in May 1950 it attained a new peak of 102 publishers. These 102 publishers work in a territory of about 42,000 inhabitants, so we can see what is possible here in Belgium when the territory is Intensively worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the wonderful privilege of some of us to attend the International convention in New York this year and we were able to appreciate as never before how Jehovah is leading his people by his organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The 1950 service year has been one of the most prosperous for Jehovah’s servants in Luxembourg. They have had a 49 per cent increase in average number of publishers in the field during the past year. It is difficult for a new publisher to work in this country because it means he will almost certainly be ostracized by his fellow Luxembourgers. They consider anyone who leaves the Catholic church as a most sinful and wicked person. To become one of Jehovah’s witnesses is just about the worst thing anyone could do. This is the general attitude throughout the land and therefore is an obstacle for new publishers to overcome. Here again we see that persistency in pushing forward with Theocracy’s increase brings results. Luxembourg comes under the direction of the Belgian branch office, and following is their report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following experience sent in by a Gilead graduate shows that many persons who ridicule Jehovah’s witnesses do so because they have been misinformed. “One of the brethren who works in a factory was continually being picked on and ridiculed by his fellow workers who, of course, knew that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They talked with contempt about the Bible. Usually he answered them short and to the point. One of the better-educated workers observed all this and decided that the brother was a little queer because he never seemed to say much in defense of himself. So he thought he would make fun at him too. So he went over to him and said he would like to talk to him about his Bible. The brother answered that he would be glad to do so, but not there, because they were on the employer’s time. Then the man invited the brother to his home. The publisher, of course, said that he would be glad to come and also that he would bring along three Bibles to help in the discussion and to prove that what he believes is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The day he made the call he first let the man talk a while, and he specialized in theosophy. He showed his contempt for organized religion. After finding out what the man believed the brother then told him that he would show him from the Bible exactly what the truth is. He then witnessed for two hours without stopping. When he had finished the man said, ‘I told you to come here so that I could belittle you, and now you have turned the tables and done It to me. You have proved to me that orthodox religious teachings are lies and what the Bible truth is.’ The man explained to his wife and they expressed the desire to learn more, so a Bible study was arranged at once. The man started to attend all company meetings and, needless to say, he is now a company publisher preaching to his friends and relatives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report from the missionary continues: “The priests here play a prominent role In turning hearing ears from the truth. On numerous occasions friendly persons have told us how the priests have warned them to have nothing to do with us, to burn our books or to bring them to the priests. The people are warned that the police are after us, and that if they don’t turn over to the priests all our books then the police will be after them. Even the children are intimidated. When one local priest found that no one turned in any books after his warning, he talked to the children and told them to take the books from their homes and bring them to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three brothers from Gilead have been working in the city of Luxembourg during the last year and they have been able to help the brethren much in regard to better organizing the work. The language is quite a problem for them because French is the official language of the country, while the majority of the people read German and among themselves they speak the local dialect. But in spite of all these obstacles for both the local brethren and the missionaries they are receiving many rich blessings from Jehovah and they may be assured of many more during the year to come.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country, high in the Andes mountains, is a country racked by many revolts. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, continue to preach in good season and in unfavorable season. A number of new missionaries have been added to those already working in the cities of Bolivia. As the year passed, more and more company publishers associated themselves with the theocratic organization to share in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. There was a 30 per cent increase in number of publishers as compared with the previous year. It is hoped that the Society will be able to open up new fields in Bolivia during 1951, and that the present group of 59 publishers now in the land will press on diligently in preaching the Word. Despite revolutions, climatic conditions, steep hills to climb and rugged terrain, the good news of God’s kingdom is making progress. The branch servant’s report portrays the attitude of the people in that land toward Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year began with a general revolution or civil war all over the country in September, but, happily, such lasted only about two short weeks. The country was mobilized and the rebellion was snuffed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our first circuit assembly was held in Oruro in November, to which friends came from Cochabamba by train and from La Paz by train and truck. Some who attended were very new in the truth and expressed delight over the truths presented that were new to them and at how happily and zealously the little gathering of Christians unitedly preached the gospel in Oruro during the three days of the assembly. They went home with a determination to do more about Jehovah’s service and have been regular publishers since. Two public meetings were held, one Saturday at 6 p. m. and another on Sunday afternoon, both in the university’s auditorium. The attendance at the first one was 105, which is a peak attendance for Oruro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Quite a number of the Bolivian brethren would go out in the service only when some of the missionaries accompanied them, and this they had been accustomed to doing for a number of months. The fact that eight of the missionaries would go to the states for a few months for their vacation and to attend the convention was called to their attention. Would that mean that the native brethren accustomed thus to go out would become completely Inactive during the absence of the missionaries? They were exhorted to continue to preach the gospel during that time, each individual shouldering his own burden. And we are glad to say that the majority of these brethren did just that by taking over some of the studies and back-calls left behind by the missionaries, as well as going out in the house-to-house work and distributing subscriber’s magazines as is customarily done by the Gilead graduates here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because the railroad companies in Bolivia allow a generous amount of free baggage on the train, the passengers customarily haul their beds too along with their bags. It is interesting to see the Gilead missionaries come to an assembly from other towns each having his bed, that Is, mattress and bedding rolled up In a soilproof cover, along with his suitcases, all prepared to stay for a few days at the missionary home of the assembly city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work is progressing fairly well in Santa Cruz, where the fourth missionary home has recently been set up. The Gilead graduates, three Canadians, who are there are still having to contend with their problems of mastering the language and getting adjusted to the climate. They encountered opposition from the Protestant clergy and there were a few discussions with the clergy in the homes of the people wherein the preachers became very upset. Now they are avoiding the Gilead missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convention in the States gave a tremendous witness to the world and the generally favorable press comments published in the States about the assembly also found their way into the Bolivian newspapers. Just recently </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La Razon </span><span class="font4">of La Paz published quite a favorable article and accurate description of the convention. After describing the appearance of thousands of witnesses on the streets with magazines and the yeartext signs posted in the stadium, the writer commented on the seemingly small concern of the Witnesses over the distressing world events, such as the Korean War which was filling the newspaper headlines, saying that their concern was heavenward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now after the return to Bolivia of all of the graduates who visited the convention, we will have 19 of these foreign missionaries working here, and with these we look forward to a greater expansion work in this land. We would be very glad to have more missionaries to help us in La Paz and Oruro, and also the inland cities of Potosi and Tarija, which have not been worked yet. We are confident that by Jehovah’s grace the incoming service year will be one of greater opportunities and blessings in his service than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Excellent progress is being made in Brazil despite opposition on the part of the government against the work. A decree was issued by the president of Brazil that the work of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society should cease for six months. But there are no good reasons why Christians should not continue to preach the gospel. Jehovah’s witnesses are certainly not against the state. They are not interested in politics; they are not engaged in any commercial enterprise. The only thing they were doing in Brazil was preaching true worship, which was contrary to the wishes of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Catholic Church holds great power in Brazil and wants to keep the people of that country in the ignorance and subjection in which it has bound millions of people in South America, Italy and Spain. While they claim to be the preservers of the Bible in this enlightened age, still they do not want the people to feast their eyes on that good Book. That is why the Catholic Hierarchy and its religious leaders are so opposed to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all the opposition that has been raised up during the past year, we find a splendid 61 per cent increase in Brazil in the number of publishers proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, and a new peak was reached of 3,873 ministers of the good news. In Brazil the Word of God is being preached, and, by Jehovah’s grace, the witnesses there will continue to press on through 1951 with even greater zeal than ever before. The branch servant’s report giving some of the high lights of the past service year is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Constantly measures are Introduced to curb the activities of foreign anarchists. Taking full advantage of fears and confusing conditions the clergy have made it a point to misrepresent the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, principally that of advertising public lectures with handbills and placards. They label it as foreign propaganda destined to undermine the Brazilian way of life. A few arrests have been made, during assemblies throughout the year, but after considerable questioning the brethren have been promptly released. These arrests are, in almost all instances, effected by radio patrol cars answering protests lodged by local priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dire concern over immigration of foreign undesirables has caused us considerable anxiety over incoming missionaries, graduates from the school of Gilead. Seven such missionaries of the 13th class have had their permanent residence visas withheld from them now for nearly nine months. The dispute over their acceptability in Brazil is purely one maintained alive by the clerical element in the affair. This element is always consulted, and especially so with matters pertaining to the Internal and External Affairs department of the Ministry of Justice, which has the final say in the matter. The clash they have with the Society is, then, clearly one of religious prejudice, the fruit of exclusive arbitrariness, A director in the department made it very plain when he said, “This is a Catholic country, your organization is demoralizing to Brazilian customs and ways of life, which are exclusively Catholic; therefore these young ladies (referring to the seven Gilead sisters) as well as their teachings are definitely out of place here, I shall have to await the decision of the federal court on the legality of your organization. If it is decided favorably for you, then I will let the missionaries remain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to this hostile attitude on the part of the clergy no Society of Jehovah’s witnesses has ever been recognized by the Brazilian government as a legitimate organization with full rights to carry on the activities of preaching the Word throughout Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Down through the years until 1947 the Society continued the fight to establish itself on a legal footing in various manners. Every effort was blocked. Finally, in 1947, under the newly formed constitution of 1946, the Society quietly took its proper place as a registered Brazilian corporation known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Socicdade Torre de Vigia de Biblias e Tratados.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Catholic Action stepped in and acted. A lady director let go against the Society. She insinuated, “But, according to the information of the police of Sao Paulo and of this capital, ‘there must exist,’ really, ‘other aims’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">still somewhat obscure and not declared.</span><span class="font4"> Its unhampered operation, then, could come to constitute, in the future, a problem of difficult and troublesome solution, in view of its hiding its true designs. ...” She induced the president of the republic and the minister of justice to decree Its suspension as “being dangerous to the public welfare and to the safety of the State and of the collectivity, to the public and social order, to morals and to good manners”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just two months after the pope hung a medal around the minister of justice’s neck in Rome, he hung a millstone about ours in Brazil. He suspended the Society for six months. But the preaching still goes on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the hardships of preaching the Word that backward Brazil presents, both in injustice meted out by its leaders and the physical hardships encountered in taking the message to out-of-the-way places, the publishers continue to be added to daily. The Brazilian ministers realize that there is much work to be done yet to reach the more than 50 million people scattered throughout a country larger than the continental United States. They show much zeal and perseverance in preaching. Despite hardships, inconveniences and practically no comforts or communications to speak of, a circuit servant regularly penetrates the wild profuse jungle country of the north, visiting small companies and isolated persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enthusiasm ran high in the month of July as the 1950 international convention in New York city drew near. Three different groups, 31 brethren In all, went by plane. All of them made considerable sacrifice in paying for such a long journey. We in Brazil rejoiced in the privilege of attending the convention In New York city and associating with the rest of Jehovah’s visible organization now when he causes such a mighty work to be accomplished before our eyes throughout the entire world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">With a population of 400,000 inhabitants composed of people of six races, British Guiana offers good territory for preaching the gospel. It is a truly cosmopolitan country, as the largest group are East Indians, then follow the Negroes, aborigines, Portuguese, Chinese and the white people. All live side by side; so while the witnesses go from door to door they are constantly meeting different kinds of people from all nations, kindreds and tongues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Guiana” means “land of many waters”, and this is literally true. Often the publishers take off their shoes to wade through the back yards when visiting people of good will. But then, many of the publishers have never been encumbered with shoes. The heaviest rainfall of the last 75 years fell in 1950, but even this did not bog the brethren down in preaching the good news. The experiences of the brethren have been very interesting, and the branch servant gives us a good report of what is being accomplished in this small South American territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in March when the colony’s only radio station agreed to allow us free time once each week on the “morning devotion” daily program of 15 minutes. Now’ at last the truth could penetrate into the interior with regularity! Copies are given to both the radio station and the government of all broadcasts; so an excellent testimony to our stand will thus go into their records. Came the time for our first broadcast, and who should be at the studio but the usual Anglican minister and, indignant at having to give way to Jehovah’s witnesses, this again happened the second week. However, the radio station boldly allowed our programs—but every other Saturday instead of weekly; this, they said, “because other denominations hearing us wanted the same privilege.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New York convention was the talk of every publisher even if thousands of miles away, and a great send-off was given to 12 delegates from here. More would have gone but the sudden devaluation of the pound sterling put them at a financial disadvantage which caused them to change their plans. With the fast air-mail service from New York we were able to schedule three assemblies in Georgetown as we received regular convention reports and for which we were very grateful. And not only the reports, but kind individuals sent us copies of all new releases by air. So you can imagine the unexpected thrill to the brethren as, one after another, out of the bag came new things, and who had anticipated so much, so soon and so timely? Now we are looking forward to the return of our delegates and new missionaries aud then for a 4-day district assembly in the warm and dry November weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon new Instructions from the president the companies in British Guiana will now be served three times a year by the circuit servant who is also the branch servant. Means of transportation is oftentimes by boat, and time so spent always proves to be ‘in season preaching’ because fellow passengers readily take the magazines. Most of them recognize </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and as we ply between the many little Islands en route to small companies and isolated brethren one can spend almost the entire journey in witnessing. The visit is enthusiastically awaited by the brethren who have done much oral advertising in advance. The result is that upon arrival the white circuit servant is already well known and is greeted by all the villagers with “Good day, breeder!” All the “hard” questions are saved for his visit, and so there is quite a session when these are answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The wild interior too is receiving a witness. In addition to one pioneer brother who has been sowing some good seed there, as well as doing some patient watering, there is a constant stream of men heading for the gold and diamond fields, including some who love the Kingdom. While In Georgetown some of these men learn of the truth sufficiently well to begin preaching themselves. So as they return to the fields they take along literature to distribute, thus spreading true riches. We now find subscribers all over the interior, and who can tell to what this will yet lead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another milestone was made in 1950 with our first Chinese witness in the field and symbolizing his consecration. Some time ago he had shown good will by donating his time in building a sound machine for use in our weekly open-air talks. Following this he was offered a Bible study and is now making good progress in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regular free write-ups are given us in the press wherein our current activities at home and abroad are highlighted. Thus in numerous ways people come to learn of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and a large proportion are glad to discuss the Bible with us and it becomes a problem as to with whom we can most </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">profitably</span><span class="font4"> spend the limited time available each week. The time is ripe for more publishers than ever to start in the field ‘preaching the Word’, and as our year closes we thank Jehovah for these blessings and for a further all-time peak of 244 publishers for August, making a 10 per cent increase for the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Theocracy’s Increase Assembly was the climax of the year for the brethren in British Honduras just as it was for the publishers the world over. Jehovah’s witnesses in British Honduras eagerly awaited the return of some of their delegates from New York and were very happy to hear of the convention, the Bethel home, the new factory and of the work that is being done in the United States toward the worldwide advancement of the Kingdom message. British Honduras has had its share in Theocracy’s increase with an 18 per cent jump in publishers over last year, having reached a new peak of 82 Kingdom pro-claimers. World conditions have hit this country a hard blow, as the devaluation of the pound in the sterling area affected the work of the people considerably. But this only makes it more urgent that the preaching of the good news go forward in that land. The report from the branch office relates a few interesting happenings and experiences that occurred in the country during 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other high lights of our service year were the visits of Brother Morgan and you, Brother Knorr. Brother Morgan’s talks to the brethren and the public were received with much approval. Your talk, “Preach the Word,” was also accepted whole-heartedly, and many favorable comments were made on It. This talk and the visits from you American brethren did a lot toward making up the minds of some to attend meetings and also take part in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another factor that Is playing a part in the Theocracy’s increase in British Honduras Is the public meeting activity. Here in Belize we have been able to hold a number of public meetings on the Battlefield, that is, the public square in front of the courthouse. Our attendance at these outdoor meetings has been gratifying. Tuesday night has been selected for these meetings. Following the public talk the people are invited to attend the company book study at the Kingdom Hall, which is not far from the Battlefield. This seems to be effective, as our attendance has increased at the hall. Our sound equipment is very effective also, as many people are commenting that they can hear it in their homes nearby. The public meetings have been a means to get newly Interested ones started in the service. Many of our new publishers In recent months have started preaching, due to the public meetings. They get started by taking handbills and distributing them each week. Our indoor meetings, for the most part, have been held in our Kingdom Hall just prior to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study on Sundays. This too has been effective, in that many people that would not come to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study stay and enjoy it; which results in a gratifying attendance increase. However, it appears that our Kingdom Hall will soon be too small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we go about our Father’s business we have many experiences. Here is an interesting experience of one of the missionaries. She states: A Catholic priest called on one of my studies one day. He told her she was living In sin and the things she ought to be doing so she would be living right. Then he began telling her how he had studied for fifteen years to become a priest and had learned Greek, Hebrew and Latin. This woman was not afraid of him, as she has been reading the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine for some time. Also we had just recently studied the chapter on “Hell” in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> which chapter contains several Hebrew and Greek words. So she asked him to explain “sheol” and “hell”. He gave her an explanation but It wasn’t the same as she had learned. So she told she was studying the Bible and she knew that “sheol” and “hell” mean the same thing, that is, the grave, and there is no torture there. The priest wanted to know who was instructing her in the Bible. She said, “A Jehovah’s witness lady.” He said, “What book are you using?” She showed him </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> He said, “That book is our greatest enemy.” But this woman does not consider It her enemy, for she Is still studying it, and gaining a needed knowledge for life in the new world, under the theocratic government</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is always good to observe in retrospect the wonderful progress of the past year, both in understanding of Jehovah’s purposes and in the activity of God’s servants in his Kingdom work. The brethren in Britain can rejoice in their share of the world-wide witness. It was one of their best years of progress as to Theocracy’s increase. They had an average of 3,600 more publishers than a year ago, with a peak of 22,678 ministers preaching the Word. This was an increase of 21 per cent. The fine growth in the organization can be attributed to the splendid work of the Kingdom publishers in Britain who have been sowing the seed and then watering and cultivating it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the great political unrest and the dissension between the two major political parties in Britain, many of the people have come to realize the hopelessness of all human experiments, and they know they will have to face future failures just as they have in times past. Therefore, many are turning to the Lord’s Word, there to find comfort and an understanding of the reason for the existence of the distressing conditions of today. How good the Lord is to give us more time to preach to these people and help them learn the way of life! The branch servant in Britain gives us a very interesting report of what has been done in Britain and how the brethren feel about their privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meetings held throughout the year have increased by nearly 4,000, with a total of over 26,000 meetings held. These public talks, together with the accompanying advertising by means of the handbills, have done much to keep the Kingdom message before the public eye. Time and again we hear of newly interested ones who have had their first interest aroused by their attendance at one of these public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit assemblies have contributed much to the general Increase in the field and also to keeping the minds of the publishers alert to their privileges. The attendance at the circuit assemblies has increased by 15,815, to a grand total of 52,648 in the year. It has now become a regular feature to see favorable press reports of these assemblies. One recently said: “They [Jehovah’s witnesses] have a reputation for overwhelming fervor in preaching their religion and we in this town will have an opportunity rarely presented In these days of marked religious apathy, of observing something of the fanatical zeal of these revivalists.” The religious clergy have become much embittered and they in turn have poured out a stream of lies in an effort to counteract the growing interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The campaigns with the magazines have brought splendid results. The new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> during the spring campaign yielded 43,000, while the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">campaign gave us over 22,000 new subscriptions. The circulation desk has handled over 100,000 new and renewal subscriptions in the year and we have actually had a 42 per cent increase in number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. All this has helped to open up the field to a greater witness, resulting in many back-calls and Bible studies. With the new style and brighter appearance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> we believe that the way will open up for more effective work with the magazines In the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the continued restrictive measures applied against our work in the colonies, it was deemed necessary to approach the Colonial Office here in London. After much effort to get a hearing and with no practical results, It was decided that a campaign be organized throughout the country to obtain the support of the members of Parliament. This proved very interesting, for we found that many were sympathetic. The brethren throughout the British Isles visited the member of Parliament in their own locality and presented the facts to them. One member raised a question in the House of Commons as to why Jehovah’s witnesses were not being permitted to enter certain of the colonies. The answer was very unsatisfactory; so this was followed by a further question as follows: “Can the secretary of state quote any Incidents in the last ten years which can be attributed to this Society, and, if so, is he quite certain that they have not been made the scapegoat by some political, religious or other body for such incidents?” The answer to these questions from the minister simply shifts the responsibility onto the local Colonial governments with the claim that they are in the best position to judge the situation. In the course of our witness to the ruling elements, it has been made plain that religious interests have had much to do with the restrictions that have been applied. The co-operation of the brethren throughout the land in contacting the members and leaving with them the two books that have been subject to a ban in one of the colonies, namely, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font4"> has done much to clarify the position we hold as servants of Jehovah. We look to him to direct the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event of the year was, of course, the great international convention in New York. So many of us looked forward to it throughout the year and it certainly proved to be all that we anticipated. In the early days we thought that there might be 500 that would make the trip from Britain, but as time went by the numbers Increased until they reached 850. There were so many difficulties of travel to overcome that it seemed impossible at one time that the brethren would be able to get there. Air Lines canceled their bookings at the last minute, and then, in the end all worked out in a marvelous way and with the obstacles removed. All were able to get there and enjoy the feast the Lord provided. Many have been the expressions of gratitude to the Lord for the blessings received. The British brethren have certainly been enthused by all that they saw and heard. The many releases of new literature have given much joy; particularly are we thankful for the gift of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</span><span class="font4"> It is so fitting that we should have this as the Lord is turning to his people a purified speech to help us in our Kingdom service. The privilege of seeing the new Bethel home and factory all so well equipped for the advancement of the Kingdom interests has given the brethren much pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The expansion in the field has called for more work at the branch and it is a joy to be able to say that all here count it a privilege to serve their brethren and to spend their time and effort in providing the necessary equipment to advance the field service. Service rendered to the Lord unstintingly brings its own reward, but once in a while we have the joy of reading a message from someone in the field who has been enlightened with the truth and out of a grateful heart gives expression to his feelings. One such has just come to hand and it reads: “Might I seek the privilege, even though well past threescore years and ten, in making a donation to further such a great explanatory work of God’s Word, the Bible. Blessed be the Creator who sent one of his humble messengers to my door. (Rev. 3: 20) I have learned more deep and everlasting truths of his invaluable Word and purpose in three months than I ever knew In my whole course of a lengthy life. God’s protection ever be on the Watch Tow’er Society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British field will push ahead with determination in the year that opens before us. No doubt it will be an eventful year and the Lord will have much in reservation for us; so we step out with our faith strong and with the resolve to intensify our efforts, knowing that so many of the Lord’s sheep are waiting to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and be comforted with the life-giving message of truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Only those who have carried forward the witness work in Eire can appreciate how bedarkened the people are. The Catholic Church will not let the light of God shine, nor will they allow the people of this land to read Jehovah’s Word. Centuries of Catholic domination have left a deep imprint on the country of Eire. It is truly priest-ridden. However, we can rejoice that the opportunity has been given the people of Eire to hear the truth, and that we have zealous company publishers and pioneers who press on in preaching the gospel. The people of Eire are warmhearted and easy to approach. If they were free from religious domination, they would be glad to hear the message of the Kingdom and would embrace it; but, because of the tremendous pressure brought to bear on the people of that land by the clergy, they are held in fear and have been incited to engage in mob action against those who are preaching the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it is God’s will that a greater witness be given in this land, it will be done. If there are more “sheep” to be gathered in Eire, they will be gathered; for Jesus said, “Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold,” and these he must also gather. The Lord’s word will never return to him void. Even though it is done through great difficulty and hardship, the message will go on. The work in Eire is under the direction of the branch office at London, and the servant there sent us a good report of the fight for truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, the Kingdom work has been pushed forward in face of much opposition. There have been attacks made on the pioneers as they have moved about on the streets, and concerted efforts made by the clergy and their allies In some of the towns to have the pioneers evicted. In one town the vigilantes have followed the publishers from door to door and done everything Imaginable to hound them out of town. True to Catholic policy, subtle schemes have been set afoot to intimidate the Kingdom publishers, and only by the Lord’s spirit has it been possible to work and maintain a foothold in these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two missionary homes operating in Dublin and Cork have done splendid work and the missionaries in these homes have by steady hard work succeeded in building up home Bible studies which are now bearing fruit. The progress is slow, but nonetheless definite. So often it is found that the Catholic person called upon has never before handled a Bible and knows nothing about its contents, due to the constant reiteration that the priests alone have the right to use and interpret it. Little by little the truth is gaining ground and those enlightened by the good news of the Kingdom are ready to show their appreciation, but when persecution begins it is only those who have the courage to stand firm against all relatives and friends that, by the Lord’s grace, continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Dublin there is comparative freedom and the company has grown to a peak of 50 publishers. All features of Kingdom activity are engaged in and a circuit assembly was held in the city during the year. On this occasion the publishers from all Ireland were in attendance and a splendid witness was given, but following the assembly pressure was brought to bear and the press published the usual crop of lies to counteract all the interest aroused. The chief accusation being “Communists”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up and down the country the call was made upon the government to ban Jehovah’s witnesses. In Drogheda a massed meeting of Catholics was convened. This was presided over by the mayor and “a resolution was unanimously passed calling upon the department of justice to take the necessary steps to instigate legislation which would ban from the country a sect known as Jehovah’s witnesses”. A vigilance brigade was formed with hundreds of young men and women enlisted to fight against these activities. The next day the public press carried headlines as follows: “Drogheda Meeting’s Call to the Government.” Such is the practice in Eire when a few pioneer sisters take up the quiet and peaceable proclamation of the Bible truths. During the course of the meeting it was stated by one speaker, “It is unfortunate that there were Catholic people in the town who were prepared to listen to these people,” and so there was admission that Interest was aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One priest said to his parishioners: “I am not going to suggest what methods you should adopt but I advise you to get rid of these people as quickly as possible.” In this way, the ignorant people are aroused to take action that we know of only too well, and the responsibility rests with the clergy for the mob action which so often follows. Not all, however, are so easily hoodwinked by these false charges. It was to help all such that it was considered advisable to prepare a folder setting out the facts. This was done and thousands of these folders have been distributed with the people. The folder is entitled: “Conspiracy Against the Truth or Liberty to Proclaim It—Which Do You Favor? Read, Then Choose Wisely.” There is good reason to believe that this folder has had the effect of aiding the honest people to know the facts, but, as is to be expected, the clergy and their dupes have been stirred to further opposition. They are now embittered as never before and they are concerned at the progress being made. No other religious body has dared to show active opposition by declaring what they know to be the facts concerning Catholic domination.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Some time ago the government of Malta took action against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, being determined to prevent the spread of the Kingdom message. Roman Catholic domination of the population is practically complete. The Gilead brethren who were assigned to Malta some time ago were removed by the government of Malta. However, the Kingdom message is still being preached by one faithful resident of the island. We rejoice with this brother in his service under the direction of the London office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One lone brother reports to us monthly concerning his witnessing. It is good to know that there is no power on earth that can entirely shut the mouths of those who know of Jehovah’s purposes and want to tell their neighbors about it. The Kingdom message continues to be delivered and we rejoice to know that some at least will hear despite the efforts of the Devil to suppress it entirely. We trust that by some means there will yet be an expansion of the witness to the people of Malta while the opportunity remains. Some literature is being distributed among good-will interest and back-calls are made. We are happy to record this brother’s share in the song of praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The branch office for the British West Indies is located on the island of Trinidad in the city of Port of Spain. All of the islands in the British West Indies with the exception of Jamaica come under the direction of this branch office. In order to keep in close association with all of the companies on the various islands, circuit servants are sent from place to place, missionary homes have been established on a number of them, and pioneers have been assigned to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. There has been a splendid increase in the work accomplished in all of these islands as many people have taken their stand for the truth during 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a 43 per cent increase in number of publishers, and all other features of the work have had corresponding growths. There is still much room for expansion, as not all of the islands have been reached as yet. However, the Society’s ship, the “Sibia”, plies these waters and visits many of the islands. When interest is found it is brought to the attention of the branch office for the British West Indies. A report of the progress in this Caribbean territory is quite interesting, as furnished by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting campaign continues to have Jehovah’s blessing with nearly twice as many talks being given this past year as during the previous year. The humble folk of many of these islands so love to hear God’s Word and his precious promises discussed that in many places all one has to do is to start talking to someone about the Bible. Before long a crowd gathers. It is then a simple matter to give a talk. In this way one small company of about 40 publishers augmented their regular public meeting series from the Kingdom Hall and book-study centers and held the phenomenal number of 248 public meetings during the year, an average of better than 20 talks a month. One company reported 46 talks in one month, another 31 and 27, and others from 15 to 20 are quite frequent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much of the hitherto isolated territory has been penetrated this past year by the missionaries on the Society’s schooner “Sibia”. Excellent results have been found and a wonderful field of activity has been planted with the seeds of truth. All that is needed now are some energetic pioneers who will be willing to go and water these seeds of truth. Certainly untold blessings await them in Jehovah’s service of praise. One pioneer sister has already done this and her faith has been rewarded with a threefold increase in placements and studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been many years since the smaller islands like the British Virgins, Anguilla and the Grenadines have been covered with the Kingdom message. The latter, a group of small, pretty islands strung like emeralds in a sea of turquoise and ringed about with beautiful, white sandy beaches, lying between St. Vincent and Grenada, is where the floating missionary home “Sibia” is presently working. Truly, the joyful reports of the missionaries are inspiring as they report experience upon experience among the truth-hungry people there. Last March, In passing south through the islands, a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> book was placed with one lady. In September, opportunity to make a back-call on her was had as the boat worked its way north. She admitted she had not attended church for many years. When asked why, she simply confessed, “I was in the Anglican church and the priest was bringing around an image of Jesus for the congregation to kiss. I felt terrible, for I had read in a book that it was wrong to do this, and the book proved it from the Bible. At last I could stand it no longer but jumped up and fled from the church, never to return.” The name of the book? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Enemies!</span><span class="font4"> A study was started at once and at the second study eight persons attended, for she had gone among all her neighbors to tell them to come in to the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the same village a man who had not attended church for twenty years obtained </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> A study was started with him and, convinced that he had at last found the truth, he was found the next day by one of the missionaries going from house to house inviting people to come to his study and learn as he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still another experience will serve to show the fruitful field that awaits some pioneers who are willing to go there when the missionaries on the “Sibia” must go to other fields of service. A lady had obtained a Bible and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> book in March. A back-call was made and a study held. Upon finishing, the missionary asked to what religion she belonged. “None,” she replied, “I left religion many years ago after reading a book called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> and one </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp of God.</span><span class="font4"> I saw the need of being baptized,” she continued, “and then a man called Ross who was of no religion came around preaching from the Bible. I asked him if he would baptize me, not into any religion, but just to serve God.” Such faith as this must have its reward, and now she is taking her stand for the new world. “It is a joy, indeed, to see her face light up when she is visited,” the missionary concludes. In the first week there one missionary was able to start 13 home Bible studies. Surely the field is white unto harvest!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This report would be incomplete if we said nothing about the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York city, July 30 to August 6, climaxing a grand year of service to Jehovah. Upward of 50 brethren were privileged to attend from these parts and the rich spiritual nourishment and blessings they received will long be remembered. Three district assemblies are being held shortly that are patterned after the New York assembly and this should do much in helping expand the work in this part of the vineyard. We look forward to great increase in the coming years. This will continue to pile up a greater heap of witness in vindication of God’s name and his Word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A few communications have been received from Bulgaria. Jehovah’s witnesses in that land are under strict surveillance by the government, and they are forbidden to preach the gospel of the Kingdom to anyone. A new law in Bulgaria forbids anyone in the land to be in contact with a religious organization in a foreign country, and any person corresponding with an organization outside of Bulgaria is considered a fascist or an agent for Anglo-America. We are sure, though, that our brethren communicate with one another and that, as they have opportunity, they preach the word as it is set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the brethren were able to meet together to observe the Memorial of our Lord’s death, but to meet for any other purpose would mean their being thrown into jail. It is a terrible thing to live under totalitarian rule where a man is forbidden to express even that which his Creator ordained should be declared. God has recorded that ‘this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness’, but man has said this may not be done on earth. There is nothing left for God to do except to destroy such nations. These rulers are fighting against God, but they cannot win.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Two-thirds of the 18 million people that live in Burma are Burmese Buddhists, and they do not believe in the existence of a Creator. It is easily seen from the very start that it would be difficult to talk to these people, and much groundwork must be laid first. However, we find a steady increase in publishers in this country, the number rising from 57 in 1949 to 70 in 1950, an increase of 23 per cent. There was a peak of publishers of 87 in the month of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Burma; however, they do have many trials and obstacles to overcome. The rebellion against the government has made it difficult to carry on the witness work. This state of affairs interferes greatly with the preaching of the gospel. There is great need for more Gilead-trained brethren in Burma; however, while the government shows tolerance toward the brethren already there, it refuses to allow more graduates of Gilead school to enter the country for the present. It is sincerely hoped that when the political difficulties subside more brethren can be sent into this country to care for the interested people. The branch servant sent us a good report of happenings there in the past service year, and all will read it with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1950 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> reported the organizing of a company of 12 publishers at Thinganaing village, about 100 miles from Rangoon. Very shortly thereafter this village was wiped out by a ruthless gang of dacoits (robbers). Not only did our brethren lose all their possessions, Bible literature and homes, but one of them was also murdered. The rest were thereafter scattered throughout insurgent-held territory and practically all contact with them was lost, except in the case of faithful brother Po Lay, who is now caring for his invalid son in a refugee camp, and who endeavors to report regularly to the branch office. Through him we have learned that several more of the original 12 brethren, including his wife, forming the Thinganaing company, have died as a result of hardships suffered during the past year. Brother Po Lay, however, still continues to witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name. May the day soon come, by Jehovah’s grace, when we can again get in personal contact with these dear brethren and give them the aid and instruction they so sorely need!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many are the Interesting experiences reported from the Maymyo company and two pioneers in northern Burma. Some of these brethren, too, were in the midst of severe fighting for many days and spent several nights in trenches while mortars barked in the background and machine-gun bullets whistled overhead. By God’s grace they came through without a scratch and have done wonderful work since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our most encouraging experience with the Burmese people of good will is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A person who was of a sheeplike disposition was contacted and a book study was started with him in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> His wife was a Burmese Buddhist who did not understand English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The husband advanced rapidly and was soon talking to everyone he met, including all those in his office and anyone who called at his home. Unfortunately, due to the language difficulty and the fact that there was no literature at that time in Burmese, the publisher was unable to explain the truth to the wife, and the husband became so full of zeal that he neglected his household chores. The wife became violently opposed and interfered with the studies, so much so that one day as the husband and publisher studied together they were heavily bombarded with kitchen utensils hurled by the angry wife. Obviously something had to be done! Wisely the husband arranged for a Burmese-speaking sister to call and explain the truth to the wife, using the newly received Burmese booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> Imagine the joy of the husband and the brethren when the wife began to take an interest in the truth! In fact, the time came when she was inviting publishers in almost every day to assist her to understand the Bible and also the English language. Now she, too, is filled with the Lord’s spirit, attends Kingdom Hall meetings with her four small children, and has become a regular publisher, the first Burmese publisher in Rangoon, if not in all Burma!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A sister reports a joyful experience as a result of following up a magazine placement in territory which is largely Catholic, and far from home. She writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While in the door-to-door work I met a Roman Catholic lady with whom I left a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. A week later I called again and asked her if she had read it. She said ‘yes’ but that she had not quite understood it. However, her husband had understood it because he, being a Protestant, is more familiar with the Bible. Her face beamed with joy when I suggested a course in home Bible study. But she suggested that I call after 6 p.m. when the whole family would be at home. On the appointed evening I went accompanied by a Gilead brother, as it is not safe for a woman to go about alone after dark. The whole family were ready and waiting for us. During the first few calls we cleared up their doubts and discussed the signs of the end, etc. After that we launched out on the study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Right after the first call the man of the house said: ‘Remember, you are always welcome here.’ Hardly had they studied with us a month on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> when we found that the altar and statues they had were removed and members of the family began to come out in field service. When this lady met the group for the first time she told them quite excitedly what had happened and how she would not worship idols any more but would now worship only the true and living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Discussing the importance of preaching, the husband said, ‘I realize I must preach, but since my hours of work are such that I cannot go out with the rest of you, I can at least preach right in my office; so may I have some booklets to distribute?’ Three months have now gone by and we hear that the father is now encouraging his boys to take up fulltime work. We are overjoyed and thankful to Jehovah that he has given us a share in this grand work of taking care of his sheep. This experience and other similar ones spur us on to greater effort.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far the only publishers in Burma who have responded to the pioneer call are sisters, now five, all married. These sisters are doing wonderful and courageous work in a country where women working alone are apt to become objects of unwelcome attention. Surely these faithful souls are pleasing to their heavenly Father and set an example that many brothers could well follow! We hope they will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are many persons in Canada who fully realize that the spirit of God is upon them to preach. From one end of the country to the other a good work is being performed by Jehovah’s witnesses. There was a 12 per cent increase during the 1950 service year, with an average of 16,013 publishers. A peak was reached in the month of April with a record number of 18,709 publishers. The brethren in Canada appreciated the convention very much. Being so close to the United States and the convention site, many of them came. The branch servant gives us an idea of how they felt and other high lights of Canadian activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rejoicing in the celebration of Theocracy’s increase we all were thrilled to hear and observe the great things Jehovah is accomplishing for us in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">synteleia</span><span class="font4"> period. For months all had been looking forward to being at New York to meet the many thousands of brethren from all parts of the world. The publishers here were determined to be at the convention regardless of the distance or sacrifice. Result: approximately 10,000 Canadians attended. Seven special trains carried the conventioners over the iron road, many traveled by air, and, of course, thousands by automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The marvelous blessings experienced there are well known, but the effects, the conviction, the strengthening of faith, will bear rich fruitage in the future months. Delighted we were to accept the invitation to enter the beautiful Bethel home and express our gratitude to the Lord for providing his loyal, lovable people with such a building so well equipped. Then to see the factory and the machinery which has been installed; to witness the sincerity and alacrity of our brethren serving there! Many were able to visit Staten Island and see WBBR. So as to make it possible for many Canadians to visit Gilead, stopovers at the nearby railroad stations were arranged and special buses were engaged to transport the hundreds who were anxious to see that marvelous center of theocratic education. Also hundreds of brethren en route to or returning from New York called in at the Toronto Bethel, and, much to their pleasure, were taken on a tour of the property, and we were so grateful to have them visit us in Toronto too. The happiness and love of all the publishers was so very manifest throughout their journey, at the convention, and wherever they went!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the commencement of the service year we were all busily engaged in building during the evenings, at week ends and when possible during the days, extending our premises to provide more room for the various departments. An extra floor to house a beautiful new office was built, the old office being converted into a shipping room, and the former shipping room now enlarging our storage space. It has been a real pleasure to work in the office with its greatly increased space, light, ventilation and organization, all of which has made for added efficiency in all departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Forty-one Canadians graduated from the 14th class at Gilead last February, seventeen of whom were assigned to missionary service overseas, and the remainder were commissioned to serve in the Quebec “foreign assignment”. It was good news especially for the graduates serving in Quebec to learn of your decision to consider Quebec as a “foreign assignment” and to know it would be dealt with in exactly the same manner as other far-off missionary fields. The faithful and capable service of these brethren in Quebec province has assuredly made tremendous inroads into this special Hierarchy preserve of 3i million population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are now 164 full-time ministers in Quebec, 83 general and 81 special pioneers, 63 of this latter group being Gilead graduates. How wonderful to realize that four years ago there were only 18 company organizations (8 French and 10 English) caring for the needs of some 300 brethren, whereas today there are 36 companies (21 French and 15 English) serving well over 1,000 brethren. We now are printing the French </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informateur</span><span class="font4"> instead of mimeographing it, bringing added pleasure to our French-speaking brethren. Great joy was expressed when announcement was made of the new publication in their language, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font4"> for much work yet has to be done in Quebec province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The campaign with half a million of the special issue (April 8) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines was enthusiastically pushed in 200 towns and villages in Quebec, also throughout the country. Its distribution brought to the surface many persons, even Catholics and residents of Quebec, who are entirely out of harmony with the tactics and policy of the Vaticanites, and numerous expressions of appreciation were made to our brethren during the campaign. One lawyer who has been closely associated with the Duplessis political machine phoned to this office from 600 miles away and declared that he was surprised and shocked to learn of the unrighteous acts of the Catholic Church and of those in authority in Quebec, and definitely stated his disapproval of the same, offering freely and without charge to associate himself with our legal counsel in the courts and fight for our rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year the fight in the courts has continued, much having been reported in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine. We are now awaiting the decision in the well-known </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Boucher</span><span class="font4"> vs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The King </span><span class="font4">case, our outstanding sedition case. This was the case which</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">brought us a partial victory before the five Supreme Court judges, when one of their number, Mr. Justice Rand, wrote an eloquent Indictment of the maladministration of justice in the province of Quebec. This judgment is one of the finest on record and, among other things, he states therein:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here are conscientious professing followers of Christ who claim to have been denied the right to worship in their own homes and their own manner and to have been jailed for obeying the injunction to ‘teach all nations’ . . . it is not challenged that, as they allege, whatever they did was done peaceably, and, as they saw it, in the way of bringing the light and peace of the Christian religion to the souls of men and women. To say that is to say that their acts were lawful. Whether, in like circumstances, other groups of the Christian Church would show greater forbearance and earnestness in the appeal to Christian charity to have done with such abuses, may be doubtful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prospects for the new year are thrilling. The Lord has granted us abounding joy in our service to him during the past year. He has now adequately equipped us with the marvelous new publications released at New York in the midst of the assembly of our spirit-filled brethren. The bold and uncompromising messages against godless communism and against the philosophies of “science falsely so called” will surely arm us well for combat in this dark world. What a favored and happy people we are to be living in these last days before the telic end, chosen as witnesses of Jehovah and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, the new world’s King. Therefore by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we are determined to go forward without letup, using all our strength, all our time, all our heart’s devotion in praising his holy name, exalting his King, and preaching his Word, for we know that “this means everlasting life”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The spirit of Theocracy’s increase is very clearly demonstrated by the brethren in Chile. They work very hard and willingly in Jehovah’s service. During the year the Lord blessed the efforts of the publishers greatly by gathering together many of the “other sheep” class into his organization. This was accomplished mainly through the back-call and Bible-study activity. Back-calls alone increased from 24,093 in 1949 to 40,827 in 1950. Bible studies jumped from an average of 328 to 588 each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Society sent a number of new missionaries into the field and opened up missionary homes in different cities. All of this added stimulus to the work, and at the same time the Chilean brethren and people of good will responded to the good news of the Kingdom. We rejoice in their excellent increase, and the branch servant writes in his report of the enthusiasm of the brethren and how they have put forth every effort to achieve these gains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were some problems In the way of steady expansion. For years the vacation months of January and February had been one of these. Why couldn’t the publishers take advantage of their vacation freedom by working more, instead of less? The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> reports from different countries have shown that improvements had been made by stressing that point. A very timely opportunity presented Itself right at the beginning of the vacation period. A very successful circuit assembly was held in Valparaiso and there that point was stressed. The publishers saw their privilege and, instead of a drop, a new peak was reached I That was the start of something that hardly any publisher in Chile could have expected. The company publishers and pioneers quickly caught up the spirit of expansion manifested by the missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new series of talks increased the public meeting activity. At the same time a unit In Santiago made arrangements for expansion by moving into a very well located hall. It was filled during their first series. About half in attendance represented new interest. It was found that four or five thousand mimeographed invitation slips served to help fill the hall, and they cost much less than printed handbills. With so much activity, time was passing quickly and with it a successful climax to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign was reached. The reports for April showed the third consecutive peak, of 375 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June brought a new high of twenty-one public meetings, three more pioneers, and the fifth consecutive peak, with 428 publishers! It may have seemed to many that the limit had been reached, because sixteen missionaries were leaving for the New York convention. Before their departure, arrangements were made to get all of their good-will interest into the field service where possible and other publishers were assigned to help them along during the absence of those about to leave. This proved to be very effective and brought out 481 In July for the sixth consecutive peak! Nineteen more and then the 500 mark!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrival of more missionaries was a very timely provision by the Society. Publishers were on the increase but they needed attention during the absence of the missionaries who were attending the international assembly. This need was filled by the brethren of the new group, as they were talking Spanish sufficiently by then to care for the work. This was shown in different places. In Valparaiso four brothers finished the service year with a peak of 45 publishers. The company there averaged 28, to compare with 11 for the previous year. Two brothers were sent to help the Concepcidn company, which continued growing from Its previous average of 17 to 31 and the August peak was 48! From the southern city of Temuco came reports of monthly increases in spite of steady wintertime rains. The six brothers in the new home there began in February with no company publishers but it grew to a peak of 30 in August and the average was 17 for their few busy months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Santiago, meetings were arranged to relate the convention news as it was received. Also a public meeting was held where 435 persons attended. The same hall was used when you, Brother Knorr, visited us in March, 1949. Now, however, there was evidence of as much interest in Santiago alone as there was In all Chile just a year and a half ago. The greatest high in enthusiasm was yet to come when the publishers heard the unexpected news about so many new releases in Spanish which you presented at the assembly. That proved to be just what was needed. The publishers went forth to show their appreciation by bringing in reports from a grand total of 547 publishers to climax the service year with its seventh consecutive peak! The monthly average shows 71 per cent more publishers than last year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This calls to mind 1 Corinthians 3:6,“ . . . but God kept making it grow.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(New 'World Translation)</span><span class="font4"> The brethren appreciate the many provisions which the Lord, in his undeserved kindness, has provided through his visible organization. Our prayer is that each one may keep watching how he is building on the only true foundation, Jesus Christ, that his works may remain in the New World society to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Big changes are taking place in the political and economic conditions of China. Nevertheless, on the mainland we find a small group of publishers preaching the gospel, while a group of missionaries are located at Hong Kong; and more faithful servants of the Lord, but lacking leadership, are going ahead with the work on Tai Wan. All of these publishers behold the King Christ Jesus through their eyes of faith, and are looking to the Kingdom as the only hope for the world. They faithfully preach the good news and call to the attention of the people the presence of the glorious King Christ Jesus and the new world now so near. In certain parts of China there has been an increase. The decrease in Tai Wan is due mainly to the fact that reports are not coming through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Shanghai a great re-educational work is being pushed by the new communistic government. The people are being taught the theory of evolution along with the communistic ideology. Even while such teachings are being forced upon the people, there are some who are listening to the truth and are happy to hear it. A sufficient number are coming into the truth to make those preaching the Word feel it is worth while. The branch servant sent in the report following, which shows you some of the difficulties that have been encountered by the servants of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Interested people are not backward in telling others about the truth and inviting them to join in the studies. They very willingly act as translators for the Gilead graduates in the home Bible-study work as well as share in the house-to-house work. Typical is the example of one pioneer who placed a book with a man engaged in giving private English lessons. A study was started at the first return visit and thereafter the man invited all his students into the study and many attended regularly. One young man showed exceptional Interest and a separate study was arranged with him. After a short time he joined in the field service and also started conducting a study with a schoolmate. His cousins also joined in, and it was not long before they too were sharing in the house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much of our progress has been with persons already professing Christianity. A pioneer contacted a woman who said she would like to have “Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> for her daughter, as she was considering joining the Catholic church and becoming a nun. The mother was a Protestant. A study was arranged with the daughter and she soon saw that the Catholic church was not the true church. She really enjoyed her studies, and soon the mother realized her daughter knew more of the Bible than she did, so she too joined the study. Both have made excellent progress and are glad that they have at last found the truth of God’s Word and the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hong Kong is just a small pocket under the great land mass of China and quickly fills or empties according to the fortune of the mainland. During the year it has filled to the bursting point with refugees and travelers in transit. So the Gilead graduates there have conducted studies with people who have later moved off to various parts of China, Tai Wan, America, England, and Australia. It is hoped their planting will some day bear fruit in some far-flung corner of the globe. Reporting on their experiences there the missionaries sent us the following interesting account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here as elsewhere the clergy have muddied up the waters and are still busy with the same old tools. In one Interested home a Protestant parson said we were ‘Catholic fathers’ who did not teach from the Bible. This was very funny to the householder, who had never seen so much of the Bible as from the witnesses. One minister’s wife took a book at the door and when the back-call was made the minister brought up the subject ‘trinity’ and soon got all heated up. He had indicated that he would continue the discussion but soon bowed his way out. Not long after, however, when visiting at a home a young high school student proudly displayed his copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> and was amazed to see the clergyman go into a mad rage and order the book to be burned. But the book was not burned, for after the boy got over his astonishment he figured that the clergyman was angry because of lost attendance at church. From that time there were never less than five at that boy’s study. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> has caused much apprehension to false religion and has been worriedly referred to as ‘that green book’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“For the past five months we have had the welcome addition of the two Gilead missionaries from Tai Wan and we are looking forward to being joined by a Chinese graduate of the 14th class. We are still working among the Englishspeaking people of this teeming city, and there is very much to be done. The parts where Chinese only is spoken are virtually untapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The witnesses’ work in Tai Wan has met up with serious difficulties during the year, due to government opposition. The two Gilead graduates recently arrived there have fought hard to obtain recognition and freedom for the brethren to meet together. But even they were ordered to leave Tai Wan and during February were deported. It appears that the Tai Wan government does not like to see the humble Ami tribes people be enlightened from the Word of God. With the Gilead graduates in their midst helping them to study many were enthused into action and in August, 1949, a peak of 248 publishers was in the field. This stirred up the ire of the enemy. Brethren were called in for questioning by the police. Cruel beatings and brutal treatment were used, but the brethren stood firm, declaring: ‘We love Jehovah and worship him. Kill us if you want but till death we will love Jehovah.’ Two of the brethren who have done much to advance the work in Tai Wan were detained and are still in prison without charges or court trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Gilead missionaries did all they could for the defense of the local brethren and calls were made upon police and local officials to fully explain the nature of the work. In support, a petition, signed by heads of families of those in the truth stating that the two imprisoned brethren were not ‘rogues’ as charged, was presented, but local officials would do nothing. So the matter was taken to the Provincial government in Taipeh city. The authorities there were surprised to have a visit from Brother McGrath, as they had sent a letter to the missionaries via the Taitung magistrate. This letter, which was never delivered to the missionaries though they repeatedly asked for it, was to grant them freedom to preach and hold meetings, and to have police protection when traveling from village to village. But here again the authorities would not act on behalf of the freedom of the brethren but carried on shifting the responsibility to other departments. Copies of the latest publication were left with heads of the various departments so that they were fully informed on who Jehovah’s witnesses are and their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Being a spectacle unto men and angels lets everyone know just what kind of people Jehovah’s witnesses are. The two brethren in prison were soon given positions of trust because of their honesty. They were sent out of the prison without guards to obtain money from the bank and purchase supplies for the prison. Everywhere they went they preached, and this brought good results. ‘You have a good religion,’ said the warders. ‘You do not steal or cause trouble; so go right ahead and preach to these bad men and maybe they will repent and be good,’ they said. So for a period each day prisoners and warders listened to the Scriptural hope of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is certain now that the officials of the government had no intention of allowing the two missionaries to remain with the local brethren, yet so hypocritically did they act that right up to the time of deportation orders it looked as if the difficulties would be smoothed out entirely. Then the missionaries were ordered to leave Taitung, their assignment, and proceed to Taipeh city. Leaving the local brethren was a very sad thing for them. Hundreds came to the station to see them off and thank them for their help and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Arriving at Taipeh city the missionaries were confronted with the charge of being Communists, but no opportunity was afforded to refute this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As they sailed away leaving the bleak shores of Tai Wan behind, their hearts were heavy at leaving brethren they loved so much. Gladly they will return when Jehovah opens up the way again.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As the curtain falls on the 1950 service year, those who have shared in the past twelve months in declaring Jehovah as King can look back over the time with great joy. It has been a season of refreshment, one of success for the zealous Kingdom publishers; and they are determined now, by the Lord’s grace, to go ahead with a new year, looking for even greater gains. Colombia had a 48 per cent increase in number of publishers, reaching a new peak of 162 witnesses for the Lord. In Colombia many obstacles, including revolutions, have hindered the truth, but despite all these the faithful servants of the Lord have been richly blessed and are now pressing on with determined effort to see to it that Theocracy’s increase will continue. The branch servant gives us some very interesting comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding among the opening acts was the anxiously-awaited visit of the Society’s president to Colombia for the second time. His audiences were not disappointed. A three-day stay by the president and his secretary at the Bogota branch office and missionary home proved a real stimulus to the local company and to the isolated publishers that had traveled to the capital to see them. It was at the coastal missionary home in Barranquilla, however, that Brother Knorr’s visit reached a grand climax. Attendance records were rudely shattered when 261 persons packed out the Kingdom Hall to attentively hear the powerful lecture “Liberty to the Captives”. It was really something new for the brethren, since the discourse was given in English by Brother Knorr and in Spanish by an interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the heels of this came an influx of pioneers. The pioneer list increased from 4 to 11 and the monthly average of 109.4 hours testifies to their activity. At the year’s end two were chosen to be special pioneers and to open up new fields of service in Cartagena, a city of upward of 100,000 population previously untouched by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Memorial time the Bogota company showed a flourish of enthusiasm. A baptism service was arranged for in the tropical country two hours from the city and it was hoped that enough brethren would go to charter a 30-passenger bus. As word got around and money was turned in it was found that a 45-passenger bus would be needed. At departure the special bus was packed and more than 20 others were forced to go on the regular bus line. The discourse was given on a grassy slope near a mountain stream and 11 candidates were Immersed. A picnic lunch, a witnessing party in the small </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font4"> nearby and then a return trip up the picturesque mountain road ended a happy day and the first “get-together” by the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stealing the show, however, was the Barranqullla company. It jumped from 7 to 46 publishers in 1949 and then this past year wound up with an 84 average and a final August peak of 104 publishers. The spirit of love and enthusiasm for the witness work that exists among the brethren is something to behold. Here is how they come into the truth there: A Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> was placed with a man on Tuesday morning. Thursday evening he was present for the service meeting, and having already read the book he was invited to go along on some home Bible studies. Shortly thereafter he was conducting studies himself and rapidly became a good publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another Barranquilla scene. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> (Spanish) was placed with a businessman who had been reading the Society’s publications since 1935. Now, after 15 years’ pondering, he saw the truth, the need for organization, meetings and service. Due to zealous activity and rapid advance he symbolized his consecration six weeks later. This aroused his Catholic wife. But, one month passes and what does she do? Why, invite her husband to help tear down and destroy her just-previously adored mass of images. She too is now a good publisher and takes every opportunity to preach in her husband’s store. As a result her “goaty” niece now attends meetings and is publishing the good news also. The man left his business in order to attend the New York convention although unable to speak English. He returned spurred on to do more increasing himself. The pioneer ranks were happy to receive him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a thrilling climax came the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York. Ten brethren from Colombia were privileged to attend and returned flowing over with the enthusiasm of joyful Christian association and a firsthand view of a marvelous outpouring of the Lord’s spirit upon his people. They could hardly find words capable of describing the wonderful things they experienced at the convention. With the absence of several of the missionaries local brethren were given responsibilities of conducting </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, service meetings and the theocratic ministry school and carrying on other duties in the company organizations. They played their parts well and as a result we are gradually replacing missionaries with Colombian publishers in positions as servants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the Word was begun in 1913 in Costa Rica, but it has .been in the past seven years that the work has taken on greater impetus. At that time graduates of Gilead were first sent into the land and better theocratic organization was introduced. From then on Theocracy’s increase has been most manifest. The people of good will are turning away from the old, dying system of this world, being refreshed by a study of the truth, and then preaching it to others. Costa Rica moves ahead again with a 21 per cent increase in number of publishers and now has a peak of 1,345. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From December 29, 1949, to January 1, 1950, saw Jehovah’s witnesses in their district assembly in San Jos6. Brother Morgan was here for the opening day and Brother Knorr came on the second day to aid and counsel the Costa Rican publishers for the preaching work ahead. Appropriately on December 31 Brother Knorr spoke on “Preach the Word”, and as he reached the climax of his talk the ushers, by means of cords, lowered into place over the old one, the 1950 yeartext banner, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Preach the word.”</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah’s servants here have seen the importance of preaching, and as a result 196 persons more are now preaching to yet others. This is a 21 per cent increase over the previous year’s average number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is Interesting to note that our total Memorial celebration attendance was 1,345 and that that number should be our peak in publishers for the year. However, had all the companies and pioneers reached their peaks in the same month we would have shown 1,476 publishers. This means that we have this many at least associated with the various companies and gives us something to work on during the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding is the company of Argentina de Tilarfin, up in the mountains near the Nicaraguan border. One Ione publisher there in that mountain wilderness was preaching to his neighbors, friends and relatives. In July of 1947 a company was organized there and two publishers reported that first month. From that time forward the number has steadily grown. In April of this year two members of the San Jost<sup>5</sup> Bethel office and missionary home had the privilege of visiting this company for a small assembly arranged to fall on the week end of the circuit servant’s visit. The first 180 kilometers were covered in about 45 minutes by plane, then a bus ride of an hour or so took the two to a fork in the road where the brethren had horses waiting, and a ride of about two hours finished the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the brethren were already there and others kept coming, some on foot, others on horses. One couple walked nine hours over mountain trails to get there and many rode all day to make the trip. They even brought their children. One mother brought her tiny infant in a sort of hammock arrangement that hung from her neck and shoulders. It must be remembered that in the vicinity of the Kingdom Hall there is neither town nor village, but when the count was taken on Sunday during the public meeting, 235 adults and some 50 children were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And during his visit there Brother Blackburn formed three new companies in this section, one at Canas, one at Arenal de TilarSn, and another at San Rafael de Guatuso. These along with the original company at Argentina de Tilarsln reported a total of 90 publishers for August, and this in just three years from the time that the two-publisher company was formed. Much of the progress is due to the good work of a native pioneer that has been working in that section during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit servants continually write the office about some of the wonderful things that they experience on the road visiting the brethren in these out-of-the-way places. Outstanding was the one sent in by Brother Blackburn concerning the Memorial week end in Santa Cruz. He writes: “Throughout the week good-will persons in Santa Cruz were informed about the celebration of the Memorial, Saturday, April 1, at 7:00 p.m. . . . Saturday evening at 6:00 p.m. we were skeptical as to whether we two pioneers would have to celebrate the most important of all occasions alone or not. We were filled with joy, when the discourse began, to see 13 persons present . . . All were well pleased and remained after the meeting, asking questions as to Sunday’s activities and the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was a great joy to have a new peak of 9 isolated publishers in the service with us on Sunday. In the early afternoon it was observed that the local meeting place in a private home would be too small for the public meeting. We went to a farm about two kilometers away to ask the owner of a club for the use of his building from 6:00 to 7: 00 p.m. He accepted the invitation to attend, as he said he wanted to see for himself what it was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was amazing to see 86 persons present, and, although many had to stand, all remained to the finish. While bidding me farewell the club owner said he would not accept money for the use of his hall, as he was more than paid, as the discourse explained his many questions until now unanswered. The next time we must use his hall again free and pay him a personal visit at his home. Enthusiasm ran high as we departed to our various homes, thanking Jehovah for blessing us and all righteously disposed persons throughout the earth during this season of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In Port Limon we were denied the use of the U. N. I. A. Hall for our circuit assembly there. Always before we had been able to get it, but this time the one in charge of renting it out refused it to us. So we held the assembly in and around the Kingdom Hall. The people of Port Limdn as a whole are friendly with Jehovah’s witnesses and several remarked that it was strange that they were refused the use of the Universal Negro Improvement Association Hall. A former committee member remarked that ‘it won’t always be the same’. A few days later the man that refused us the hall lost out in a court fight over its use by other members of the organization and now has nothing to do with the letting of it to others. The new committee has just recently granted us the use of the hall for our district assembly to be held there in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was good to be among loved ones of like precious faith and to mingle with the thousands of God’s ministers assembled in Yankee Stadium for eight days. This has given us renewed strength and vigor for the task ahead, and so it is with thanksgiving in our hearts that we herewith submit this seventh annual report of theocratic activities. Surely here as elsewhere The Theocracy Is on the increase, and, by Jehovah’s grace, we hope to continue to ‘preach the Word’ so that many more can yet swell the ever-increasing throngs that in this day of Jehovah are singing his praises.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers on the island of Chiba zealously and faithfully followed the admonition of the apostle Paul by preaching the Word during the past year. The results prove the blessing of the Lord on their activity. In fact, their devotion to the people of good will aided 1,500 to take their stand with the Lord’s organization, proclaiming the good news. Although there are now 7,505 publishers in Cuba since that peak was reached in July, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done in the land. There are approximately 17,000 persons associated with Jehovah’s witnesses, and many of these still need help to get a better understanding of the truth. This assistance is being given them through home Bible studies. In addition, there are thousands upon thousands of other honest-hearted, sincere persons who need the opportunity to learn of the Kingdom promises. Jehovah God is patiently giving the organization on earth more time to preach this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through the home Bible-study work in Cuba great advances have been accomplished. Of course, it meant going from door to door first, then starting back-calls and following through with the Bible-study work. The figures show a 35 per cent increase in Bible-study activity over the previous year. The branch servant gives us some reports as to just how the Cuban people feel about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of calling back and conducting studies is shown in the following experience reported by a pioneer. He says, “While working in our territory we made a back-call on a humble family of good will. After finishing the call, we promised to return the following week. However, due to many things coming up, we neglected to make this call. About two months later one of the young boys from this good-will family called at our house, and asked why we didn’t come to visit them any more. He said that practically his whole family had turned to spiritualism. His mother said that the fault was ours. If we had gone to their home and taught them about God and his purposes this wouldn’t have happened. Realizing our mistake in not calling back, we visited this family two days later and started a home Bible study with them. When we started the study with them they had an altar with 16 images on it. Three weeks after the study started they burned up all the images. And now, three weeks later, five members of this family are publishers for the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of publishers in the Habana metropolitan area continues to grow in leaps and bounds. At the present there are over 1,256 publishers in the ten units of Habana. There are prospects of shortly organizing three more units there. About six years ago, when the company book studies were first organized in the Habana company, one of the study groups had just 3 persons in attendance at its first meeting. This group has grown into an organized company with over 200 publishers reporting regularly. This same company had an attendance of 402 at the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One difficulty that some of the units in the city of Habana have is that of finding homes with a room large enough to hold their company book studies in. Many of the publishers are poor materially and live in very small homes that have rooms that are much too small for a company book study. One company remedied this difficulty by holding public meetings in the homes of some persons of good will who had large rooms in their homes. After the series of public talks was over they arranged for company book studies to be held in these homes. Concerning this the company servant of this company wrote the Society saying, “In one month we held three different series of public talks in the homes of persons of good will, and after these series were finished we organized company book studies in each one of these homes. At the conclusion of one of these series of public talks in one of the homes we announced that on the following week a book study would be held at the same hour in the same home. We thought that about 8 or 10 newly interested persons who heard the public lecture would attend. But imagine our surprise when 38 persons of good will attended the first study. About 35 of these good-will persons continued to attend this study weekly. Then later on all of them were invited to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and now almost every one of these 35 is a regular publisher for the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the brethren from here were able to attend the international convention in New York. Most of them, being poor in this world’s goods, made great sacrifices in order to attend. One pioneer brother, who was not able to attend the 1946 convention in Cleveland, due to lack of funds, saved American quarters in a jar for four years in order to be able to attend the next International convention. We started as far back as October in making arrangements to help many of the brethren obtain their passports. A great majority of those going to New York left In a group on three big chartered planes from Habana. When these planes left there were over 1,000 brethren at the airport to bid them good-bye. When we arrived at the Miami airport the Customs authorities showed the same discrimination against us as they did to the European brethren when they entered the United States through New York. In practically every case the immigration authorities shortened the stay of the brethren to August 15. Two of the brethren were detained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After much questioning and delay the group got through Customs. Four chartered Greyhound buses that were waiting for us outside the airport drove us on to New York. Although a great majority of our delegates did not understand English they greatly rejoiced in being present and seeing the Lord’s spirit manifest upon his people assembled in convention. Most of the delegates stayed in homes of Spanish-speaking people. They talked the truth to these people at every opportunity they had. Many of them were able to bring their landladies and their families to the stadium to hear the talks. When it came time for departure many of the landladies refused to accept money for rent from the brethren. When the delegates left New York to come back many of the landladies came out to the bus terminal to bid them good-bye. All returned home greatly enthused and animated. The effects of this assembly upon our brethren should result in still further increases in activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new publications in Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘‘This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘‘Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font4"> will be of very great aid to the publishers in this country. The brethren here greatly appreciate these two new provisions from the Lord. The semimonthly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> will greatly increase our placements in magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the publishers here have been richly and abundantly blessed of the Lord. All are looking forward to the coming service year that it too, by the Lord’s grace, may be one of great expansion to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is a joy to reflect on the many blessings that Jehovah pours out over His servants and to rehearse the mighty acts of the Creator toward his creatures. The command to “preach the word” applies not only to the great nations of the world, but even to the small, less-progressive islands of the sea. In the Mediterranean there is a well-known, ancient island, Chittim, now known as Cyprus. It was often referred to in the Hebrew Scriptures as well as in the Greek. Since there are people living there, it is the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to carry the message to the people of that island just as Paul carried it there in the first eentury of our Christian era. It is a joy to know that there was a 45 per cent increase in number of publishers and that a new peak of 242 was reached during the year. These publishers have caused their fellow islanders to take notice of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the branch servant gives us some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By far the most outstanding event of the year was our circuit assembly held at Paphos. As soon as it was known that Jehovah’s witnesses would be holding an assembly, the bishop who resides in the town together with other prominent personalities set about to stop the assembly. However, knowing that Jehovah’s hand is ever overshadowing his servants, we went forward determined to overcome every obstacle that our enemies would put before us and by his grace we held the most blessed assembly to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days before the assembly started the hall we had engaged was denied us, but providently at the last minute another place was secured. The bishop then issued a leaflet warning the people against this “Satanic invention of the unhealthy imagination of the last century”, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses. “Strictly prohibit their entrance to your homes,” he warned, else “diseased as they are they communicate . . . their incurable and soul-destroying disease”. These leaflets were distributed throughout the town and stuck to walls and telegraph poles. However, the leaflet did not have the desired result, so the bishop issued two others and also addressed warnings to the religious and nationalist clubs in the town. The Young People’s Christian Association came to the bishop’s aid with another leaflet and these young people did “street work” with their leaflets alongside each publisher doing pavement work. The people finally showed their lack of interest in the warnings of the bishop when 500 filled the largest cinema in the town to hear the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The matter of advertisement did not end with the assembly ; in fact, it had only just begun. The newspapers began to report on the assembly, all unfavorably. The bishop engaged the same cinema that we had used and let forth a tirade against the Lord’s servants. Theologians and monks were dispatched in haste to all villages in the vicinity to sound the warning against us. Special persons with placards bearing the words, “Beware of the antichrist,” were engaged to stand alongside the local publishers when they engaged in street witnessing. However, they soon got tired of their job and quit. Even a local poet joined in the advertisement with a poem entitled “The New Antichrist”. Finally one newspaper bewailed the lethargy of the leaders of the Church of Cyprus in enlightening the people about the Word of God and said, “The followers of Jehovah already number in hundreds in our district, although even yesterday they could be counted on the fingers of one hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting work progressed well during the year, especially in the rural districts. In the villages it is not easy to make arrangements for meeting places and advertise the talk to be delivered. It is a case of taking advantage of opportunities. Seeing that many are Illiterate the public meeting work is particularly helpful. The summer is the only time that many of these villages can be visited, because of bad roads. So every Sunday will see a group of brethren traversing the dusty and rock-strewn tracks to some tranquil village reposing in the arms of an olive-clad valley. The menfolk spend their Sunday morning at the village center, the coffee shop. Reclining under the shade of a vine heavyladen with luscious grapes or sitting beneath the silverleaved olive or carob trees, is often the setting for a public talk. The tranquil village then awakens to a discussion of vital Bible truths. The village stream has been hushed by the summer’s heat, but a stream of “living water” begins to quench the thirst of the humble peasant. Groups of interested persons are being gathered together in this way, and in one village of 1,500 inhabitants a peak of 47 publishers reported field service during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The presence of the witnesses presenting the message in the streets has greatly upset the religious leaders. So the “sword of the church”, the Young People’s Christian Association, has been active in an endeavor to get us off the streets. Young men patrol the streets when the witnesses are about, and, like eagles waiting to swoop on their prey, so these wait for persons to approach the witnesses to take literature and then they will come forward and speak against us in an effort to turn these persons away. These young men had caused so much trouble in the streets that the police were informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several cases have come before the courts for assault of the brethren and destruction of their literature. Offenders were heavily fined. Judges in the courts made it quite clear that Jehovah’s witnesses, although a minority, have every right to preach the gospel wherever they like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest obstacle that has to be contended with in the islands is fear. Many persons of good will, who love the truth and will even defend Jehovah’s witnesses, refuse to attend meetings and take an active part in the proclamation of the message because of fear of losing their jobs. We await the time when Jehovah will loose the shackles of fear that hold back these people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Paul, in writing to the Christians, said that the word of God should be preached “in favorable season, in troublesome season”. (2 Tim. 4:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> The season is certainly unfavorable now for Jehovah’s witnesses ; but as the report received shows, the brethren are taking advantage of all opportunities for preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. Despite the fact that the work is banned, there has been an 86 per cent increase in the number of publishers in the past 12 months, raising the peak up to 2,882. This, of course, incurs the wrath of the communistic regime that controls Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The minister of the interior is on record as saying that the missionaries who have come into Czechoslovakia have no right in the country and that “we have no other choice than to send them back where they came from”. It is easy for the minister to dish out propaganda like this, but the facts show the charges to be lies. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has sent no missionaries into Czechoslovakia, and there are no missionaries in Czechoslovakia whom the government can deport, because all those preaching the gospel in that country are natives of Czechoslovakia. They are Christians and preach the good news of the Kingdom. The annual report gives us the details on how our brethren are being treated. But despite all hardships and ill-treatment, the work goes on and will continue to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name and word. The people of good will in Czechoslovakia will be found and blessed with the word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia are deprived of the freedom to proclaim the Word of God by holding public lectures. They are not allowed to meet for the study of Bible literature. It has been made impossible for them to publish magazines or other printed matter explaining the Bible, or to import from abroad, and all their literature was confiscated. They are not allowed to visit the people in their homes in order to acquaint them with the good news of the theocratic kingdom. Solely they are permitted, no, ordered to work for this old world and to participate actively in its reconstruction. Daily they are faced with the decision as to whether they want to persevere in their integrity before God or to make compromises that might, it is true, ease their present situation, but by which they would burden their consciences and lose favor with God. It is a daily fight to keep one’s heart pure before the Lord, a fight which requires strong nerves, and above all sincere faith and perfect devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The viewpoint of the government regarding our work was expressed by the minister of the interior, V. Nosek, in his speech to the Committee for Armaments and Security of the National Assembly, on March 23, 1950, in which he said, among other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I must also mention the activity of the so-called ‘missionaries’. From the West they send various missionaries such as . . . Bible Students, witnesses of Jehovah, and suchlike. Formerly we could read that missionaries spread their faith among colonial peoples where Christianity has not yet penetrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Indonesia, Viet Nam, Malaya, and other colonial countries, in which national revolutionary fights are in progress, are, it is true, no fit place today for the activity of such missionaries. The spreading of their false Christianity in Asia, Africa and Australia has not been successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“These missionaries, who have not been schooled in the study of the gospel of Christ, but have been trained in American army and navy academies or by special spy courses, have for this reason come to our country. Hence their activity has absolutely nothing in common with preaching the gospel of Christ, and so we have no other choice than to send them back where they came from. If these missionaries really want to preach the Word of God, peace and neighbor love according to the principles of Christ, then the best opportunity for them would be to do so on the American Wall Street.” (Quoted from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rudd Prdvo</span><span class="font4"> of March 24, 1950)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After sincere people, who know Jehovah’s witnesses, had read this speech in the press, they wondered very much how a man in the rank of cabinet minister could make such a knowingly untrue statement. God’s people now exclaim with David, who had to flee from the persecutions of Saul: “Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.”—Ps. 56: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some brethren have been imprisoned because they explained the Bible to others, and were released after a few days. Others have now been in prison for months and must expect legal proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we consider only the bans and trials put upon us by the world, then the time is truly very unseasonable to preach the Word. But Jehovah’s witnesses view the matter differently. In the first place, they have in their mind God’s commandment to preach and to persevere in the work under all circumstances. They take to heart the counsel of the apostle Paul who wrote in his epistle to the Hebrews: “Do not, therefore, throw away your freeness of speech, which has a great reward to be paid it.” (Heb. 10:35, JIW) The servants of God in Czechoslovakia have already now been richly rewarded for their perseverance and freeness of speech by the company of new publishers who, together with them, praise Jehovah, and to their great joy they are unceasingly rewarded by a multitude of hearing people of good will who hunger and thirst for the Word of God and look for life on the new earth under the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The year has seen steady growth of the number of those consecrating themselves to Jehovah’s service in Denmark. A new all-time peak of 4,936 publishers was reached. Like all their brethren throughout the world, they have enjoyed the rich spiritual food made available through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font5"> they have followed the instructions in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant;</span><span class="font5"> they have engaged in all fields of service, and this has made a good impression on the people of Denmark. Much newspaper comment has been forthcoming as a result of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The publishers have looked well to the Kingdom interests not only in Denmark itself but also in the islands belonging to Denmark, such as the Faroes and other islands near to the mainland. The pioneer in the Faroes has learned to utilize every opportunity in witnessing for the Kingdom. In order to provide the necessities of life for himself and his wife he represents a textile firm and as he travels from island to island he has many experiences in telling about the Kingdom. In practically every town he visits a public lecture is given. The branch servant’s report on what is occurring in Denmark follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witness given by these devoted servants of Jehovah has been so extensive and intensive that people have been compelled to take notice. Even those who are not well-disposed toward Jehovah’s witnesses comment from time to time on their zeal and devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a Copenhagen daily in which matters of a religious nature receive special attention, there was the following comment on the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“How the Danish Church (to use the words of a well-known man) deserves this wasp called Jehovah's witnesses. They make us ashamed of ourselves with (1) their energy and self-sacrifice; (2) their faith in God—instead of our belief in grace—as a means of missionary activity ; (3) their preparedness for martyrdom, when we recognize even ‘atomic murder’ as ‘the will of God’ which we must support ‘when other means fail’. Additionally, I would assert that if our church were in ‘word and deed’ as it should be, Jehovah’s witnesses would cease to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We would reiterate—If! But we feel there is little chance of the church making this change. There is more chance of sincere members of the church taking their stand for God and his kingdom together with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A patch—on an old garment”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps taking their cue from Jehovah’s witnesses, many Influential clergymen have been agitating for a greater Christian activity on the part of laymen. This presents real difficulties, however, as these men have not had the advantages of the theocratic ministry school, as have Jehovah’s servants, so that they can be “completely equipped for every good work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One clergyman writing in the press about this said: “But laymen must be equipped. When Jesus called his disciples it was not for a church existence In order to listen. No, he equipped them and sent them out. When one has met 22 Jehovah’s witnesses in the course of a quarter of an hour, and none from the state church, then one can understand that we are up against it. We are idle in our church even if we have legions of meetings. What we lack is the ability to give ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“You yourselves do not go in&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That some of the church leaders are realizing their helplessness is also illustrated by an incident at the yearly congress of the YMCA and YWCA at Nyborg. The leader of the Inner Mission movement speaking at the convention said that church life was on the decline in Denmark. The Inner Mission, he said, had had to sell mission halls because there was no need of them. It is a defeat, he said, but let us acknowledge it, and it is just the same the world over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of this it is passing strange that another section of the Mission movement recently voted that a sum of money be used for publishing a book against Jehovah’s witnesses, who are doing their best to enlighten people concerning God’s purposes and are finding many sincere inquirers who listen with joy to the truths of God’s Word. The words of Jesus come to mind, “You shut up the kingdom of the heavens before mankind; for you yourselves do not go in, neither do you permit those on their way in to go in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A little one shall become a thousand”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How different from the afore-mentioned are the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses! At these assemblies there is joy because of the expansion of the Christian work, by reason of the blessing of Jehovah. In the town where the district assembly was held last year, there has been a 28 per cent increase in number of publishers in 1950. We look forward to a grand assembly in Copenhagen at the end of September, when many of the blessings received at the international assembly at New York will be given to the expectant Danish publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Preach—and give a thorough witness”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public lectures in the open air are becoming more and more a feature of Kingdom activity. Typical of this blessed service is the experience of one company of Jehovah’s witnesses. They had just got some loud-speaker equipment and the witnesses were looking forward to the day when they would have the first opportunity to use it. The permission of the authorities had been obtained to give the lecture in a little wood just outside a village, and, as was natural, the Kingdom publishers were wondering just how the people in the village would react and how many would come to the lecture. The group of witnesses started their advertising work from house to house at 9 o’clock in the morning and at 12 noon they assembled in the woods to enjoy the lunch which they had brought with them and to encourage one another by relating experiences they had had in the work of proclaiming the gospel. At the end of the clearing in the woods, there was a sports club, and about 25 members of the club were present when Jehovah’s witnesses assembled to eat their lunch. As one could expect, the little group of Jehovah’s witnesses soon began to discuss recent world happenings and the fulfillment of prophecy in these events, with the members of the club.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meeting which began at 3 p.m. sharp was on the subject “It Is High Time to Awake!” and the club members took the hint and turned up in full force to hear what it was all about. Without exception the club members listened with rapt attention and even when friends came to visit them from the village, no excuse was made to quit but, on the contrary, the visitors were requested to listen to the lecture. From this village no less than 80 persons were finally assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“In all the inhabited earth&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses do all within their power to get the good news of the Kingdom proclaimed everywhere. Recently one of the witnesses, who by reason of a rather serious accident was not able to take so active a part in preaching the gospel as he formerly had done, witnessed all the more to his near relatives. Among them was a lady who was deaf and dumb, and she was married to a man who was similarly afflicted. Encouraged by the willingness of these people to examine the truths of the Scriptures, the Invalid witness began to wonder if something could not be done for the deaf and dumb on a larger scale. Where there is a will, often a way can be found, and the idea of this sick witness resulted in a lecture being arranged in a large home for deaf-and-dumb people. The lecture was interpreted by the use of finger signs and additionally the lecture was respoken by one especially trained for the purpose, so that those who were used to reading the language from the lips might be assisted. There were seventy present at the lecture and as a result of this fifteen are now regularly attending a Bible study organized by Jehovah’s witnesses. In the winter there will be a series of lectures arranged in the home and, by reason of the interest which has been aroused, it is expected that at least 200 will attend them. Already the ears of the deaf are unstopped to hear the heart-cheering message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion let me say how great a joy it was for us that so many brethren from Denmark were able to attend the international convention in New York and the enthusiasm of these brethren after this grand experience will doubtless be a blessing to others and mean added Impetus to the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Totalitarian rule is difficult to combat. For a Christian to live under the iron hand of a dictator, real courage and fortitude are required. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Dominican Republic are living under dictatorial rule, and great pressure was brought to bear against them during the 1950 service year of the Society. At present the government has a ban on the work. Jehovah’s witnesses are not allowed to talk to anyone about the Bible or to distribute Bible literature. Stop and think for a moment that this condition exists in a country of the Western Hemisphere, in a country that is a member nation of the United Nations! Yet the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is proud of its success in bringing about a ban on the work. They take the credit for stopping the work—and they will take the punishment from God for doing so. Things have come to a sorry state of affairs in a civilized world when the Catholic Hierarchy can arrange even to arrest a woman for carrying a Bible! However, the Scriptures tell us that the time would come when people would think they were doing God a favor by bringing persecution on true Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries sent into the Dominican Republic by the Society some years ago remain there, but it is impossible for them to preach the gospel in the manner they desire. At present they have taken up secular work to help them remain in their assignment. The Society still supports them and keeps them in the established missionary homes. This it will continue to do, having full faith that someday the work will be freely done and that opportunity will again be theirs to preach the Word without hindrance. Their very presence in the land, not running away, is a source of strength to the faithful followers of the Lord who have learned the truth from them. All are glad to see their courage manifest by sticking to their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch servant sent in a report of happenings during the year, and it is very interesting. Not all the details can be published here, due to lack of space, but Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere offer prayers for these brethren just as they do for all those who suffer for righteousness’ sake. From behind the Hierarchy’s iron curtain shrouding the Dominican Republic, this news trickles through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of completing last year’s report we were looking forward to our September circuit assembly in Santiago, the first in the Dominican Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After surmounting shortages, last-minute changes, hall problems, inexperienced help, and all the other factors precedent to an assembly, we gathered together Friday night, September 23, in a large vacant tobacco warehouse. Friday night’s crowd had eaten all our cafeteria food and were seated or standing for the night’s sessions. The program was a typical circuit assembly schedule and went off accordingly. The next day the brethren participated in all features of the work except handbill distribution. Problems and restrictions kept us from using handbills. Many curious came to our Saturday and Sunday sessions and swelled our attendance to 260 for our Sunday’s public lecture. Twentyeight were baptized and the brethren left their first assembly refreshed and determined to preach the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three-day assembly convinced many of the newly found country brethren that this was the organization that the Lord was using to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in this time of the end. Many of the good-will persons took added interest in our work. It continued to grow. This growth Irked the religionists. First signs of opposition were separate releases of two Catholic handbills, one saying “Down with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and the other linking us with communism. But this opposition just whetted the appetite of many righteous-minded persons and by the end of November we had 291 publishers in the field, with prospects for many more. In spite of all the problems we continued preaching regularly. Public meeting work increased especially in the country, where one pioneer gave 12 lalks one month. In that neighborhood 53 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June 21 the branch servant was called up to the office of the secretary of the interior and was handed a prepared decree banning the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Both of the newspapers of this country were on hand to record this triumph of the Hierarchy. Its representative was on hand too, for a white-robed Jesuit priest was in conference with the secretary for a half hour before the interview. The iron curtain had fallen around the truth bearers in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This decree banned all of our magazines. No deliveries were made to subscribers. Meeting together to discuss Bible truths was prohibited. Kingdom halls were closed. Even home Bible studies were prohibited. Witnesses were followed on the streets and threats made to those who listened to them. Carrying literature on the streets was against the law. Would the police enforce this decree? We soon had an answer. A few days after the ban the brethren in the hill country were called to town and questioned, seventeen in all. Seven were jailed. Their homes were searched and all literature taken from them. The jailed brethren were beaten. When the case came up in court the brethren found out they were charged with breaking the recently issued decree against the work. The pioneer was fined fifteen dollars because he was the “ringleader”, and the rest were set free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The gallantry of the Latins was forgotten and police and public officials stooped to new lows in their efforts to “get” Jehovah’s witnesses. A sister was picked up on the street by the police, questioned in an inquisitional manner for four hours, and finally, at 9 o’clock at night, put in the women’s prison. Here she suffered further indignities. At her trial in the first court no witnesses appeared against her, only the charge that she was carrying the Bible with her and propagating her faith. In the appeal court still no witnesses appeared against her, not even the arresting officer. Both courts gave her “the limit”, three months in prison and $100 fine. Even Latin courtesy had to bow to religious persecution. The situation wasn’t cleared up either when the prosecutor said it was against the law to carry a Bible on the street and talk about it, when at the same time the Dominican flag has as its slogan “God, fatherland and liberty” with the open Bible pictured in its very center 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ban of June 21 sort of quashed our hopes of going to the international assembly in New York, but still we had hopes of going. But each day the conditions and leading of the Lord seemed to indicate that it would be better for all of us to stay here and miss an 8-day assembly, sticking with the much-persecuted brethren. Getting back into the country we knew would be impossible once we left. Three of the Dominican sisters got to go and the two Gilead graduates that were here and had to leave the country were there. We got news of the assembly in the daily </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> from New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the writing of this report the ban of June 21 Is still in effect and the police are still intimidating the good-will people. Gilead missionaries and pioneers can’t get their quota of hours in the service, and at the suggestion of the Society are finding secular employment to become a working part of the community. Stepping back into the world for work is very difficult for us, but ‘sticking to our work’ is the motivating reason and we know that the Lord will bless us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers of the Kingdom in Ecuador were blessed during the year because they had full freedom to push forward with the work. Ecuador has a liberal government even though the majority of the people there are Catholic. The Ecuadorians have insisted on freedom not only for themselves but also for others, and this freedom has allowed the work of Jehovah’s witnesses to forge ahead. The missionaries who were sent to Ecuador as well as the local publishers are having many interesting experiences. They are doing some follow-up work, too, on some pioneers who traveled through Ecuador in 1935, following the Washington convention in the United States. These two sisters placed much literature, and now that this seed is being cultivated some of these people are associating with Jehovah’s witnesses and engaging in the work. The seed sown 15 years ago is now bearing fruit. The branch servant in Ecuador sent us some interesting experiences, and a few of these follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An employee of the Provincial Government of Cafiar read with much interest in the Spanish edition of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest (Selecciones)</span><span class="font4"> the article concerning the 1946 convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cleveland. He was so impressed by this that he wrote to the Society in Brooklyn for further information regarding Jehovah’s witnesses, expressing a desire to associate with such a group of fighters for truth and righteousness. The letter was forwarded to the Ecuador branch and literature was immediately mailed to this man. Later one of the missionaries spending his vacation not far distant from the place visited this man and his family. His residence is in Azogues, situated in the center of the most fanatical stronghold of Catholicism in Ecuador. A Bible, several books and booklets and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription were placed with this party and he and his family were shown how to study the books with the Bible. He had never had a Bible in his hands before. We hope to be able to make a back-call on this “sheep” shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One elderly gentlemen, formerly connected with the Evangelical church here, came whole-heartedly into the truth and began witnessing to any and all, including his former church associates. He felt obligated to go back one last time to the church to testify on their testimonial night. He took advantage of this occasion to declare himself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and to charge all the members of the church with the responsibility of also taking and declaring the name “Jehovah” to the people, forcefully “calling” them for not having used the name heretofore when their Bible is so filled with the name. (The Spanish Protestant Bibles, both the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Valera</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moderna,</span><span class="font4"> use the name the original 6,823 times.) He also showed why they should visit the people in their homes and study the Bible with them as do Jehovah’s witnesses. The minister of the church forbade him to testify thus in their church again. Shortly thereafter this brother became an engineer on a local ship which plies the coast of many of the out-of-the-way towns of Ecuador, and he immediately began preaching the Word to crew and townfolk alike, reporting much time and many studies in this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several months ago a lady was contacted in her bazaar and the publisher noted upon one of the shelves a copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moderna</span><span class="font4"> Bible. Complimenting her upon this, imagine the publisher’s surprise and delight with the lady’s rejoinder: “Yes, indeed, and I read it every day; but I have no one to teach it to me.” No time was wasted in placing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and starting the study. From then on this bazaar has been a busy Kingdom center in every way. Not only is every lesson well-prepared and marked, with Bible texts also marked, but the office girls were carefully and constantly witnessed to by their mistress. One Is now too a witness for Jehovah. When opportune the customers receive the witness. The husband, who at first believed his wife to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">loca,</span><span class="font4"> and refused to sit in on the studies, nevertheless “listened” from the kitchen, is now a lively and enthusiastic publisher, and one may not pass the store without seeing some piece of theocratic literature in the hand of some one of them, or may note a conversation going on regarding the truth. When recently confined to the hospital for a week the sister witnessed to her nurses and the doctor and the visitors “in season and out” ; likewise her husband. He had only recently read the 23d chapter of Matthew, and every listening ear heard the 23d chapter of Matthew one day. They have a nice frontal display of the Kingdom literature in their bazaar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A person of good will came to the missionary home and asked to study. He showed genuine interest. The third week he returned with a friend who also wished to make arrangements to study. He brought more of his friends. This resulted in five new studies for the pioneer. This person of good will is now a regular publisher. Through him a university graduate with a B. A. degree has come to a knowledge of the truth. He marvels at the grand truths, saying they are priceless in comparison with the knowledge gained in the universities. He expresses the desire to be a pioneer, and has offered his services free of charge to help the new missionaries with an understanding of the Spanish language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A shoemaker’s daughter, unable to prove her Catholic beliefs, arranged for two Gilead graduates and another party of good will to call with her on a Jesuit priest of a large Catholic church in Quito. After two hours’ Scriptural argumentation on the part of the missionaries, wherein eternal torment, purgatory, immortality of the soul, etc., were proved false, he was completely devoid of any scriptures to refute or present in behalf of his church. His only argument was that the church doctrine was sufficient, and he refused to use the Bible. He stated emphatically that he didn’t need the Bible, that the church was the final authority. He shook with nervousness, and was “dumb” and speechless when the young shoemaker’s daughter asked him if he wouldn’t explain the scriptures submitted. The lady of good will accompanying us asked him: “Now, won’t you tell this young lady the truth?” But, of course, he never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the door-to-door work a pioneer and a new company publisher recently contacted a school for priests. Beginning the witness with one young priest, shortly eight were listening, trying to refute statements in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and the Bible. One tried in vain to find a text in the Bible to support the immortality doctrine, making for his excuse that this was a Protestant Bible. None could use the Bible to support their traditions. They said that they had no t raining in the use of the Scriptures; they were given the correct answers to all their questions by the elder priests and the “infallible papa”. To their emphatic statement that the church had its visible head on the eartli they were asked if the church were recognized as a visible or an invisible body. “Invisible,” they said. Then, “why a visible head?” A bell rang inside and they had to go. The door was shut and the pioneer and companion left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Scarcely had they gone half a block when a voice hailed them back. A young priest who had overheard the entire conversation wished to know more. Result: He took a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and booklets, and requested the brethren to return the next week. When the revisit was made it was very difficult to gain admittance again, but finally after a wait of about twenty minutes the young priest appeared, and, although apparently very nervous, seemed greatly comforted by the message; had read some of the book, but had hidden it so that it would not be taken from him. He stated that the archbishop of Quito had issued a decree that made it a mortal sin for any Catholic layman or priest to read any of this literature. However, arrangements were made to keep in contact with this good-will priest, who seemed to really appreciate the value of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eleven from Ecuador were privileged to attend the convention in New York, to receive the marvelous blessings Jehovah had in store for his people there. Of these eleven two were Ecuadorian publishers who went along with the missionaries to attend a convention of Jehovah’s people for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has especially manifested his blessing upon the activity of the missionaries in taking an interest individually in the new and weak and irregular company publishers. They have taken them into the field service regularly and worked with them on their back-calls and in the door-to-door service. This has contributed largely to the great increase in the work here in Ecuador.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The religious organizations of Egypt are not at all anxious for their people to hear the truth concerning God’s kingdom. The Coptic and Greek Orthodox churches have put all the obstacles they could in the way of the preaching of the message. Despite this the people do want to hear what the Bible has to say. There has been a splendid increase in the work in Egypt during the year. They have had six peaks during the year, reaching a high of 221 publishers, to compare with last year’s peak of 167. Due to poor economic conditions within Egypt a number of brethren had to leave for other countries to find work. Some went to Libya and others to Sudan, but wherever they are these brethren have continued to preach the gospel and have sent reports to the branch office in Cairo. The branch servant there set out some of these interesting experiences from the three countries, Egypt, Libya and Sudan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers here had to use in the work the Arabic </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> instead of books or booklets, as we have just a few of these in stock and which we were able to receive by post. The few </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let (Jod Be True”</span><span class="font4"> books we have are used to feed the sheep through home Bible studies. But the supply of Arabic and French publications is kept now for more than two years in the Censorship of the Ministry of Interior. Although our fight to get these publications has not resulted in their release so far, it has caused a great witness to all those working in the Censorship as well as many high officials of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the last few months a group of publishers has been going once a week to a village located about 15 miles away from Cairo. Aftei’ going in the door-to-door work, they found good-will interest and established home Bible studies. It seems that some religious Coptics were pursuing the publishers in their work and as they were discussing in one of the homes one of them knocked at the door and asked if Jehovah’s witnesses were there. He wanted to argue, and so the brethren, after finishing the discussion, went to his place and found there a group ready for arguments. So doctrines were discussed, especially the trinity, and finally the publishers were told to stop coming in the village and ‘doing this evil work’. A few days later a leaflet was printed against us and addressed “To the Noble Coptic People”. The last sentence of this leaflet said: “So do not err from the right faith and do not read their books and close your doors in their faces so that you may have the grace of our Lord and God and Redeemer Jesus Christ to whom be the permanent glory in his church from now and forever. Amen!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren naturally took no notice of this and went the following week as usual. The people were astonished and many expressed their wonder. One of them said to a brother: “You are still coming here! Have you not read the leaflet? They are going to beat you.” But no matter what they think of us or plan to do, the work is being done and persons of good will are being gathered. And now some persons from that village are publishing. Not only there, but in Cairo also and Alexandria special Increases have been noted among the Coptics and Syrians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the Coptic Hierarchy is enraged against the witnesses, the Greek Orthodox Church is not sleeping. One of her spokesmen writing every Saturday against us said in one of his articles that it is good to refuse our publications when presented at the doors, but it is better to buy them, not to read them but to give them to him and so one day he will take all the publications given him by good orthodox church members and have a feast of rejoicing in burning them all outside the church. This reminds us of the Dark Ages, when thousands of Bibles and books were burned In public. But the articles he publishes are a kind of advertisement for us and rather than doing harm they are opening the eyes of many Greek lovers of righteousness who see the falseness of his sayings and come to us inquiring about the truth, as many of his articles are dealing with hypnotism and soul phenomena. The result is that some members of his organization have left him and are regularly attending our meetings. They are now publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All this work of preaching has been done in lower Egypt and all the 221 publishers constituting the highest peak this year are in just a few towns and villages of lower Egypt. There are many “sheep” yet to be found in this part of Egypt but many more in upper Egypt, where there is not even one publisher. The Egyptian field is in need of workers, yes, pioneers, and we pray Jehovah to send us some Gilead graduates to help In feeding the Lord’s “other sheep”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>LIBYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Libya started a few months ago when a brother from Egypt went with his wife to Tripoli, Libya, for his secular work. Some preaching was done by him when another brother who was a company servant in Egypt left also for Tripoli. As soon as he arrived the interests of the Theocracy were discussed, and so a small company was organized and meetings arranged. Then for the first time this brother went from shop to shop in Tripoli and it appeared that many sheep were lost and hungry and had to be found and fed. Yes, and to prove this, two Bible studies were arranged that day. And as the days passed, more and more praise was given to Jehovah, resulting in many persons’ taking their stand with the great Theocrat and his kingdom. There are approximately twenty persons attending the meetings now in Tripoli, and in July a peak of five publishers was reached, including a vacation pioneer. The few brethren there did a good work In seven months’ time, placing 265 books, booklets and magazines and making a total of 274 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An interesting experience occurred in the village of Zavia, which is 28 miles away from Tripoli. A brother went there for a day to spread the Kingdom news, and here again good-will persons were found. They were glad to hear about Jehovah’s provision for the new world, as they had never heard anything about it before. And so by going from door to door the lovers of righteousness were satisfied and 23 books, booklets and copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> were placed In just a few hours. The priest of the village soon knew about it and warned the people in his church, requesting them to burn the publications they had taken. The result was that those persons who did not know about the visit of the brother wanted to learn more and went to the place where he had passed the night, asking for publications. Now all the village Is talking about this visitor and his publications and some have taken their stand with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus in spite of the efforts of the religionists to keep the people in darkness, the other sheep are hearing the voice of the Good Shepherd and following him on the way to life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">About two months before the end of the 1950 service year, a brother left Cairo and went to Sudan for his secular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soon after his arrival in Khartoum, Sudan, he reached persons of good will who W’ere ready to learn about God’s purposes as contained in his written Word. As he is free only in the evenings he cannot start Bible studies at present, because if they put on the light the house will be filled with mosquitoes in a few minutes, for the mosquitoes are common in this time of year. Nevertheless the brother always finds the time to talk about Jehovah’s new world of righteousness and so he was able to devote 155 hours in Kingdom service during the two months of July and August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More publishers will be leaving Egypt soon for Sudan and this, of course, will increase the activities of the Theocracy in this new territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year the people of El Salvador have partaken freely of Jehovah’s provisions to the fine end that the organization in that land has grown in size. It is a joy to banquet at the spiritual table of Jehovah, and the witnesses in El Salvador appreciate the feast of fat things. When the missionaries who have been serving so well in El Salvador left for the New York assembly, they were a little fearful of what might happen to the new publishers and the organization that remained behind. But on re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">turning following the assembly they discovered that the companies had continued splendidly. The folks were able to handle prosperous public meeting series; all of the company publishers dug in and worked hard in making the back-calls and caring for the Bible studies. They just kept the service going like veterans. When the missionaries who had watched the work grow from infancy returned, they could have asked for no greater reward for their efforts than to see the publishers standing on their own feet for Jehovah and preaching the good news as independent publishers. That is a wonderful reward for missionaries to find on returning from Theocracy’s Increase Assembly, and it certainly made glad their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch servant in El Salvador gives us some very interesting happenings in that land from the past year’s service, and we briefly record a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">December brought our first outstanding joy: four new graduates arrived to undertake their ministry in this warm country of mountains and fine coffee. Then with hardly a “breather” in between, we were all out at the airport to meet Brother Robert Morgan, who served us most wonderfully for four days visiting our missionary homes and by high-pointing his stay with an excellent talk, “Liberty to the Captives,” given to an audience of 803 persons who were utterly amazed to find that something completely free for all people was actually offered in their finest and most reputable theater. All listeners manifested complete approval of the strong points of the talk; they were deeply impressed, favorably, and people are still talking about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Morgan left, but one week later our joys were to hit a new peak, for, closely following his footsteps in the sands of time, came you yourself, Brother Knorr, bringing with you your own good counsel and the many important decisions which you made in regard to our service in the field, which meant for us: the opening of our third missionary home, in San Miguel; another company new to the country; more frequent visits to the companies and isolated publishers by the circuit servant; and the two new Gilead graduates who arrived after the great international convention in New York. Your being here meant a lot to the missionaries, who were hungry for direct word from headquarters; but it meant still more to the company publishers whose hearts you easily won and who now have a more definite understanding of the work world-wide and of their part in it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our public meetings increased 50 per cent over 1949, with some very interesting results, like the talks that were given in a hospital. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hospital Rosales</span><span class="font4"> is the general hospital for San Salvador, and among the numerous convalescents quartered there one of our back-calls found himself as the result of an accident. He talked the truth to everyone he met, and it was not long before lie heard rumors of someone else who was preaching as a witness for Jehovah in the tuberculosis ward. So, of course, when the missionary called to see how he was doing, she was told to see this man in the isolated ward to check the rumor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She went to the tuberculosis ward only to find the rumor to be very wild, for instead of one person of good will she found at least </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">six</span><span class="font4"> of them, and they were all on fire with zeal to become Jehovah’s witnesses. They passed their time in convalescence poring over the Society’s publications, and they were indescribably overjoyed to see one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the course of time talks were given right in the hospital to audiences of up to fifty. The six, who were further advanced than the others and who were outstanding in their zeal to be publishers, actually started to publish in their hospital ward, conducting studies among the almost 200 inmates housed there. They wanted to learn to make out reports and all there was to know about the working of the company organization. But learning this only served to whet their appetite for more and increased their yearning to associate with the brethren on the outside. To date, two have been discharged as cured, and, needless to say, they came out preaching and made their first stop the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our next experience is unusual because it has to do with one of the first studies established in El Salvador when the work was first opened. At least ten different missionaries have conducted studies in the home of this family during a period of more than five years with discouraging results. The family was of good will, but there was no effort made to attend meetings and certainly no interest in service; it was what we called “a dead study”. Now, however, in the last few months the entire family publishes and attends meetings, and this is how it came about: Finally, after so many studies over so many years, who do you guess was the first to take a stand toward a positive active part in company activities? The man? The wife? The children? You’re all wrong! It was the little Indian cook who after having listened in on all of those Bible lessons decided to do something about it. And now since she has been going in the service, attending meetings, etc., so have the children, so has the father and so has the mother. The heartening end is that now every Sunday they may all be seen at the meetings—the father, the mother, the little girls, and the cook—all publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago when the president of the Society visited Finland he suggested that a goal be set of 4,000 publishers. Thus there would be at least one publisher for every thousand people in the land. At that time, three years ago, the brethren in Finland had reached a peak of 2,534. Now the Finnish organization of Jehovah’s witnesses has 4,354 publishers in the country, and, by the Lord’s grace, they are not stopping there in their search for the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font5">Finland is a hard country in which to work, .but the people are steady and determined. When one receives the truth, he does not leave a stone unturned in bringing it to others in his locality. A good witness was given during the year to members of Parliament and various officials concerning the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses for the Kingdom and their position of neutrality with respect to worldly affairs. Being ministers and servants of the Most High, they put these matters first in their lives. There are a number of the officials in the Finnish government who appreciate the stand Jehovah’s witnesses have taken and admire them for their faithfulness to their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Finnish branch office keeps the witnesses in that land supplied with literature. There is a printing plant in connection with the Bethel home, and during the year 2,669,278 pieces of literature -were printed. This included bound books, booklets, copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and advertising leaflets. Excerpts from the report of the branch servant are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A large percentage of our companies are within the thinly populated rural area and sometimes brethren have long distances to travel to attend meetings. However, not unusual Is the circuit servant’s report on a company of two publishers which showed an attendance of 47 at the public talk. During the vacation the branch servant, a Gilead graduate who has been speaking Finnish only six months, gave a public meeting only six miles from the Russian border. One hour before the meeting only a few persons had assembled in the large room of a farmhouse. The brethren had advertised only by word of mouth. Soon the hillside was alive with people coming from all directions on foot, bicycle, horse cart, etc. When the time came for the talk we joyfully saw over 100 persons assembled to hear the public talk “Who Is Your God?” These humble, meek country people love the truth and come great distances to hear it. Last year this small rural company grew from a peak of 30 publishers to 50. In one section of their territory every house has Jehovah’s witnesses. One publisher remarked, ‘There are so many witnesses that the ones that are not Jehovah’s witnesses are ashamed of themselves.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the long, hard winters here, when summer comes all people are out of doors. We have used this knowledge to push the public meeting campaign. One city of 100,000 population and in which there are two units had 80 outdoor public meetings in one month, with excellent results. In Helsinki we used six different parks regularly each week. One such park stands directly alongside one of Helsinki’s largest churches. Great is the contrast when the truth about religion rings forth from our loud-speakers and resounds and echoes from the rafters into the empty church. One cannot help but notice the dead, cold look of the gray church on the hill but the life, vitality, activity and warmth of the public meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses in the park below. Every week during the summer this took place much to the chagrin of the priests who tried to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from using the park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bible studies have played an important role in expansion. In one scattered village three years ago only one family showed interest. Because of the emphasis on Bible studies this little company has grown to nine publishers and joyfully reports 18 home Bible studies. They say many more studies could be started if only they had a few more to take care of them. Recently a brother from the branch office gave a public talk there with 65 persons present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The news of the International convention in New York was received with rejoicing and many made plans to go. So many difficulties arose that only a few were able to go. But those who did go returned home joyous and enthusiastic and wanting to give out to others the same spiritual food that they received. The brethren are all keenly awaitIng news of the convention which will be given them at our district assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This land lying as far in the northland as Alaska, and some parts within the Arctic circle, is showing good progress in the Kingdom work. Most of the people are poor, and have to work long, hard hours for the necessities of life, yet do not let these conditions prevent their Kingdom activity. In some parts of the land large distances must be met in order to take part in the service. For example, one circuit servant reports that in one company the nearest neighbor is six miles away and the nearest interested person is nine miles. This is a long distance considering the fact that they must walk. So these brethren cannot take an hour or so off and expect to witness. They must take whole days or spend several hours each time they want to go into the field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in France have every reason to rejoice, because the Lord’s blessing has been richly upon them. There was a 40 per cent increase in the number of publishers preaching the Word. A number of factors contributed to this, including the circuit work and circuit assemblies. Through these the publishers became better equipped for the various features of the work, the house-to-house activity, magazine street work and the back-call and Bible-study activity. The country is now divided into ten circuits and two districts, and the French brethren appreciate this organizational arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers know the value of entering the pioneer service. There was an average of 142 pioneers, and many of these started new companies. In some cases when they first entered territories there were only two or three publishers, but now these have been increased to 30, 40 and even 50 witnesses for the new world. It appears the French people are seeking for truth and righteousness. They have been harassed long with war and their trials have been great, so the truth now comes as a great comfort to them. Undoubtedly all of these publishers will press on with Theocracy’s increase during 1951. The branch servant sent us some interesting items, which are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One company which has made a particular effort to put into practice the counsel and suggestions received has risen in the past year from 102 to 214 publishers and has been divided into two units. Another company which a year ago had 10 publishers now has 40. Yet another company saw its number of publishers grow from 33 to 82 in one year. The companies of Greater Paris have Increased in number of publishers from 450 to 650 during the past year. All this is convincing proof that now the Lord is also calling out his “other sheep” in France and gathering them into his sheepfold. One parish priest who wished to hinder this ingathering work by playing on the superstitious minds of the people preached that Jehovah’s witnesses were under the control of the evil spirits which were seen to glide about at night around the Kingdom Hall. But when the police got busy and arrested these supposed “evil spirits” they found underneath the white ghosty cloaks none other than the parish priest and some of his “faithful”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers are recognizing more and more that the basis for increase rests first and foremost on the house-to-house work, followed through by good back-calling leading to home Bible studies. This Increased appreciation has resulted in the number of back-calls this year jumping up from 142,075 to 244,584, and home Bible studies from 1,441 to 2,295. A larger share In these Important features of Kingdom service has meant an Increased crop of joyful experiences, one of which tells of a lady who took the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and showed it to her priest, who advised her to burn It Immediately. Curious, the lady read the book, and told the publisher making the return visit, &quot;I didn’t burn it because I have just visited Rome for the holy year, and what I saw there has opened my eyes! Now I want to study this book. Come round this evening when my husband is here.” That evening five persons were present for the study, asking many questions, and expressing satisfaction at the Scriptural answers given. They received three subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and, in addition, one book and sixteen booklets were placed. The following week seven persons attended the study. That </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> book, instead of being burned, has begun to burn up the priest’s religious pastures; and as for the so-called &quot;holy year” —well, it seems to have misfired, at least as far as this honest Catholic lady is concerned!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the 1950 service year we were still able only to distribute the magazines </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> by means of subscriptions, so efforts were made to receive authorization from the government to distribute the magazines on the streets. These efforts were crowned with success, and now </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font4"> appear on the streets, and with good results too. One brother reports that within half an hour his stock of magazines was exhausted, and a talk with a gentleman resulted in the placement of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and the arranging of a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of the year we have had only slight opposition to overcome. The only enemies that showed themselves were the religionists who tried to stir up the police against us. But in general it has been found that the police and the officials In the prefectures were more kindly disposed toward the truth than toward our accusers and they saw the hypocrisy of these religionists. They saw that our work was honest before God and men. These officials have received hours of good witnessing each time an Inquiry was made, and often have wished the publishers success in their work and have promised to attend our public meetings themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">pioneer relates the following: “When our religious accusers saw that they could not turn the officials at the commissariat of police against our work, they went to the prefecture. I was forthwith summoned to the prefecture to answer the complaint made against us that we were molesting people and creating religious discord in the town. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">was able to show the police inspector why it was that the religionists were against us, and after referring to the legal basis for our work I was able to give him a good witness. After an hour and a half he dismissed me, wishing me much joy in my work and good success.” In another town a pioneer was questioned for an hour and three quarters by the chief inspector of the security police. In the end the official said, “Your work is worthy of admiration and I’ll certainly have to go to one of your public meetings.” He Intimated that it was the clergy who had accused us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Behind us we have really a joyful year full of abundant blessings, of which the brilliant conclusion was the great International assembly at New York with all that we saw, heard and learned. The effect of these things will benefit the new year, which should bring even more increase, for Jehovah is the One who is leading his people forward by his power and strength. So we look forward with confidence to the new year which has just begun and we rejoice at all the good things which our kind God has prepared for us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Excellent progress was made in this territory which comes under the Paris branch office. The theocratic ministry school has played a big part in preparing the brethren to speak at public meetings, and the public meetings, in turn, have played an excellent part in aiding the people of good will to take their stand for the Kingdom. Considerable opposition has been demonstrated by the clergy, but undoubtedly Jehovah only laughs at their efforts to retard the work, for he has them in derision. Nothing can stop Christ Jesus, the reigning King appointed by Jehovah God, from gathering his “other sheep”, and he is using his people in the earth to take care of the assembling work. Some experiences of interest have occurred in the Saar, and they are recorded by the branch servant at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase in the companies lias been mainly the result of increased back-calling and more home Bible studies. Back-calls have increased from 30,601 to 42,836, and home Bible studies from 141 to 259. Publishers are appreciating more and more how vital these features of service are in helping people of good will. It is by this means that new “sheep” are fed and strengthened until they are strong enough to attend the meetings of God’s people themselves without fearing the derisive looks of their neighbors, or the curse of their erstwhile spiritual shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This does not suit the clergy at all, seeing the sheep flee from them and consecrating their time and their substance to the service of the true God. So by means of lies and slander they seek to put Jehovah’s witnesses in a bad light. They preach against them in the pulpits and write derogatory articles about them in their parish magazines. They stir up school children and parents against them so that when the witnesses arrive in a village to preach about God’s kingdom the people throw stones at them. And if a person of good will does renounce his association with the church in order to serve the true God, then his name, date of birth and family tree are read out publicly from the pulpit and he is denounced as a false prophet, the entire village being warned that he has sided with Jehovah’s witnesses. A system of spying has been set up whereby the Catholic teachers in the schools show the children the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses, telling them to go home and see if any such books are in the house, and if so to bring them to school to be burned as heretical books. But just as the Hierarchy’s religious system is old and rotten, so are the methods she uses to fight the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to advance with zeal in this little country and to rejoice in the blessings and the increase which their great God Jehovah will give them during the new service year, even as he blessed them during the year which has just ended.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The cruel hand of communistic rule has clutched Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. Throughout the year a wonderful witness was given to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name, and the people of Eastern and Western Germany were informed concerning the kingdom of God as the only hope for the world. The communistic government, however, does not appreciate the good news and comfort that is contained in the Bible. From their standpoint, anything not for communism must be destroyed. Until the communistic government had firmly implanted their doctrines into the minds of the East Germans, they did not disturb Jehovah’s witnesses; but, now that they feel they have full control of that territory, they are trying to wipe out the witnesses through property seizure and through incarceration or sending the principal brethren off to concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports are to hand that conditions in Eastern Germany even surpass in cruelty the Nazi regime. Christians throughout the world will offer prayers to the Lord on behalf of their distressed brethren behind this iron curtain, including those in Poland and Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany and the other communist-dominated countries to the east. These witnesses of Jehovah have done nothing wrong unless it be preaching God’s kingdom as the only hope for the world. If that is wrong in the eyes of the world and in the minds of the world rulers, then they will have to take the consequences when God declares his judgments against the world. For God has decreed that his witnesses upon the earth shall cry out this message, and this they will continue to do even unto death. The branch servant, who directs the work out of the Wiesbaden office, sent a very moving report, and portions of it are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately after returning from the richly blessed convention, we came into exciting days. In the early morning of August 30, in the same hour that we joyfully arrived at the Wiesbaden Bethel, strong communistic police forces led by two Russian officers forced their way into our Magdeburg Bethel, arresting all brothers and sisters of the family and seizing the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s property. As we told them in Berlin right to their faces one year ago, they seek to take up where the Nazis left off, attempting to extinguish the true worship of Jehovah in this country by increased brutality and cruelty, by fear and horror. Let us go some time back to explain this development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year of 1950 has in this country been marked by steady but irresistible Increase of the number of publishers in the service for the King and the Kingdom. With only one exception, each of the twelve months of the year saw a new peak of publishers, new worshipers of the Most High entering the ranks of his witnesses to be taught and to “preach the word” together with them. This strong and regular increase could not be stopped or hindered, not even in the Eastern zone of this country suppressed by Russians and communists. This is revealed by the fact that in July the Eastern zone comprising about one-third of the German territory reported about 23,(XX) publishers, whereas Western Germany with a territory twice as big showed about 30,000 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning street witnessing which is carried out In Western Germany and Berlin and only with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">the brethren have been blazing the trail through all hindrances. In some towns where their activity was objected to, favorable court decisions were obtained confirming their right to this freedom of worship. Some stubborn resistance against our activity In the streets may be overcome by cases coming up for trial shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also in Berlin street witnessing with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">is carried out. The activity of our brethren there was thrown into the spotlight as a female reporter interviewed a 15-year-old street publisher on the Kurfiirstendamm, one of the main avenues of Berlin. Among her impressions she wrote the following in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tagesspiegel (Daily Mirror) : </span><span class="font4">&quot;Impossible to put off with a joke this serious zealous boy who spoke modestly but earnestly. He is one of Jehovah's witnesses, and ‘it is written’. His school fellows . . . laughed at him, but he does not forsake his duty to talk to them as to all other people for whom he feels sorry I” The reporter closes her report, saying: “He shakes hands with me. And then I see him for a moment standing calm and quiet in the whirl of people passing by; a small boy dressed in a blue skiing suit among women with poodles and men with brief cases, people going to the barber or the movies or to work. As I realize from his ardent up-turned face that he has again addressed somebody as he did me, it seems as if he is the only one in the whole street who stands still.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But our German brethren in the East did not fall short in zeal and devotion of the publishers in Western Germany who could carry out their service on the broadest scale. Also they went from house to house, made back-calls and had home Bible studies and placed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> books and booklets with persons of good will despite many difficulties and steadily increasing interferences by communistic police. They still held their company meetings even if they could scarcely protect themselves against numerous spies in their Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the rapid increase of our companies the communists became more and more aggressive. They began to disturb the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, to break up circuit assemblies, and answered our protesting brethren with police clubs. By the fearless attitude and the steadfastness shown by the brethren in spite of this terror they gained more and more the respect and sympathy of the population which is sighing under the communistic suppression. Oue day a brother lured into a GPU trap disappeared from Bethel at Magdeburg. Because of the untenableness of these conditions and because further plans and purposes against us became known, we submitted a protest, a petition, which found its answer in the night raid on our property in Magdeburg and the confiscation of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The spirit and the mendacious tactics of the rulers in the East become very clear through a letter from the Ministry of Home Department addressed to the Watch Tower, Magdeburg, in which we were notified of the ban. This letter written to our office was dated August 31, after all the brethren had been arrested on August 30, the preceding day. In this letter the Watch Tower Society is accused of espionage in favor of America. Another letter is being circulated by the police. On this all Jehovah’s witnesses are to certify by signature that the Watch Tower Society really had to do with espionage. He who does not sign this paper Is arrested without consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A hard time has begun for our brethren In the East. Almost all company servants are already arrested and many other brethren also. Almost everybody loses his Job these days and thereby the daily bread. Daily groups of brethren arrived In Berlin. Some want to be counseled and then return to the Zone; others have fled when the communists broke into their homes, and left all their property behind them, everything they possess. They prefer to lose all they had in order to maintain their freedom and to continue serving the Lord. Pioneers inform us that despite all persecutions they will keep endeavoring to meet their quota; company publishers proceed with back-calls and home Bible studies. In a factory in which the dismissal of one of Jehovah’s witnesses was demanded by two communistic functionaries, the outcome of the vote was 98 per cent in favor of the stay of this brother. When these two functionaries enraged because of their failure got into a sharp argument with their fellow workers somebody demanded that a vote be taken on the dismissal of the two functionaries, which would certainly have a different outcome. A 70-year-old pioneer who has an artificial leg and who besides his service nurses his entirely paralyzed wife, a sister, was arrested. As they went away with the old man they shouted to this bed-bound sister, “You see how you get along alone!” As the police came to arrest one brother, he received them in the striped zebra clothing he wore in the Nazi concentration camp, saying, “Well, I’m all set for a ‘democratic’ concentration camp!” Terrified and enraged by so much boldness, these officers left him standing in his costume and went off without him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all Eastern German newspapers articles containing immense slander, lies and meanness of incomprehensible kind appear daily on the front pages with big headlines. Jehovah’s witnesses are accused of every crime. The notable thing herein is that the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) press of the Eastern zone has fully yoked in and publishes this filthiness either before or after the SED (communist party) lias done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The newspapers and radio of Western Germany express their indignation concerning these new persecutions of Christians and report of arrests of hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses up to now. A protest note to the communistic government of Eastern Germany and a letter to the Allied High Commission was sent off. Confidently and full of expectation we lay this matter into the hands of Jehovah and his King, who will take care of it, and we are sure that if it pleases the Lord he will use his power anew in our behalf, as already once in modern times, and will vindicate his name by his people of his own possession, for ‘all his enemies will be made his footstool’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Looking back over the joyful months of ceaseless proclamation of the new world message, our hearts are made glad because of the increase. The Theocracy is increasing in Gold Coast as elsewhere. Jehovah’s witnesses in Gold Coast have diligently cared for the back-call and Bible-study work and excellent increases are found in the annual report. Evidently this is one of the reasons why there was a 50 per cent increase in the number of publishers preaching the Word. There is opposition from the clergy, and the brethren are not allowed to bring all the publications they desire into the country, due to governmental fear and restrictions. Here also the charge of communism has been leveled against them as it has been against Jehovah’s witnesses in many parts of the world. But despite all of these difficulties the work is progressing, and the report of the branch servant shows us what has been accomplished. Under the direction of the Gold Coast branch comes the service in Ivory Coast, where the work is just beginning. Now there is one publisher there, and he has found good interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theocratic ministry school has greatly helped the brothers to become more capable at delivering public talks. The result: In 1947 there were 273 public meetings held, the following year 752, last year 1,078, and this year 2,211 ! We have worked for the Increase, anticipated the increase, and Jehovah has certainly given the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following public meeting experience was reported by a graduate of Gilead. “At 7:30 a.m. a group witnessing party set out to walk along a dry, dusty path to the village of Ankaful, a distance of some two miles. Arriving, two members of the party, myself and an interpreter, went to see the chief. After briefly outlining our work, a public talk was arranged for later that day, with the chief beating the gong-gong to inform all his subjects. Greetings and advertising arrangements completed, the party continued to the next villages of Kuntu and Nhil, following the same arrangement for witnessing as in Ankaful. At Nhli the first public talk was given with 69 in attendance. Then back over the sun-parched path to the villages previously visited. All were ready for us, resulting in three public talks to over 200 people that day. Indeed a good witness. Our little band of Kingdom publishers had walked that day a total of 15 miles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We rejoice at being able to report the expansion of the Kingdom interests into Tamale, the capital of the Northern Territories. One pioneer has been working there since May and already this brother reports that ten persons of good will are attending the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study that has been organized and most of these good-will persons have started preaching the Word with him at week ends. Over the four months this pioneer has made 166 back-calls and conducted an average of 17 home Bible studies per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How to stop this increase is the perplexing problem of those who oppose God’s new world. Several pamphlets against us are published by the religious missions, which, of course, helps to bring us to the attention of the people more and more. Anxious to grasp hold of anything to use against Jehovah’s witnesses the religious leaders cry out, ‘Communists!’ But this deliberate lie on their part falls on many a deaf ear. In a recent editorial </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Spectator Daily</span><span class="font4"> stated: “Jehovah’s Witnesses have been dubbed with communism only because of their forthright criticism of the wrong. . . . they are hated by those who fear the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The supply of vernacular literature through Brooklyn and the Nigeria braneh has been very much appreciated. This has enabled many to read for the first time the truth that can make them free. The fact that two of the native brethren are attending the 16th class of Gilead has brought much joy to the brethren. Monetary contributions have been low, but a number of brethren have sent in eatables to the missionary home at Accra.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Just one native pioneer is located In Abidjan, the capital. All efforts to gain admission for a graduate of Gilead have so far failed. The pioneer reports that many are “thirsty for the truth”. He has been in the country only three months, but his record bespeaks progress, for in August he made 60 back-calls and conducted 12 home Bible studies. We pray that the efforts of this pioneer will be richly blessed with the fruitage of others joining him in proclaiming the everlasting new world of Theocratic rule, justice, peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Greece are very grateful to the Lord for the manifold deeds of protection and blessing that he has bestowed upon them during the past service year. Conditions in Greece are a little better now as far as preaching the gospel is concerned, but there is still much persecution, the brethren are unable to assemble together in public meetings, and the Greek Orthodox church continues its opposition to any recognition for the ministers of the Lord. The difficulties faced by the brethren have been taken to the highest authorities in the land, and, although the discussions have resulted in promises to alleviate the situation, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to be a persecuted group. Notwithstanding all the difficulties, there was a 16 per cent increase in the number of publishers and the work is surging ahead. The branch servant at Athens tells us the following in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lifting of the martial law and of all emergency measures imposed on account of the bandit activities of anarchist elements has contributed much to letting God's people proceed with greater coherence and activeness to the work of preaching this Kingdom gospel. The ground was suitable for sowing the word of truth. The various persecutions, exile, imprisonments, and even murders of Christian witnesses of Jehovah contributed much to this also. By the usual methods of working, we would require many years to become known throughout the country. But now, with the intense persecution instigated by certain religious circles who are exploiting the circumstances created by the rebellion of godless communists, there Is practically no one in Greece who has not known or heard something about Jehovah’s witnesses. So the result of the malicious persecution carried out by the Devil and his agents against the ministers of the gospel has been altogether contrary to the object it was aimed at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In their efforts to expand true worship, Jehovah’s witnesses were feeling the loving assistance of the Lord’s organization in every step. The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization for Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font4"> translated into Greek, was in the hands of all Kingdom publishers since the very beginning of the service year. Thereafter, and following your approval, we issued In signatures the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> We were printing two signatures per month, which were sent to the brethren in the various companies, till the whole book was completed. The brethren’s joy for this gracious provision of the Lord is really unspeakable. On receipt of the first signatures, they immediately arranged for book studies in their companies on the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> They also supplied their goodwill people with signatures of the book, taking care to provide them subsequently with the next copies of signatures to complete the whole book. In this way, many home Bible studies were arranged for, and quite a number of good-will people are now systematically aided in learning that God is true. Since May 1950, the issue of the book in signatures has been completed. In spite of the poor means we can afford, we got it bound with a simple but strong and nice cover, and are now having it available in field service. For the first time after several years, publishers in Greece can offer a bound book in the field; the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;! </span><span class="font4">We hope that, as everywhere else, so in our country too, this book will greatly help expand Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a recent call of ours on the president of the Greek Cabinet, we made it known to him that contrary to the government’s orders not to mistreat citizens in the district of his native place, agents of public order violently arrested Jehovah’s witnesses, seized their individual Bibles and literature of their faith, mistreated them very cruelly, and then baptized by force a 17-year-old Jehovah's witness, Timothy by name, born and reared in the truth by parents who are Jehovah’s witnesses and gave him the name of “Demetrius”. The president of the government expressed his surprise at this, and suggested for a complaint to be lodged against these agents of publie order. We further Informed him that for over a year ten witnesses of Jehovah have been detained In Makronesus Island for reason of religious conscience. He gave a written order for them to be immediately released. Yet this written order of the government’s president was never executed I So these ten family men and chaste Christians are still In exile away from their children and families, without having committed any punishable action and without having violated any of the country’s laws. We feel, however, fully confident that the endurance and integrity of these brethren will finally be greatly rewarded, and will result in the glory of Jehovah God’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year we had the excellent blessing to move our offices from the narrow space in the basement of Tenedos street up to the second floor of the same building. This removal of ours necessitated an expenditure of several million drachmas. We feel grateful to the Lord’s organization for approving the expense, and also for its loving interest in improving the conditions which the Bethel staff is working in. On May 21, 1950, we held a fine meeting at which we inaugurated the nice and spacious apartment placed by the Lord at our disposal. We are determined to utilize all of these arrangements for rendering still more honor and glory to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I also wish to report with particular satisfaction the fact that following your approval one brother and one sister from Greece will enter the IGtli class of Gilead School, commencing September, 1950. We look to having other brethren too enjoy this excellent privilege in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Theocracy’s Increase Assembly, which took place in Yankee Stadium. New York, this year, has been for us too an outstanding point of the whole year. Many Greek brethren had expressed their desire to attend. But finally only seven had the excellent blessing of attending that wonderful feast. At the end of over twenty years we again attended an assembly of the Lord’s people and even of such a tremendous size. We took care to draw the greatest possible benefit and blessing therefrom. We are thankful to Jehovah for what our eyes saw and our ears heard during the eight days of this not-to-be-forgotten assembly. We are now back in our assigned position of service and are taking care to convey the spirit of this Theocracy’s Increase Assembly to all our brethren in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GUATEMALA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of preaching the good news continues in the Central American country of Guatemala. Most of the brethren are poor in the things of this world; and, as is the case in almost every part of the earth, the cost of living is quite high. For the publishers as well as the people generally this means long hours of work in order to provide a decent and proper living for themselves. They are slaves to the customs and standards of the world. What a joy it will be when the new world is established and the people can devote time to things other than the drudgery of just slaving to keep alive! Coming to a knowledge of the truth and learning of the only true God of the universe and his Son means everlasting life. Oftentimes it means a new way of life through entering the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font5">Guatemala is another country where the missionaries were very happy to return from the convention and to find all of the publishers hard at work taking care of the interest that was left behind. The branch servant gives us a report of what has been accomplished, and some of the experiences are here published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first really outstanding event of the year was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Morgan in December (already related in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower).</span><span class="font4"> Brother Knorr’s arrangements for expansion were put into effect and with many corresponding joys and blessings. Here in the capital we have never been able to use any of the theaters for public talks, but the brethren in going out to some of the smaller towns and working found managers more co-operative and less greedy for money and thus were able to get theaters several times to put on their hour lectures! At one small town 250 persons attended, as many as we sometimes have during circuit assemblies. Isolated brethren have been visited, aided in the service, and lectures have been successfully put on in the homes of these isolated persons. In one such case, 50 persons crowded into the living room and 50 more stood outside the doorway in the street and listened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second outstanding event was the New York convention. All 17 of the Gilead missionaries were able to attend, as well as 6 of the local brethren. The absence of these brethren put much more responsibility on those remaining, and generally this resulted in much good as they put forth a greater effort to take care of the work; and now that all have returned, these are able to assist much more than previously. It also proved that the Lord has an organization of people here who will preach because It is written in His Word and not because some </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">americanos</span><span class="font4"> take them out. Although many of the local brethren attending the convention could not understand English, through the Spanish meetings they got the most of the Information, and the association with such a great number of brethren was something they just can’t describe to their brethren. When there is any mention of it, they just seem to glow and radiate the spirit and joy of their experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every opportunity to witness should be so used, and that as soon as you start learning the truth. One of the Gilead graduates went to see a person with whom she conducts a study, an old lady who can’t read and who has a hard time making a living. She had made arrangements for the sister to go with her to some people she had talked to (she says she talks to everyone about the truth). She took the sister down, down, down into a ravine in a poor section of the city, to people who had a restaurant. The restaurant consisted of a roof of cloth supported by poles, which sheltered a table and a couple of chairs, with an outdoor fire. The book-study lady had washed dishes for the restaurant people and talked to them, a young man and his mother. The man wanted to know how to get “Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and a Bible. This was quickly shown to him and a study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are some of the little experiences stemming from the greatest experience a person can have, namely that of being a publisher. May all those who have entered into this Joy continue therein, thus contributing to the further increase of Jehovah’s praisers in this land, saving themselves and others, to the vindication of our God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Gilead graduates in Haiti have had a steady, uphill pull. This is a very backward country, but the missionaries have been persistent in their preaching of the gospel. In the last two years they have had very good results in finding the “other sheep”, and during the past year there was a 48 per cent increase which brought much joy to their hearts. Now there is a peak of 99 publishers, so they have a good, working organization for serving those who want to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is often the case in poor countries, the missionaries from the different religious organizations that go there bribe the natives to come to their church or chapel by constantly giving them material gifts. This custom makes it difficult for Jehovah’s witnesses, because the only gift they have, though certainly the greatest, is the gift of life through the Word of God. It takes many persons a number of years to appreciate that this is the greatest of all gifts and that they shall not live by bread alone. However, it appears that when they once get the truth they stick with it and rejoice in the truth, knowing that it means everlasting life. The branch servant relates some interesting happenings which all will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public meetings in Creole (the popular language) were responsible for the steady increase witnessed in Haiti this service year. We can really say it was our first taste of expansion. The first years had witnessed a lot of hard, persistent work, but very few new publishers were forthcoming. This was because the new brethren were slow to understand and follow instructions. They were not accustomed to organization. The country being extremely poor, many left the Catholic church in hope of bettering their lot by joining up with Protestant groups. Some thought we should aid them too, and thereby win them over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has taken time to show them the difference between those religious ways and Jehovah’s witnesses; that they should not expect something in addition, because they were learning the truth. Since then the few publishers we started out with have improved. Much patience exercised in instructing them worked a gradual change. Continually putting into practice the help and instruction given us by Brother Knorr helped our brethren advance; such as giving our public talks in Creole, having our Bible studies and company meetings in Creole, because very few actually speak or understand French (the official language of Haiti), it being a difficult language for the majority of the people here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year of 1950, we have felt expansion to some extent, as in other countries. We rejoice to see the publishers more regular at company meetings, having a full share in all branches of the service. Aiding each publisher individually was the main factor to expansion. More personal study opened their eyes to the importance of devoting more time in the field. Many saw their duty of making more back-calls, which resulted in more studies. This brought the average up to one study per company publisher during the year. Putting on public meetings each Sunday kept the publishers regular in the service. Arranging for meetings at the area studies also encouraged the publishers to be more active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three publishers have heeded the call for more pioneers. One of these is a young married sister. It takes much faith and zeal to take this step in Haiti, because part-time employment is a hard thing to obtain, and pioneers have had very few placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes the circuit servant, accompanied by another missionary, starts out on his bicycle to serve the companies. Buses would take about as long to get one there. They carry about thirty pounds of literature on their bicycles, with a few other necessities, and witness as they travel. A hundred miles or more are covered to reach the first company. Back-calls are arranged with those of good will for future trips. These visits are made twice a year. At the same time publie lectures are given in small villages not too far distant from the small companies visited. Then quite a few of the brethren cover as many as 35 kilometers on foot or by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bourrique </span><span class="font4">(donkey) to help advertise the talk. In one of these an isolated brother had 23 study attenders. They were organized into a company a few months ago, and now in this small place of St. Louis du Sud there are 7 publishers. Recently four of these made several attempts in a small home-constructed sailboat to reach a small island of 3,000 population, but thus far have failed because of incessant rains. They are determined and very zealous and will yet succeed to carry the Kingdom message to Ils-a-Vache for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What work has been (lone out of town has been done mostly by the Gilead missionaries. Practically all of the coastal towns of any size have been worked once this year. Hinche, in the interior, was also covered and much literature was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are very thankful to Jehovah for the service privileges of this past year and the increase in number of publishers that he has given us. We are now better prepared, with tlie help of more publishers than formerly, to pusli ahead in the ingathering of the harvest which is so abundantly manifesting itself from all sides.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work on the many islands of the Hawaiian group is progressing well. There has been a steady increase with better organization and greater efficiency, and unity and love have been shown among the brethren. Of course, this has brought forth excellent results. It is with real joy that the Hawaiian brethren have learned they achieved a 34 per cent increase in number of publishers during the past year, with a peak of 332 Kingdom announcers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hawaiian brethren in Honolulu had an unusually blessed time because of the many travelers who passed through that port, going to and from the convention, and were pleased to meet their fellow workers from the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, and other points to the west. Along with all the publishers throughout the world, those in the Territory of Hawaii were particularly interested in the convention, eagerly looking forward to the reports and rejoicing with those privileged to be among the throngs assembled in New York for Theocracy’s Increase Assembly. Now they are determined to push ahead by the Lord’s grace with even greater effort, and this zeal is reflected in the following report from the branch servant for Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sincere thanks to Jehovah are given when we note also the wonderful increase in the number of home Bible studies. It was found that a monthly average of 539 studies were conducted, to compare with 374 for last year, an increase of 44 per cent. Many of good will are eager to learn about the Bible and Jehovah’s purposes; hence Bible studies are quite easy to start and it is not hard for the publishers to become ‘study conscious’. Many of these sheep are making marvelous progress in a relatively short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year we were hosts to several groups of Gilead missionaries on their way to their foreign assignments. Two groups went to Japan and another was destined for Korea. It was a real joy to meet these brethren and send them off with our best Christian ‘alohas’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Memorial time proved to be another very joyous season here as it is world-wide. Each company was urged to have its own Memorial celebration this year and to encourage the good-will to associate for the occasion. When the reports came in it was found that a total of 570 were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are always Interested In the activities of the pioneers, and Hawaii is no exception. The latter part of June a pioneer couple arranged their affairs to reopen the pioneer work on the island of Maui. Largely in the grip of religion and self-satisfaction, this island has posed quite a problem in the past to Jehovah’s ministers. But with Jehovah’s spirit as their guide they pushed ahead. Listen to this encouraging note sent in with the July report: “The end of the first month finds us in the best of health and highest of spirits. We are finding many people of good will who desire to know about Jehovah and the new world. Studies are accumulating faster than we expected. Street witnessing is now carried on every Saturday, two new publishers doing this work for the first time. We are planning to start a series of public lectures beginning In August.” Later reports are equally encouraging, especially the work being done with the newly released </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> in Hawaiian. A relative of one of the pioneers, who reads and speaks Hawaiian, has agreed to assist the publishers to learn the fundamentals of Hawaiian; and so after the English book study those interested stay for a study In the Hawaiian </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> This man, a preacher of religion, has had the publications for a long time and it may be that, through his assistance in the language, he may finally come to a knowledge of the truth for his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Needless to say we were glad to receive the Hawaiian translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> Although most of the younger generation speak English there are many of the older Hawaiians who will appreciate this book in their native tongue. Already studies are being conducted with this new instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By His grace and strength given through His spirit we hope to go on to achieve greater things in this blessed work, seeking out those who are ‘sheeplike’ and instructing them in the way that means everlasting life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark198"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The joys of service in the Lord’s organization are many; yet it is not without problems that these joys are realized. It is essential that the Lord’s organization keep high standards for all associated to follow. The Lord’s Word sets this high standard, and he does not ask anyone to do the impossible. But he does point out that the way to receive life is to do that which is right. A number of persons who were associating with the Lord’s organization in Honduras wanted to live according to their own desires; so when it was pointed out by the branch organization that the company organizations must follow the principles set for us in the Lord’s Word, many of such persons left. However, this did not discourage those who were determined to preach the good news and help righteously disposed ones to learn the truth and live properly in order to gain life in the new world. They fully appreciate that to know Jehovah God and his Son means everlasting life; so they must continue to take in knowledge of these two as the source of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to a falling away, and a migration of some brethren to other countries because of local conditions, there was a decrease in the number of publishers in Honduras. The organization is strong, though, and it is believed that in 1951 excellent strides will be made in finding the “other sheep”. The branch servant gives us some interesting items which show the entire organization is moving ahead in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The big event to which we had been looking forward for four years took place this year. Brother Knorr and his secretary Brother Morgan were scheduled to visit our country. After consultation with the companies it was decided to hold our first national assembly. Months in advance the brethren on the north coast made plans to attend. Saving money enough for air travel isn’t too easy for most of our poor brethren, but they wanted to get to that assembly. Some sold their chickens; one sister worked late making candy to be sold on the streets; another brother sacrificed the family cow to get his fare; little things and big things were done and they made it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the outset this assembly was different from any held heretofore in Tegucigalpa. More local brethren took part in it. Better and more advertising was brought into play. A regular radio interview was given by representatives from the Society’s branch office. Weekly announcements over the various programs sharpened the interest of the people for the coming discourse “Liberty to the Captives”. For the first time sandwich sign placards were used for street walking, which were new not only to the brethren, but also to the town people. Businessmen came out of their stores to look. Passers-by accepted the handbills and remarked, “What will they think of next?” A priest, brandishing his cane, dashing up and down alongside one of the colored sisters who was quietly passing out handbills, shouted to the crowd, “Don’t accept them, don’t accept them!” The sister handed the priest one, which he forgot to throw away, and then proceeded to hand the “crowd” one. No, there was no doubt about what had come to town. A Jehovah’s witnesses convention! The largest number yet turned out to hear the public talk, the total being 511.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reaching into new territory the circuit servant was able to contact two of the untouched bay Islands, Utlla and Guanaja. These are inhabited by white descendants of English and Scottish mixture as well as a scattering of the Carib Negro whose lineage can be traced back to Africa. Being isolated as they are on their little islands, religion and meeting night constitute the hub of social life and activity. As one old-timer put it, “There are three things to do on our island: tend our coconut crops, raise kids, and go to meeting.” They have done marvelously well with the first two, but with the last they are admittedly in a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Especially on the island of Utila the animosity among the three religions is strong. “The Church of God has put the Adventists in ‘hell-fire’; the Adventists condemn the other two to destruction because they eat pork and use grease when they cook, and besides they don’t keep Sabbath. The Methodists hold themselves aloof and say they are the ones going to heaven. We’re sick and tired of religion, Mister!” Thus did a young couple disgustedly express themselves to the publisher at their door. Before the three-day visit was over with, the husband was publicly telling his neighbors he was going to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Both he and his wife took part in inviting the town to hear the public talk scheduled to be given on the main street corner. After the 150 or more had dispersed, one islander came up and said, &quot;Young feller, that’s the truth. It ain’t false religion we want, It’s Christianity. I’ll take one of your books.” While no return visit has been made yet to these Islands, It is with keen anticipation that we will do so soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many isolated good-will persons scattered throughout our territory. This is more true in and around the banana camps on our north coast. Some of our publishers, in order to hold down their secular jobs, have to travel from camp to camp following their bosses to their new jobs. Each place they stop they group together, usually the cooks, maids and hired hands, and start studies with them. One such study has shown marvelous results. The study was being held with the wife of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mandador</span><span class="font4"> or overseer of the camp. But here again the publisher had to move on to another job. After an interval of time the circuit servant and one of the local special pioneers made a trip to this camp to follow up the interest. It was found that the study had not died down but was being conducted by the senora regularly and that she was thinking about being baptized at our next visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness all of the Gilead graduates and two of the native Honduran’s were able to attend the Theocracy’s Increase convention In New York city. Along with the experiences, reports and new releases pertinent to our country of Spanish language we were able to make our brethren here feel the spirit of joy and love that abounded at the assembly. We are enthused with our brethren throughout the world to be fearless now and to hold high the Signal during the year ahead, 1951.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Hungary know that their brethren throughout the whole world are boldly fighting in season and out of season for the spread of the gospel and to promote the true worship of Jehovah God. The brethren in Hungary are willing to stand alongside those suffering abuse, privation and slander for righteousness’ sake; and they are happy and grateful to Jehovah God for the privilege of being associated with His people. They do not have the publications to use as do Jehovah’s witnesses in other parts of the world; they can use only the Bible and preach by word of mouth. They are closely watched by the religionists and the authorities, and the press has published many libelous articles against them. However, all of this has not been successful in turning people away from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of these attacks not only have strengthened the brethren, but have caused the people of good will to seek them out. The average number of publishers in Hungary increased from 1,410 to 1,910 during the past year. This was a 35 per cent increase in a land behind the iron curtain. There were 5,593 individuals in attendance at the Memorial. Now the brethren are looking forward to the year 1951 with joy and delight to have a share in Theocracy’s increase. The branch servant sent through some information which will be of interest to all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> readers and will stimulate Jehovah’s witnesses to press on in the work whether the season be favorable or unfavorable to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy watch with gnashing teeth the fearless advance movement and the growing numbers of God’s people, and although they are themselves under pressure and hate the present political system very much, they flatter it in order to use it in their even greater hatred toward Jehovah’s witnesses. Two sisters worked some rural territory with good success. They were just having a Bible study with 25 attentive listeners when the local priest, accompanied by two young men, burst into the meeting and immediately asked the two sisters what right they had to hold a meeting here. After the sisters had put the priest to shame by their quiet answers, he addressed the householder with the words: “I consider it my moral duty to warn you not to listen to these false doctrines.” The interested man, none abashed, answered ironically: “Well, Mr. Priest, you consider it your moral duty to warn us now, but you didn’t consider it your moral duty to warn us when in this very same house we feasted and reveled and wasted our time in uselessness.” At this the priest and his two companions cleared out of the house. A little later police officers came and arrested the two sisters, and they were then sentenced to 60 days’ imprisonment for “vagrancy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another place seven persons informed the priest that they were leaving the church. He was very arrogant and called these people of good will “imperialists”. When they went to the civil authorities to settle the matter finally according to law, the official received them angrily and with hostility said: “You are hirelings of the imperialists, aren’t you?” The brethren learned later that the priest had phoned telling the official to expect them and flagrantly misrepresenting them. The brethren handed the Irritated man a memorandum issued by us, and, after he had read it, he immediately changed his attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our activity, especially that from house to house, is followed very attentively not only by the clergy but also by the communists. The householder and the political agent of every house has orders to watch peddlers, not only in cities, but also In the rurals. Frequently in recent months the publishers have been stopped immediately after beginning their work. When a publisher knocks at the door of an evil-inclined householder or a fanatical communist, he is turned over to the nearest police official, who is under obligation to take him to the police office, where he is kept under arrest for a longer or shorter period. During the past year there were 302 such arrests, but in most cases the brethren were released the same day; in a few instances they were kept in custody from two to eight days. It always depends upon the attitude of the officials as to how the brethren are treated. Occasionally the publishers have been beaten or otherwise very harshly dealt with. But in most cases the officials have been polite and even friendly. The firm, bold and frank attitude of the brethren often called forth recognition from even brutally disposed officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The government Itself has Issued no decree against us, but from questions which are asked in police hearings we can see that among the communists and generally among the officials the opinion prevails that Jehovah’s witnesses are the secret mercenaries of the American Imperialists and are paid by America. At every arrest and likewise on other occasions the investigation is time and again directed Into this channel, the officials attempting to gather evidence for their supposition. This they do in vain, of course, because there is no such evidence. It even happens that they try to forge such “proofs” in order to be able to sentence the brethren. Such a case was reported to us by a company servant. He writes as follows: “In a village of our company territory there is a group of people of good will with whom a brother has a regular company book study. On one occasion two brothers of our company wished to accompany the study conductor on a visit to these interested ones. He gladly accepted their company, seeing that the way leads through a river and a forest. The study over, the brothers proceeded on their way home but were stopped by two police officials and taken to the police station. At the station their Bibles were taken from them and one of the brothers saw that something was slipped into one of the Bibles. Then the charge was raised against them that a letter was found in one of their Bibles showing that they correspond with America and await the Americans. The brothers vehemently denied this charge, and they were terribly beaten up. Some of the officials present disapproved of this brutal procedure and said : “Why do you beat these men like this? They are innocent, they have done nothing to deserve such treatment.” Later on the brothers were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we had 21 arrests resulting In court cases. Five ended with acquittals, but in sixteen cases the brethren had to serve sentences of from 2 to 18 months. Ten brothers received sentences of from 6 to 18 months for refusing military service. Twenty-three brethren lost their jobs because they did not want to give &quot;Caesar” what belongs to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you know, we cannot give public lectures either. But the brethren seize every opportunity of participating as often as possible in the public activity. Public lectures can be given only at burial services. We conducted 72 such services, whereby the hope of eternal life was preached to from 100 to 800 listeners each time. The following experience shows clearly how willing the brethren are to witness publicly with their whole heart and strength till their last remaining breath. One of the circuit servants reported the following: “I visited sick brethren in the hospital. The doctor shows great interest in the truth. He told me that on the upper floor there was a brother from some village who would live only a few days. He was to be operated on for cancer of the stomach and liver, but after the incision had been made it was seen that the case was entirely hopeless. So the wound was sewn up again without operating. The doctor asked me to visit the brother and tell him that he had only a few days to live, a fact which they were not allowed to tell the patients, he said. This doctor had already treated several Witnesses and he was impressed by the faith which they had shown on their sickbeds or while undergoing operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I greeted the brother and asked him how he was. ‘I thank you,’ he said, ‘since the operation I have not had such great pain and also my appetite is coming back again.’ His answer surprised me. of course, and so I decided to tell him the truth. ‘I am glad you feel well, but we shall be really well only in the new world. You have the hope of the resurrection, haven’t you?’ ‘Oh, even if I had to die, I would not fear death.’ ‘I know,’ I said, ‘and for that reason I have come to tell you that the doctors cannot help you any more. My father died of the same sickness, and you will sleep too.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He was indignant that the doctors had not told him, but there was no trace of fear or despair in his voice. ‘It is a good thing that you have come,' he said. ‘I shall ask the doctors to let me go home immediately, because I do not want to die here. Nobody knows me here, and nobody would come to my funeral, while at home I am well known, for I was the first to begin publishing the truth there, and thanks be to God there is now a nice active company in that place. The whole village will be present at my burial and a good witness will be given of the hope of the resurrection and of the blessings of the Kingdom.’ During this conversation the doctor who treated him had come in, and he and the other patients in the ward had heard our conversation. ‘Look at this man,’ the doctor said to the others, ‘he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He is so sick that in a few days he will die, and now you have heard his words. He suffers from a terribly painful disease and yet he does not wail and lament like so many whose sickness is not so serious. You can see here the difference between the death of a man of faith and the one that is without faith.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The brother then made the journey of 240 miles home and a few days later he died and there were 500 people at his burial, the circuit servant proclaiming to them the comforting message of the Kingdom. Thus the last wish of the brother was fulfilled that at his death a witness regarding Jehovah’s purposes should be given. During his life he had been a zealous witness and now he gave his last witness by his death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have been able to get only a few Bibles recently. Formerly we bought them from the British and Foreign Bible Society, but this Society having ceased to operate some time ago, Bibles are published only by the General Reformed Convention, and they are supplying them only to those who have become members of the League of Free Churches. When we submitted our requests, they did not frankly tell us they did not want to give us any, but their decision has been postponed time and again. Later on I was Informed that they were instructed not to sell any Bibles to Jehovah’s witnesses for the reason that they use it to publish tiie end of the world and thus work harm among the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The relationship between India and Pakistan continues to be about as friendly as that of two peeved and sulky schoolboys vying with each other over which should be the “top dog” and have highest prestige in the eyes of the world. It appears that each government despises the other. No exchange of money is allowed between the two countries, nor can literature be shipped between India and Pakistan. Literature from outside countries is admissible to either country, so the Society can ship literature to both India and Pakistan but not from one to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite these conditions, the work goes on in both places and throughout all the territory under the Indian branch. It is the steady, plodding work of faithful publishers, backed up by God’s spirit, that counts in this territory. Jehovah has blessed the efforts of the brethren, but they are all up against terrific difficulties. It would be easy to become discouraged working among the Moslems, Hindus and the other very religious people were it not for the knowledge that God has declared that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached. Sincere Christians continue to preach the good news, and we have a report from the branch servant on India, Pakistan, Iran and Ceylon. As long as the Lord gives us the opportunity to keep trying to get the message to these people, the Society will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We still have our problems, of course. Looking at India as a whole we have scarcely started witnessing to the nation as yet. Religion and language are our chief obstacles, but particularly religion. A questionnaire was sent to all companies and isolated pioneers, asking how the work among non-Christian communities was progressing. The answers are illuminating. In all India 114 home Bible studies are at present being conducted with people professing Hindu, Buddhist, or other non-Christian faiths. In addition to these there have been about 100 studies commenced, and later discontinued for various reasons, but chiefly lack of interest, or fear. Thirty-four non-Christians are now attending company meetings at Kingdom Halls, eleven participate to some extent in field service, and two have been baptized. This represents verj’ much hard work in an effort to break through the barriers of religious superstition and custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then we have the language problem. We are still yearning for publishers capable of preaching to the people in their native tongue. We are gradually building up vernacular literature for them, but so often it is a case of placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font4"> In some vernacular with a person who cannot speak English, and we are unable to follow up with a more detailed explanation of the subject. W’e now have literature in stock or being printed In Bengali, Gujarati, Kanarese, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian, Tamil and Urdu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most Interesting in this non-Christian field Is a report from Calcutta, where Gilead graduates have pushed this feature of work successfully. One Hindu with whom a graduate conducted a study opened his home for a group study. For three months the average attendance has been six adults, all Hindus. A series of public meetings was also held there, with an average attendance of ten Hindus and four or five others. “One of the three attending Kingdom Hall meetings gave his first student talk last week, and did very well,” says the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Like all other communities there is a wide range of difference between individuals. Some speak evil and angrily of the Bible, while others have an outward respect for it. The general rule, though, among those who say they respect the Bible is that they “respect” anything and everything which may be associated with religion. They are just “religious”. They have a superstitious awe for everything religious. Rather than take chances they will render lip service to all the “gods” available, and It is a very common thing to find the homes of such people a veritable museum of religious pictures and images; with “the Sacred Heart”, the Virgin Mary, the Fatima statue, and sundry others all mixed in with Zoroaster, and the multitude of Hindu “gods”. They garland each one in turn when their supposed birthday comes around. It is not easy to get these people to see that demon religion is a snare, not the real worship of God, and that the Bible Is different. The fact remains, however, that there are some who see something of the truth, and are amazed at the message of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Press and Publication. It has been a joy to see the advancement in our press department. We have no professional printers, and last year we struggled hard to get our small platen press working in a shed two miles from the branch office. It was inconvenient, in dirty surroundings, and without electric light or fans. But we made a start You then authorized us to renovate an old shed on the premises at the back of the branch office. We have had the press running here since January, and now have a clean, airy, and convenient place in which to work. We have electric light and fans, and now our press is running by electric motor instead of foot treadle. From being three months behind schedule with the Malayalam </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> we are now regularly half a month ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our printing work is chiefly the Malayalam </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">once a month, Malayalam </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> and English handbills. We are equipped for these two languages, and recently we printed the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel</span><span class="font4"> booklet in Malayalam, besides all the most necessary service forms. One very big job for us has been the setting up in type of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> in Malayalam. Proofs have been pulled on art paper and sent to the Brooklyn factory for photoengraving and printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All our vernacular literature is being produced by this method. It may be more costly for small runs, such as we require, but we have the satisfaction of handling a first-class product, so much superior to the average publication printed in India. Of course, we have to go to outside firms for typesetting in languages other than Malayalam, and this adds to the cost, but during the year we have had produced the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font4"> in Tamil and Gujarati, and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font4"> in Sinhalese. We also produce a small run of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Kana-rese, mimeographed, once a month, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> in English, by this means.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There has been an increase of 22 per cent In average number of publishers for the year, which is excellent, especially In the face of the difficulties presented by a Moslem population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sixty-eight Bible studies were started during the year in the homes of Moslems. Fifty were discontinued, chiefly because of the peculiar home life of the Moslem community. Seldom does a publisher receive an Invitation to enter the home of a Moslem, because of their secluded womenfolk. More often than not the publisher is invited to visit the man at his office or shop, and it is very difficult to keep a Bible study going in such surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four Moslems are regularly attending the Kingdom Hall study meetings. Public meetings have also been held regularly : a hundred throughout the year, and there has been an average attendance of 20 Moslems. All field service, however, is done by publishers who professed “Christianity” before they came to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Placing literature is relatively easy in Karachi, and the special magazine campaign resulted in the obtaining of 483 new subscriptions (for a company of only 33, with three pioneers). But the local Gilead graduates, in their report, say “our great drawback is bridging back-calls into home Bible studies”. The reasons are as stated above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two Gilead graduates and one general pioneer have worked really hard during the year. Their hours are well above quota, and they have set a fine example in devotion to service. It is hoped that conditions between the Indian</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and Pakistan governments may improve during the coming year so that we in India may enjoy closer association with our brethren in Pakistan. There is much work to be done, but the laborers are few.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is also a large population of Tamil-speaking people in Ceylon. These are Indians imported chiefly for labor purposes. The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font4"> has recently been published in Tamil, and this has opened up a new field for these publishers to work. The Tamilians are mostly Hindu, though many belong to the Roman Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magazine street work in Colombo drew the wrath of the local communists during the year. They published some scurrilous attacks upon the witnesses, accusing them of antinationalistic activities; while some of the religious churchgoers were driven to jealousy by the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses and published articles commending their zeal as an incentive to their own flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Like most countries in Asia since the war, Ceylon is a land of self-assertive pride in its ancient &quot;culture” and pagan religion. It blinds its people to the truth and the humility necessary for learning God’s ways. But the witnesses are zealous in their efforts to penetrate this barrier of pride. They held a very successful series of public meetings in the open air on Colombo’s famous Galle Face, a long stretch of beach where Colombians take the air after oilice hours, with a total of 45 meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the coming year attention needs to be paid to the improvement in individual house-to-house work and return visits on people who show a spirit of good will. We look forward to greater expansion as this is done, aided as it will be by having the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘‘The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> available in Sinhalese. We look forward to more home Bible-study work as a result.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>IRAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">At the head of the Persian Gulf is the extensive oil town of Abadan. It is here where the Kingdom message has been proclaimed during the year by one lone publisher. He is a native Persian, so well able to speak the language of the country. He also finds much scope for work among Armenians and French-speaking people. He has one booklet in Persian, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font4"> but his placements have been chiefly in English among the employees of the oil company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One home Bible study has been conducted fairly regularly throughout the year, but there is need for better organization in order to make for expansion. There Is a small “Christian” population to work among, but the majority of the populace are Mohammedans.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While the pope calls for a “holy year” to be celebrated in Rome during 1950, Jehovah’s witnesses go ahead steadily in the land of Italy, rendering holy devotion to Jehovah God and working in the interests of his holy kingdom. Despite the obstacles and problems that the ministers of God face there, all were able to make excellent progress during the service year. One of the difficulties that could have slowed down the work in Italy was the effort put forth to remove the Gilead graduates from that land. But by the Lord’s grace we were successful in having them return and continue in their witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newspapers have given good publicity to the preaching of the gospel in Italy, but more important than that have been the new publications furnished by the Society for the edification of the brethren, including the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization,</span><span class="font5"> which proved a great aid to the companies. The work in Italy was favored with a 69 per cent increase; so now there are 1,211 publishers, the peak for the 1950 service year. The branch servant gave an interesting report, parts of which are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even before the twenty-eight missionaries had arrived in Italy in March, 1949, the office had made regular application requesting one-year visas for all of them. At first the officials indicated that the government looked at the matter from an economic point of view and hence the situation seemed quite assuring for our missionaries. After six months we suddenly received a communication from the Ministry of the Interior ordering our brethren to leave the country by the end of the month, with less than a week’s notice. Naturally, we refused to accept this order without a legal battle, and every effort was made to get at the bottom of the matter to find out who was responsible for this foul blow. By contacting individuals who worked in the Ministry we learned that our files revealed no complaints by the police or other authorities and that, therefore, only gome “higher up” could be responsible. Who could it be? A friend In the Ministry informed us that the action against our missionaries was quite strange, since the government’s policy was very lenient and favorable as regards American citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maybe the embassy might be of help. Personal visits at the embassy and numerous conferences with the ambassador’s secretary all proved futile. It was most evident, even as American officials admitted, that some one who wielded much power in the Italian government did not want Watch Tower missionaries preaching in Italy. Against this strong power American diplomats only shrugged their shoulders and said, “Well, you know, the Catholic Church is the state religion here and they practically do what they please.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From September to December we stalled the Ministry’s action against the missionaries. Finally, a deadline was set; the missionaries had to be out of the country by December 31. There was nothing left to do but comply with these orders. We sent the missionaries into the Italian-speaking section of Switzerland. In a few months the entire group was back in Italy, preaching once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This time they were assigned to different cities, but, then, this would only make the work spread out all the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what about the good-will interest that the missionaries had found in the previous cities assigned? Tile “sheep” were not to be abandoned. Brother Knorr approved the selection of new Italian special pioneers to occupy the homes of the missionaries and carry on the good work. No time was lost in accomplishing the transition and the work did not suffer. The result of this incident was that the Word went into new virgin fields.—Acts 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The continual increase in number of publishers necessitated more circuit servants for the five circuits that serve the 90 different companies on the peninsula. Hence, three brethren were selected during the year for this service. Eight circuit assemblies were held and these too contributed much in getting the brethren organized and prepared for more effective witnessing in the future. More and more are the circuit assemblies beginning to resemble the well-organized assemblies held in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We quote a few excerpts from one of a circuit servant’s letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Sunday morning I arranged for group witnessing in a small </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paese</span><span class="font4"> that Is located castle-style on the side of a mountain. There were eleven of us in the group. We started our work about seven o’clock in the morning and in no time at all I had a house full of people listening to the message. While we were enjoying the service, on the main street above us a storm was raging in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">piazza</span><span class="font4"> (square). Two priests were forbidding the brethren from going from house to house. A crowd of more than 100 gathered quickly, and the brethren decided that nothing could be accomplished by remaining there. By this time the whole town was in an uproar. Every person that I saw was talking about the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">evangelista.</span><span class="font4"> Despite the commotion aroused by the priests, we held our previously announced public meeting and at 11:30, only a half-hour behind schedule, I began the hour talk with 44 present. This was good, considering how many the priests had scared away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After the talk the brethren left and the family where I had given the talk invited me to a dish of spaghetti. After such a busy morning I welcomed this chance to sit down and eat in peace. But, no sooner had I gotten started when people began to come in from all over, men and women, young and old. So, between mouthfuls of spaghetti I had to give another talk that lasted hours. One group of young girls had me cornered, throwing one question after another at me. While answering one girl, another one would grab my arm requesting information. Many subjects were discussed: images, war, Peter, hell-fire, purgatory, the new world, etc. This lasted until nine o’clock that night. I was exhausted, so I thought it was time to call it a day, postponing our discussion until the following night. On my way out, the daughter of the company servant who had had no use for the truth and wouldn’t even speak to me the first two days of my visit followed me outside and said, ‘I also want to become one of those </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘proclamatori’</span><span class="font4"> I assured her that we would be glad to help her become a publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So, as this fourth year of theocratic expansion comes to a close with one more peak month, the tenth for the year, we cannot help but call to mind Brother Knorr’s encouraging words on his last visit to Italy in May, 1947. Yes, his hope that soon there would be 1,000 Kingdom announcers from one end of the country to the other has been not only realized, but also surpassed by far. In March we had our first 1,000 publishers, and in August we closed the service year with more than 1,200 publishers. Our goal is now 2,000 and, by God’s grace, we will do our utmost to attain this goal during 1951. Though Rome may be a converging center these days for thousands of “pilgrims”, Jehovah’s witnesses are busy here about their Father’s business, Kingdom business. We are thankful to Jehovah that we have a healthy organization established, that we have had eight stimulating circuit assemblies, that there are now 29 Gilead missionaries in nine cities doing special work, that w’e have gone over the 1,200 mark, that we have had a new book and several new booklets along with our </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel</span><span class="font4"> booklet. Yes, for all these blessings we thank Jehovah, because it is by his mercy, by his undeserved kindness, that all this has been possible; and we submit this report with great joy, recognizing that all honor and credit go to him alone.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s spirit is very manifest upon the servants who are looking after Kingdom interests in Jamaica. Due to the circuit assemblies, the public meeting, back-call and Bible-study work, there was a marked increase in the number of publishers. The religious organizations in Jamaica are worried about the excellent progress being made by Jehovah’s witnesses, and they have started a campaign of “Christ for Jamaica”. But even though all the religions try to merge as one, they do not have success in gathering together interested people as Jehovah’s witnesses have. They admit Jehovah’s witnesses have the spirit, but they do not give them credit for having received the spirit from God. That is the force behind Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is getting something done. How strange it is for so-called Christian organizations to object to the good work done by Jehovah’s witnesses and call their zeal the spirit of the Devil! Still they tell their people they ought to have a similar spirit so they would get some work done!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the Word is having a telling effect on the people on the island of Jamaica. The branch servant’s report shows what wonderful strides of progress have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five new peaks of publishers, with increases in number of back-calls and home Bible studies during the year, have been the blessing of Jehovah, till now. We have an average number of publishers of 2,120, which is 20 per cent Increase over last year. We are happy to report a new peak of 2,380 publishers In July. Because the Island’s population is 1,388 898, one publisher therefore has 655 persons to care for with the Word of Jehovah. Faithful caring for the sheep has resulted In 346 good-will persons’ being baptized during the year. This past year has disclosed much public concern by the clergy over the spoiling of their pastures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The secretary of the “Christian Council” movement says the “people are hungry for God and for truth”. Hungry people go where food Is. The fact that many of the churches are practically empty shows they are not relieving the “food shortage”. There is even a shortage of “parsons” for the Anglican church, it is reported. The newly Installed bishop for the island has stated they would be supplied from England, but sufficient stipends must be guaranteed first. He said “No pay, no clergy” Is the rule he would have to stand by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Christian Council's” “Christ for Jamaica” campaign is not accomplishing its end, because the conditions get worse and worse, and at the same time more hungry sheep learn of Jehovah's kingdom and add themselves to his witnesses who are increasing praise to him. In Port Royal recently a “parson” went to church to preach but no one came and he had to go home I But Jehovah’s witnesses gave two public talks on the Bible there recently to receptive audiences of 260 and 217!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One “parson” sermonized on “Who are the Jehovah’s witnesses?” one Sunday to his congregation. After telling </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his own</span><span class="font4"> version of what we teach (mostly all not correct) and telling </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his own</span><span class="font4"> version of our history, he concluded with the unexpected admission: “But they know their Bible, they put us to shame. They have a burning zeal in carrying on their work. This must be the spirit of the Devil, but out of evil comes good, so the audience can copy the witnesses’ example by studying the Scriptures so that they might have the right spirit to expound the truth as Jehovah’s witnesses do lies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, by circuit servants, and at assemblies, regularity in service is being stressed along with increased back-call and home Bible-study work. It is bringing results, as the report shows, even though three of our circuit servants have left for Gilead. Two graduated from the 15th class and, by the Lord’s grace, three of our brethren have gone for the 16th class to be better trained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, not forgotten is the largest event of 1950! Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York, which 32 of us were privileged to attend. As If catching up the spirit of increase, the number of publishers in July reached a new peak of 2,380! August was part of our Island-wide rainy season and slowed down the work a bit, but, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we are all determined to increase our efforts to praise the Most High in 1951 service year and we are anxiously awaiting the new literature released at the New York assembly, especially the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> to assist us in doing so.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work is just getting started in Japan, and Jehovah our God has surely been a loving provider for his people there. The Japanese are like all other people living throughout the world. Their interest in the Bible must first be aroused; and the Bible is not a common book in Japan. Their minds must be cleared of traditional thought to appreciate the principles of truth and righteousness that we find in the Bible. The service year of 1950 has been outstanding as far as progress in this field is concerned. The publishers have increased from 8 to 106 within a year. Five companies are now organized; regular assemblies are being held and public meetings arranged; and the 26 graduates of Gilead who are there are delighted with their work. They esteem it a great privilege to be serving the 90 million people of the Japanese islands. Of course, not all have yet had the opportunity to hear the truth; but, if it is the Lord’s will, that is their goal. The interesting report from the branch servant follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many interesting events took place during the year, such as Memorial with attendance of 476 and 16 partakers, with 3,706 at the different public lectures that Sunday ; 28 persons were immersed; and, best of all, the number of Gilead graduates here grew to 26 from 7. All together, 50,148 hours were spent In the witness work, with 16,889 back-calls resulting in 4,809 Bible studies. In fact, for the year each Gilead missionary averaged 19.2 Bible studies, with some conducting from 30 to 37 studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Copies of chapters from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True?’</span><span class="font4"> were mimeographed in Japanese and used in studies, also </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind,</span><span class="font4"> and one issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Japanese. Also, many leaflets and handbills in Japanese were mimeographed and used to good effect. In recent years there has been a great change in the Japanese language with an effort to modernize it. The Bible is so classical in style that many cannot understand it. Now our urgent need is for a translator understanding English and modern Japanese, so as to put the message of the Theocracy in understandable form. However, as the Gilead missionaries continue to progress with their study of Japanese, a greater, more extended witness will be possible, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Actually they all have more studies than they can handle, with teachers, doctors and many who in turn invite others to partake of the water of life. Studies have been conducted in schools with attendances of 60 to 75. Many are attracted by a desire to learn English, but theocratic tact helps them to realize the importance of the truths of the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One missionary group reports the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Arriving in Kobe November 2, it took some time to clean up our house and get everything in shipshape order. But by December 1, we were well started in the witness work. Everything here has been so advantageous for a vigorous start in the work that it could be nothing other than the Lord’s loving provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At the outset there were no Japanese brethren in this locality. So we had to start off witnessing with very little practical knowledge of the language. However, the Japanese people themselves were a great help to us. A lawyer with whom we study in Tarumi has often told us how much the people appreciate our going to their homes. Most foreigners, including missionaries, have set themselves up on a pedestal and do not mix with the Japanese. The missionaries appear with a fanfare of trumpets at ‘Christmas’ and then go into suspended animation for the rest of the year. For the most part, the Japanese are good-natured, patient and truly grateful for our help. They laugh with us over our blunders with the language, and try hard to understand. For example, it is difficult when we are trying to tell them about a ‘heavenly organization’, and our wrong accent changes it into ‘heavenly funeral’ But they persevere with us until they get the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“However, it was immediately apparent that we must reach the people in their own language. So we have been very busy trying to master Japanese. It has not been easy. So far we have concentrated on grammar and Bible conversation, postponing the terrific art of writing Japanese until later. Each morning from eight o’clock, we study Japanese together. Then we practice what we learn through the day. Every house-to-house call, every home Bible study helps us to polish up on our Japanese. We are really ‘in school’ all the time. Even if we do not have the ‘gift of tongues’, Jehovah has gifted us to the point where we can do all our witnessing in a sort-of-Japanese. Not that we can convey all that we want to, but where we meet up with the desire to learn there is no difficulty at all In getting the message across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“From the beginning we have worked hard toward the goal of presenting all our meetings in Japanese. The first opportunity for a Japanese-language meeting came with the Memorial, April 1. The Memorial talk was ably interpreted by a new publisher. The attendance, 180! They packed out three rooms and the hallway, and some listened through the windows. Next morning 35 publishers responded to the call to service. Each missionary had to team up with three or four companions. This all helped to make an impression at the homes. A company was immediately organized, and has increased to a peak of 60 publishers, 10.2 hours, 1.3 back-calls and .3 Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘The next step was the service meeting. Here we began to ‘break in’ several Japanese brethren as interpreters. The Japanese-language demonstrations on Japanese service problems have been greatly enjoyed. Attendance increased to more than eighty, so we had to move from our home to a larger place, a school provided by a person of good will in the town. However, this in turn proved too small, and now we are meeting on the lawn In front of the house. Up to 120 are attending the service meeting. Recently we commenced the theocratic school, with more than 20 brothers enrolled. The open-air setting for our meetings is ideal for the summer, for usually there is a refreshing breeze from the sea and we can put our fans away. The open dome of heaven is the best roof in Japan’s summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When the Korean shooting started, we were concerned about our fellow missionaries there. But not for long. One afternoon we found four of them on the same train as we returned home from witnessing. Two days later the other four walked in the front gate, so that we could have a reunion of eighteen of us from Gilead’s eleventh class. The new arrivals are also having a grand time in the service. Many of our younger publishers have been on vacation during the past two months, and these have spent much time in helping the missionaries get into the swing of witnessing In Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The home Bible study has proved its value as the pivot point of the work. In August all 16 missionaries in Kobe conducted 359 studies, or an average of 22 studies each. Very often several families get together in one home for the study. They are enthusiastic to learn about the truth and Jehovah’s organization.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What once was the country called Latvia is now under the communistic rule of Russia. Years ago the Society used to get reports through its branch office there. Now word comes through to Brooklyn that there are about 28 individuals who are interested in Bible study, and these gather together in small companies. There are five such groups in all where they study the Lord’s Word. They have been able to receive some of the Watch Tower publications during the year, and they have been doing witnessing work. On the average there have been six publishers in the field, and they loan books and booklets to the people who want to read and with whom they study. Only for four months out of the entire year was it possible for reports to come through, but in these four months 128 back-calls were made and an average of 14 Bible studies were being conducted every month with people of good will in addition to private study. If it were possible to get regular reports out of Russia, undoubtedly we would hear much more about similar gatherings in various parts of the Russian domain. We rejoice that these Latvians are receiving meat in due season and still preaching the Word to those who mourn. They are maintaining their integrity and sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark210"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Readers of the Bible know about “the glory of Lebanon”, the cedars of Lebanon. Lebanon is still a beautiful country, but its glory has changed. No more do the great cedars bring beauty to the slopes of Mount Lebanon. The forests do not exist, having been cut away by selfish men. But during the 1950 service year, trees of righteousness have been springing up all over Lebanon to adorn that land. This is the planting of Jehovah, that He may be glorified. (Isa. 61: 3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font5"> These trees of righteousness do not grow on the hillsides of Mount Lebanon, but they have sprung up throughout all the country. They are the zealous publishers for the Kingdom. They are preaching the Word and bringing glory to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is certainly good to know that the gospel of the Kingdom is being preached in this land. The 103 per cent increase in number of publishers shows us that remarkable results can be achieved. This has been an unusual year, and these new publishers did not come into the truth just because everything moved smoothly, for there was much mob action and opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adjoining Lebanon is another country called Syria. The work in this country is directed by the branch servant in Lebanon, and both reports as submitted by the office at Beirut are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One outstanding experience in connection with this expansion is the following: A soldier who was stationed in an area situated between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon range of mountains busied himself on week ends by preaching. He started studies in a couple of homes and conducted them regularly. To his delight he found his students drinking in the truth amazingly fast. He began to realize that there was more interest in the vicinity than what he could take care of. So like a call from Macedonia, he came to the branch and urgently requested that a pioneer be sent there to assist him. This was done and now only 9 months have passed since this brother first began his witnessing there. But out of this activity what has resulted? This: There are now 41 active publishers and 20 of them have been baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the summer some brethren from other companies hired a bus and paid a visit to these new friends by joining with them in the service for a day. The bus stopped in the town that was to be worked and all were assigned their portion of territory. As the brethren were finishing their territory a mob of about 100 men gathered and surrounded 10 of the witnesses. For a few moments a fight ensued, but it stopped immediately when one of a group of soldiers nearby fired his gun in the air and warned the mobsters that if they did not stop he would fire on them. During the short time of fighting the enemy succeeded in tearing up some of the literature and scattering it on the street. Some people picked up the pieces and began to read them. As a result even some who were a part of the mob got a fair knowledge of the truth and are now even thinking of coming to the meetings. One man who had the reputation of being one of the toughest men in town, and whom the people were afraid to offend in the least, came into the truth and is now very active. This has infused courage in the other new ones there. The more “trees of righteousness” that spring up to praise Jehovah, so all the more Satan and his agents are determined to cut them down. A notorious case of mob action broke out in a small village where there was a company of 10 preachers. A mob, led by the son of the local orthodox priest, tried to gain entrance to the house where the brethren were having a meeting. A struggle ensued when our brethren resisted them. This continued for nearly two hours until the authorities came. Upon their arrival, instead of taking into custody the mobsters, they arrested 6 of our brethren. At police headquarters, the chief, a fanatical religionist and egged on by the priest, did his utmost to break their integrity. To the first brother he said, “Renounce this God of yours, Jehovah, and do the sign of the cross.” Came back the reply: “Even if you cut my head off, I would never do that.” One by one their turn came and all refused likewise, each then undergoing a severe beating. The case was referred to higher authorities and now freedom of worship has been restored to the village. After this outrage the zeal of the witnesses there did not diminish, for others Joined them to swell the number to 33 now active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, not the whole service year has been one of mob action. Except for the two incidents mentioned above, Jehovah’s witnesses in Lebanon have had much freedom to preach. Because of this they give thanks to Jehovah, and, as you can see by the report, it is evident that the Lord’s blessings have been with them. We have more than doubled in number of publishers, put out almost twice the amount of literature over that of last year, and we are making more back-calls and conducting more Bible studies than ever before. “Preach the Word” has been the theme, and “preach the word” have we maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many diverse religions in this country, Moslems, Jews, and many sects of name-Christians. But regardless of the beliefs of the people, Jehovah's witnesses have gone to one and all. Just about half of the population is made up of Moslems. In some places if a brother calls on a Moslem home, and if the husband is not at home, the woman being alone in the house is forbidden to see the man. However, we have another class of Moslems that have gone modern to some extent. The women do not cover their faces with a veil but are able to let themselves be seen by men. This being the case, we have encouraged as many sisters as possible during the year to get out in the service going from house to house. A number have become active, rejoicing and having wonderful experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For one to be witnessing in Beirut, the capital and Lebanon’s largest city, it would be an asset for him to know three or four different languages, for he never knows what kind of person he will talk to next. He might find people who speak only Arabic, French, Armenian, Greek, or English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore he should also have a variety of language literature in his case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There still remain many little villages where as yet the witness has not been given, but we are gradually spreading out to reach these. The brethren are very desirous of aiding the “other sheep” and have not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">waited</span><span class="font4"> for the opportunity to “preach the word” but have made, looked for, gone out and found the opportunity. Wherever they may be the main topic for discussion is the Kingdom, whether on the bus, on the streetcar, or with friends or relatives. With them the opportune place and time to preach is anywhere and anytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So with this outstanding service year of 1950 having come to its end we now anxiously look forward to the next year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The few brethren that we have in Syria have during the past year been doing commendable work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following is an experience of a young man 20 years old who had a knowledge of the truth but was drafted into army service by the Syrian government. While there he became sick and had to stay in the military hospital for a few days. Being enthused about the truth he began to preach the Word to all the patients and nurses. They were all so Interested that they even crowded around his bed, making a small meeting to listen to him speak about the blessings of the new world. A Catholic nurse went and told the hospital director, who was at the same time a Mohammedan captain, about this person propagating such strange teachings. The captain came to him and angrily shouted that he was “preaching about Jehovah the God of the Jews” here among soldier patients. But the brother fearlessly and intelligently began to explain to him the meaning of the name Jehovah and the Kingdom message and the salvation that will come to all persons of good will. This illuminating testimony readily put the captain on the receptive side and after a while he took the Greek Scriptures from this new brother to read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day the captain called this new publisher into his office, where he asked fully about this new message. This brother seized the opportunity and began to explain in greater detail the Kingdom message, God’s Word and purpose. When the brother had finished, the captain stood up and extended his hand to him, saying, “I congratulate you, my son, for your wonderful knowledge and fearlessness, but be careful not to cause any disturbance in the camp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the soldiers asked him where he got his knowledge, especially since being so young. He told them it was all from the Bible and they too can obtain it by studying their Bibles. One good-will Catholic soldier who had never seen a Bible up till then was willing to sacrifice his two months’ wages in order to get one. He finally obtained one, began to study it diligently and ask many intelligent questions. One day he was put in jail because he refused to call his captain his master, saying he had only one master and that was Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This young brother now has a Bible study with 6 soldiers, but because the captain does not allow them to meet in the camp they go outside to the fields, where they gladly study the Society’s publications. It is not unusual in Syria to see soldiers in uniform in attendance at our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Damascus, that famous old city rich in Biblical and secular history, today lias a large population of many thousands with the majority belonging to the Moslem religion. Scattered all over the city are many mosques, with their studded prayer towers jutting out here and there. Today in this city we have a small company of Christian witnesses. There appear to be many people of good will In this city, because in a few hours' witnessing many books can be placed. Witnessing in some parts of this city of antiquity takes us right back in time as though we were living in the days of the apostles. It has narrow cobblestone streets and high walls made out of clay mixed with straw. The publisher knocks on the door, then to be invited Inside the enclosure to find a water fountain or a small garden with flowers and the like. The Arabs are great people to sit and talk. Usually everyone in the family will come out and listen, thus almost always the witness will be speaking to three or four persons or more.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Another joyful and blessed service year has ended for the land of Mexico. The organization enjoyed a 20 per cent increase in number of publishers. It is a pleasure to observe just how the work is expanding in that land and how new territories are being reached with the preaching of the Word. People are pleased to hear the truth, because it is so different from what they have been taught for centuries by the Catholic organization. The truth is appealing; it brings joy and satisfaction; it shows them the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some places the brethren have been arrested. In one locality a mayor declared that what Jehovah’s witnesses were preaching was seditious. Twenty-one of the Lord’s people were thrown into prison, and it took some months before they could be released. Finally, after appealing the ease to a higher court, the Lord’s people won the decision. It was shown they were not seditious, but sincere in their belief, and that they had a right to express themselves. The branch servant tells us in his report of some experiences they are having in Mexico, and some of the stories he relates are very cheering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past service year an effort was made to carry the witness work to some of the many unworked cities in our large Mexican territory, which has over 25 million people in it. There were state and territory capitals, as in the Yucatan peninsula and in some of our west coast states that have never even heard of the truth; but in 1949, twelve Mexican special pioneers were moved into these absolute virgin territories, cities averaging from 30,000 population to over 150,000 people. Most of these cities, according to rumor, would be quite difficult to work, since they were Catholic, and since the people were not accustomed to having Jehovah’s witnesses knock on their doors every few months as in Mexico City, where more than 800 publishers work this city of about three million people. But as is the usual case these rumors turned out false. In the past nine months that these special pioneers have been working the states bordering Guatemala, British Honduras and the west coast they have placed a total of 11,717 pieces of literature and they averaged 10 studies each. Soon there should be companies in these places that up until a year ago had never even heard of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Usually the Mexican year report mentions how tough it is on the circuit servants and others who at times travel for days on burros, mules or horses, sleep out and really rough it, sometimes in the tropics and other times on the high and cold central plateau, bordered by mountains, and how the bugs and mosquitoes make it very miserable for these traveling representatives of the Society. But that isn’t always the case. Even though in many places our methods of traveling are quite primitive, yet in other places we use the most modern methods of traveling in the witness work. For example, in the northern part of Mexico, in the cotton country, there is a Mexican publisher that owns a couple of airplanes; one he uses for crop fumigation and the other as a trainer plane. Recently he sent in some of his experiences, and the following one he had last April, showing how he uses his planes to further the Kingdom interests:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On one occasion I went to visit some friends of mine at their ranch. I had to go by plane, since there was no other means of getting to the ranch. After getting there I circled around the ranch a few times looking for a place to land. Near the house of my friends was a very narrow road and, since there wasn’t anything better to use, thanks to Jehovah, I landed safely. They were very glad to see me, and after greeting me they invited me into their home. We started a conversation, and before long I was giving them a witness. They did not resist at all, but, to the contrary, showed much interest. The father of the family knew a little about the Bible, but he did not belong to any particular sect. He would tell them that everything that I was saying was correct because that is the way it was written. After seeing how deeply interested they were I placed three </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> books and offered to study with them weekly. They accepted the offer and said that they would be waiting for me the following Sunday morning at eight o’clock. They also stated that I wouldn’t have to worry about landing, since they would fix a small landing field by the time I got there the following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I returned the next week, and, sure enough, they had fixed a small but good landing field on which I landed without any trouble. After greeting them we entered their home and immediately started to study. They all rejoiced at the study and asked me not to miss a single study with them, because they were all very much interested. I went to all of the following studies and, since Memorial was coming up, I invited them to attend, an invitation which they all accepted. I told them to get ready and to be prepared to leave on Memorial day, since I would pick them up in my plane. On Memorial day I went for them and there they were all anxiously waiting for me because they wanted to meet the rest of the brethren and see the Kingdom Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another interesting item is this report from the wife of a circuit servant: “After Brother Knorr’s visit last December, my husband was assigned as circuit servant in Mexico City and in surrounding </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pueblos,</span><span class="font4"> or small towns. Among the many interesting experiences we have had in the last seven months since we started the circuit work was in the small town of Almoloya, Hidalgo, about three hours’ ride by train from Mexico City and two hours more of walking to the small </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rancho</span><span class="font4"> where the Kingdom Hall Is located. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rancho</span><span class="font4"> is on a high plateau with surrounding mountains in the distance, including the beautiful snow-capped volcano Popocatepetl. Here is the land of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">maguey s</span><span class="font4"> or cactus plant from which the drink of the Indians called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pulque</span><span class="font4"> is extracted, a milky substance which is intoxicating if overindulged in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There are 9 publishers in this company and their territory is very scattered, and back-calls are sometimes many hours away by foot or horseback. Two days were spent in making back-calls, and these we reached by horseback; that is, everyone except my husband, who rode a burro. Living up to its reputation of stubbornness, it absolutely refused to cross every bridge that we came to, but after hitting it and dismounting and literally pushing it, we finally reached our destination. We greatly enjoyed our stay with these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In another company we visited there is just one brother and his wife who are Kingdom publishers, and the priest of the town did everything possible to force him to leave. This brother was called before the local </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">juez,</span><span class="font4"> or judge, he being the only official of the town, as it is a construction camp. The brother explained our work and gave a good witness. The judge said if the brother could prove to him that the name Jehovah is found in the Catholic Bible, it would be all right with him if he continued his preaching work there. He suggested they go to the Catholic church and look in the Catholic Bible. There the judge requested the priest to bring the Bible. He did so but very reluctantly. The brother opened to Psalm 82:19 and after one glance the judge said, ‘That’s enough for me,’ and turning to the priest, said, ‘This man is all right and he should have as much liberty to preach as you have, and if I hear of you or any of your people molesting him anymore, you will have to leave town and not him.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are planning to start our new service year with four district assemblies which we hope will reflect in a small way the joy, knowledge and theocratic spirit of the great Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York city.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As one approaches the shore of The Netherlands from the sea, he is impressed with the neat, orderly arrangement of things. The windmills, the dikes, the canals, the numerous water craft, are all just like the descriptions in the books and in tourist advertisements. It is an interesting country. But for Jehovah’s witnesses there is a greater interest than just the scenery, and that is in promoting the true worship of Jehovah. The brethren have been faithfully planting and watering, and Jehovah, true to his promise, has given the increase. The brethren in The Netherlands have followed organization counsel in every way, knowing that to follow the lead of the “faithful and wise servant” brings results. The brethren in The Netherlands have had good results, and all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> readers will enjoy the interesting experiences from the past year as related by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Institution of Magazine Day meant a greater distribution of magazines, and this in turn meant greater preparations had to be made in connection with that feature of service. So steps were taken to supply the brethren with magazine bags as a means of making the street work more effective. With postwar conditions improving continually, we were able to procure the materials for making bags, which was done at the branch home. Often travelers from all parts of the earth approach the witnesses on the street and remark about the unity of Jehovah’s witnesses, and how they see the same sight wherever they go, street publishers with their neat, clean bags presenting the same magazine with the same zest and vigor, which gives opportunity for giving a good witness to the Kingdom. A notable increase in the placement of magazines is the result of this feature of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of this planting and sowing was not without result. The Memorial saw an attendance of 6,640, many of these now being publishers of the Kingdom. 222 took the important forward step by symbolizing their consecration by immersion. There were six new publisher peaks throughout the service year, the latest, 5,716 in July, is very gladdening. The 14 per cent increase in average number of publishers shows that this little low country too had the Word preached in it. An average of 200 pioneers served in the field, with a peak of 232 in August, when they were joined temporarily by an enthusiastic group of 43 vacation pioneers who may soon be permanently in the full-time ranks. To expedite the work it was found necessary to organize 10 new companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many were the joys and experiences of the brethren while making such profitable use of their time. A report from a publisher shows how religious pastures are being seared while Theocracy increases. ‘‘A minister of a small Baptist congregation .. . promised 25 guilders to everyone who could prove from the Bible that God’s name is Jehovah. . . . One of his ‘flock’ . . . asked a publisher on the street if the name Jehovah was in the Bible. The sister gave an answer and then arranged for a back-call, inviting the company servant to come along. The householder called in her entire family, all being Baptists, and we had an enjoyable evening talking about many doctrines of the Bible. Arrangements were made for another call next week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report continues, telling how the next week, just as the back-call was to commence, two ministers, of the Baptist and Dutch Reformed denominations, entered, who, after a rousing session, were completely routed, evacuating under a barrage of excuses and apologies. The back-call continued. Later an elder of the church decided to make the last stand alone, so let the publisher tell the conclusion of the matter. “It did not take long before he cried out, ‘You are of the Devil.’ Then one member of the family rose up and said, ‘I demand that all devils leave the house immediately.’ The elder and four others left the room. The result of all this is that already ten of these ex-Baptists are active publishers, and ten per cent of them are in the full-time service. Others are about to enter the service soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Defending and legally establishing the good news in The Netherlands has resulted in telling victories and at the same time expanding the preaching of the Word to the courts of the land. In our report on the previous service year we mentioned the Eindhoven case. This case is scheduled to come before the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hoge Raad der Nederlanden</span><span class="font4"> (Supreme Court of The Netherlands) in September of this year. About one hundred witnesses are involved. After preliminary investigations, five of them were acquitted by the lower court when the five policemen who had arrested the witnesses had to confess that they had not personally seen the “transgressions” which they reported as “facts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other cases involving “Blue Laws”, street witnessing, public lectures in the open air and in private homes, have been decided in our favor. In the city of Gouda, a few brethren were arrested when preaching from house to house on Sunday morning. The judge ruled that the law was made to give shopkeepers and the like the opportunity to have a weekly day of rest and that it can be applied only to those who engage in this work for pecuniary reasons. The defendants did nothing else than distribute, either for payment or free, printed matter which contained their “religious conviction”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Sittard one of the brethren was charged with advertising on the public street without a license. The court held that “advertising on the public street refers to recommending something that a person wants to sell or otherwise seek pecuniary gain. However, the recommending of a doctrine, of principles, or generally of something in which there is an ideology cannot be classified under advertising but is rather called propaganda. There is no evidence that the defendant made any pecuniary gain, . . . rather that he was trying to preach the gospel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Theocracy’s increase is just as much a reality here as elsewhere. The spirit of the international convention in New York has imbued the brethren here with much zeal, and will prove to be a real stimulus for the work In the new year. The Netherlands contributed to the international touch on Graduation Day with three Dutch brethren graduating. A small delegation along with 8 students for the IGth class were also in attendance. We now move forward confidently into the new service year, anticipating even yet richer and fuller opportunities of praise. We rejoice in Jehovah that we have been called to this wonderful life of praise and pray that we may ever ‘live up to his name’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In order to better take care of the work in the Netherlands West Indies, a branch was established here in the past year on the island of Curasao, in the city of Willemstad. Special attention was given to the possessions of The Netherlands known as the West Indies, and good progress has been made. The effects of the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly were also felt in these islands because a number of brethren attended the convention in New York and then returned with all the new releases and the enthusiasm that was so manifest at the convention. The missionaries from Gilead have done splendid work, and it is good to see a new peak of 121 publishers working in these islands. The branch servant gives us a few high lights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To begin with, in September we received official notice that the president of the Society would give us a visit in January. This had long been looked forward to by the missionaries and company publishers and, now that it was to be realized, we set about preparing for it with great anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We found the owners and officials of halls for public lectures most co-operative, so we were able to obtain among the best places available in both Aruba and Curasao for the public lecture by Brother Knorr. These lectures were very effective in bringing about the 39 per cent increase in number of publishers which we realized for the year. While here Brother Knorr authorized the renting of a new missionary home and Kingdom Hall in Curasao and, by the Lord’s grace, we were able to obtain a large place right down in the center of town. This has done much to help the attendance at the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One thing that we enjoy very much here is having brothers and people of good will who are sailors visit us while their ship is in port. The city of Willemstad has a very busy harbor and ships from many countries come here to bring cargo and take oil; so we have had visits from brethren from many parts of the world and they have given us many interesting experiences which have been a stimulation to the brethren here. Now with our Kingdom Hall downtown it is very easy to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As time goes on it is gratifying to see the truth spreading into new places. I have in mind the Dutch islands of Saba, St. Eustatia and St. Martin, which are about 500 miles northeast of here. These places were visited by the Society’s boat “Sibia”. Many people here in Curacao tell us of their friends and relatives in the Windward Islands that have become Interested in the truth as a result of the visit of the brethren on the “Sibia”. Also on the island of Bonaire progress is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the past year we have had very little opposition to the work here in this territory. Every now and then a local paper published by the Catholic organization will register a complaint. One of such, which was rather amusing, went on to say that Jehovah’s witnesses are working very hard (a compliment) to spread their doctrines and ‘if the children should come home with any of their publications, take them away from the children at once, as they are dangerous for the children to read’. Continuing their warning to the parents, the paper told them ‘when they had taken the literature away from the children not to read it themselves, as it is not good for them either’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another point of interest here is to see the good effect the truth has on the moral lives of those that come to a knowledge of it and take it seriously. One case here is where a person came to a knowledge of the truth and wanted to symbolize her consecration by water immersion. So, when the man with whom she had been living for 17 years refused to take the trouble to legalize their marriage she left him and was immersed. She is now a very active and happy Kingdom publisher. Of course, there are others that after getting a knowledge of the truth do not value it highly enough, so they drop back into the mire like the sow that was washed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Naturally the climax of the service year was the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York city. Four local publishers and two missionaries were able to attend from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the missionaries were away the company reached a new peak of publishers, which shows a good spirit among the local brethren and that they are growing strong in the Lord. Also to the surprise of the missionaries when they returned they found that the company had installed a big electric fan in the Kingdom Hall at an expense of $80. This is proving a help in having good attendance at the meetings, as it is very warm here in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are ever mindful of the liberty we enjoy in Jehovah’s work, and now even more so because of the fact that within the last week three local newspapers in Curasao have published reports of the banning of our work by the Communist government in East Germany, while the fourth local paper (Catholic) has carried a report of the ban Imposed by the government in the Dominican Republic, which is very close to us here. So in view of these things we are most thankful for the freedom we enjoy and we will always use it to make known the name and majesty of Jehovah, the Most High God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures state, “Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea.” Islands in the sea are beautiful to behold, and they are places of refuge and safety from the storms of the ocean. But the true praises that ascend to the enthroned King, Christ Jesus, and to Jehovah God, the Father, are the praises from the witnesses of God on these islands. Newfoundland is the tenth-largest island in the world, and many of the publishers who reside at this place do work similar to that of the disciples, who were fishermen. They travel many places by ship, even as Paul did. The brethren in Newfoundland are anxious to preach the Word and are doing splendidly even though they are widely scattered throughout the little villages along the seacoast. A minister cannot just board a subway or a trolley car or bus and get to his territory. These publishers have to walk many, many miles to get to their next house. It is interesting to read of their experiences. The branch servant has recorded a few of them in his annual report, and some are recorded here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much hope for the people is spread in Newfoundland by the two Gilead School graduates operating the Society’s floating missionary home, the motor vessel “Hope”. During the months from June to November this boat brings these missionaries within reach of their congregations. A schedule is fixed whereby each settlement in a selected area of the coast is visited each two weeks, and in this way regular studies are arranged. The clergy have stirred up much opposition in the sections covered, but this has served to advertise our work even further. Many are coming out as witnesses for Jehovah in these isolated sections of Newfoundland and two of these have taken up the full-time pioneer ministry. The coast of Newfoundland is a stormy one and the boat's crew have the elements to fight as well as religious opposition. On one occasion this year during a pitch-dark night the boat was driven ashore in a storm. Luckily it grounded on a sandy beach instead of the usual rocky shore. When the storm subsided the boat lay on its side high and dry on the beach, where it had to remain for over a week until the tide rose enough to float it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the winter months the circuit servant visited some of the interested persons that had been found by the crew of the “Hope”. Reporting on the interest, he wrote in to the oflice: “All the people of good will talk very highly of the Hope and its crew and are looking for it to push its way into their harbors again with more hope for them. They loved to sit and tell me of experiences the missionaries had and had told them and about the many times the Hope would battle the waves to reach them, and about the many hours its crew would sit and read and explain the Bible to them These people here are genuinely for God’s kingdom and, though I have many miles (about 22) to walk to a railroad tomorrow, I’m leaving this harbor very much encouraged and certain of the Lord’s blessing on the Hope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On one occasion this last spring, the circuit servant hired a man to take him across An arm of the ocean in a small rowboat. When they were out in dangerous waters the boat was found to be leaking faster than it could be bailed out. Fortunately, chunks of ice were floating in the area, so they were able to row from pan to pan, jump out of the boat and pull it up on the ice, empty the water out, and proceed on to the next pan of ice until finally they reached the safety of the other shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps the most outstanding event in the lives of the Newfoundland brethren during 1950 did not even occur in this island territory, but, instead, in New York city. For months before July 30 publishers began to make preparations to attend the great international convention. Many worked many extra hours in secular work, some cut down on their groceries, some sold their fishing boats—they were determined to go to this assembly of God’s people. It was far from easy for these people with very limited funds to make such a trip, and many, many sacrifices were made. The opening day of the convention at New York, however, found over seventy representatives from this island in attendance, a number which represents nearly half of the average number of publishers. The mixed feelings of joyful emotion plainly visible on the faces of these brethren, most of whom had never seen more than one hundred brethren together at one time at our small circuit assemblies, bespoke the inward thrills they were experiencing as they gazed around the spacious Yankee Stadium filled with their brethren from over sixty other lands and saw the graduation of the fifteenth class of Gilead. This class included two sisters from their own island of Newfoundland. How richly Jehovah had repaid them for the extra effort it took to come to New York!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As this service year ends, it finds Jehovah’s people in Newfoundland greatly strengthened and, armed with the new theocratic instruments released at the international convention, they enter the new service year with determination that, come what may, they will continue to “preach tlie word” that theocratic expansion in Newfoundland may continue until every one of the Lord’s “other sheep” in this isle of the sea is found.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers in New Zealand have real cause for rejoicing, because they have reached another all-time peak in persons serving the interests of the Kingdom. Knowing that this is the time for Theocracy’s increase, they have put forth a strenuous effort during the past year in preaching the Word. Certainly the Lord has blessed their efforts. The work has moved along smoothly in these islands in the South Pacific. There are no really outstanding problems. All of the publishers there have followed closely the advice given by the Society in the way of organizing the work, and the Lord’s blessing has been upon their efforts. The branch servant had the privilege of attending the assembly in New York, and following his return made this interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Contributing to the expansion in New Zealand is the wise counsel on theocratic organization received from the governing body, all of which we value and gladly observe. Thus, twelve circuit assemblies were held during the year and the practical instructions given were keenly appreciated by all publishers. In addition, a special assembly was arranged for the Maori brethren. This was a joyful occasion, marked by the opening of the newly built Kingdom Hall at Waima. European and Maori brethren to the number of 300 attended from far and near and many strangers of the Maori race were present at the public lecture, swelling the attendance to 400. The program included Interesting and instructive talks both in the English and in the Maori language. The new Kingdom Hall is a landmark in the district and is a credit to the enterprise and industry of the Maori brethren Much of the timber used in the construction of the hall was cut from logs felled on their own land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One interested Catholic who was studying the Kingdom message asked her priest to obtain for her a Catholic Bible. Why, sure, he would get her a Bible I But weeks passed and the Bible did not materialize. Much disappointed, the lady mentioned her desire for a Bible to a friend who was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and quickly she was supplied with a Douay Bible all properly signed and authorized by the approved Catholic prelates. Proudly she carried her prize to the Catholic priest to be blessed. Taking the book from her, he asked sharply, ‘Where did you get that Bible?’ In reply she reminded him that he had promised to get her a Bible and had not done so, and now she had obtained a copy from one of Jehovah’s witnesses. For some moments the priest held the Bible, examining its authenticity, then handed it back to her without comment. ‘Aren’t you going to bless it, Father?’ she cried. ‘No,’ he replied curtly, and walked away. This lady then sought out her Jehovah’s witness friend and was soon convinced of the worthlessness of priestly blessings. She has now taken a firm stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many parents, as they endeavor to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, are sometimes discouraged at the lack of interest manifested by their offspring. But youth at home, seemingly careless of the truth, will not necessarily remain so when their environment is changed. One such, well instructed by parents in England, arrived in New Zealand, where he became friendly with a New Zealand boy who had studied higher criticism. After combating his friend’s arguments the best he could with his limited knowledge of the truth, they together decided to seek out the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses for further aid. Soon a Bible study was arranged and the two young men proved to be hungry for the truth. Before long the doubts fostered by higher criticism were swept away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another publisher tells of the businessman who called at the house where he was witnessing, and after listening for a while he joined in the conversation. He was a chemist, sick at heart at the world outlook, had attended an atomic research conference in the United States and knew the danger to mankind of the atomic weapons. He had met Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada and hoped to meet some in New Zealand. He was pleased to attend the local company meetings and later obtained lodgings with one of the publishers. His staying with those “terrible Jehovah’s witnesses” displeased one of his clients, but he replied that if ever he became good enough he would count it a privilege to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses himself. He was previously a Roman Catholic and his main concern is whether Jehovah will forgive him for his part in the war. No doubt he will be comforted as he learns the truth about the mercy and longsuffering of Jehovah through his Son Christ Jesus, making it possible for all who serve him to receive his favor and blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At New Plymouth there are a number of young people in the local company and five of these decided to try for pioneer hours during the August J4-day school vacation. August is a winter month in New Zealand, the longer summer holidays being taken during December, January and February. These young people worked well during their vacation and also witnessed after school hours and at week ends during the month. The result was that they each turned in a report for August averaging 105 hours. We have great hopes that these zealous young people will follow the example of other vacation pioneers and enter the regular pioneer service after their school days have ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This report would not be complete without some reference to the high point of the year, Theocracy’s increase convention in New York, at which thirty New Zealanders, including the branch servant, were privileged to be present. Even though we live on the opposite side of the globe the convention in prospect was viewed with keen anticipation by all whether intending to be present at New York or not. Now that the brethren are returning from New York we are beginning to realize in some measure the blessings of that great feast. Without a doubt, the joys of Theocracy’s Increase convention were a foretaste of the joyous feast of ingathering now being experienced by Jehovah’s people in every land. In New Zealand we look forward to continued expansion. We have every reason for confidence. We have already passed the 1,200-publisher mark and, considering that our Memorial attendance exceeded 1,500, we know that, by Jehovah’s grace, still more of the Lord’s “other sheep” will yet take their stand for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Much is said in the world today about the iron curtain that envelopes Russia and her satellites. Very little is said about the totalitarian principles used by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in a curtain around her people to hold them in ignorance. This curtain, however, can be pierced by the word of truth; and in Nicaragua the missionaries, along with company publishers and pioneers now associated with them, are preaching the truth. For 450 years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had undisputed control of the people and has filled them with the doctrines of purgatory, eternal torment and trinity. Now they are disturbed because Jehovah’s witnesses come along with the Bible, even the Catholic Bible, which removes the veil from the eyes of the people. The branch servant in Nicaragua sends us some interesting happenings of the year which you will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year, seeing the Hierarchy’s insistence on the false teaching of “eternal torment” and that of the trinity, and because of a campaign by Protestants to “expose” the teaching of Jehovah’s witnesses on these matters, it was determined to give great publicity to two public lectures: “Is There Fire in Hell?” and “The Creator: One God or Three?” With excellent advertising, tn which the publishers entered with gusto, the two meetings were held in one of the principal theaters of the capital city, with a large attendance. Now hell is no longer hot in the minds of the people, but the Hierarchy certainly are several degrees nearer their picture of it, under their back-buttoned collars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholic </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hoja Dominical</span><span class="font4"> of the following week called attention to these lectures and threatened excommunication to any Catholic who would rent a building to us for any purpose. The owners of one chain of theaters were cowed by this bluff, but another courageous man now offers us his theater free for public meetings. Another result has been greater use of the parks, with greater public notice of Jehovah’s witnesses. The two lectures were also given in the principal cities of the departments, with good attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Catholic pressure also fomented resentment to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">article on “Managua, Nicaragua, A Heavenly Spot?” and a regular landslide of newspaper articles were written condemning the article and Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of the local publishers answered, and two excellent letters were printed. A few persons hold resentment yet against </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">but a great many have had their interest awakened by the newspaper publicity, and the campaign for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions that month, October, brought the best results of any </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign to date. Distributors’ copies placed also went up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meetings which the Nicaraguan brethren remember most keenly, however, were held during the visit of Brothers Morgan and Knorr in December. The speech “Liberty to the Captives”, with Its thrilling expose of the Inquisition, caused much comment. The most intensive advertising to date, using six large banners hung over the streets, and 50,000 handbills, as well as information and store cards, brought the largest attendance ever to hear a lecture In Managua. Brother Knorr’s visit Is remembered especially for his counsel to the brethren on “Preach the Word”, and his arrangement for the opening of another missionary home in Jinotepe, a small city in the highlands. Four missionaries were sent to this home, opened In February. The great blessings these brethren have had In their work show that the Lord used Brother Knorr to open up the work In this section which has many hungry sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diligent work in this new area did not long escape notice. A person of good will reports that shortly after the work was begun there plans were being made in a local meeting to run Jehovah’s witnesses out of Carazo. One courageous man protested. “There is freedom of worship in Nicaragua; there should be no discrimination. If we run out Jehovah’s witnesses we must run out the Baptists and Catholics also.” (Several times during the year efforts have been made to have this provision of freedom of worship stricken from the Nicaraguan Constitution.) The spiritual famine has been broken In Carazo Department for men of good will such as he; before five months had passed over 100 Bible studies were being carried on in their homes, and ten persons had seen their privilege of telling yet others of the fine provision of spiritual truths on which they had fattened. As expected, opposition has grown : the Baptist preacher, finding a missionary conducting a study with some members of his church, screeched “These are my people!” Many of “his people” are now strong enough to break away from his famine-stricken prison house. The preacher himself continues in his active opposition to the work, although he admitted privately to one of Jehovah’s witnesses that he now doubts the very doctrines he preaches. His own words will be his judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Near the close of the year a trip was made to the goldmining town of Siuna. Two missionaries had visited this town in 1947 and placed many books. From one obtainer the branch received this letter: “Sometime ago I received some of your wonderful books from one of the lady members of your organization that passed through this mine. It was understood that I was to read those books and report the one I enjoyed most and decide whether I would become a member of your Society. I enjoyed the one entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> the most, and I want to become a member.” She could! The branch servant visited this sister and gave her instructions as to service and how to gather the interested ones for study, and the latest report shows more than pioneer hours in her third month of service. It does the heart good to read her letters about the interest she finds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Nicaragua rejoice in the privilege that is theirs, to “preach the word” to this nation in the few short remaining years. Poor though they may be, on each face will be found the joyful Kingdom smile, indicating that they do have the blessing of Jehovah that makes rich. Such joy, such enthusiasm, is infectious. Many hundreds must yet join with them in the preaching, and they are coming.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">World distress not only afflicts the so-called “civilized” nations, but discontent, despair, bloodshed and the inharmony of men can also be found in Africa. This, of course, is all due to the sin that entered the world through the disobedience of one man. There is great need for the preaching of the gospel in this territory to turn the minds of the people to Christ Jesus and to God. Jehovah’s witnesses in the land of Nigeria are putting forth a strenuous effort to help the people of that country to learn the truth, and many are turning a hearing ear toward it, hearkening to the Word and believing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A report of what has been done during the past year has been sent in by the branch servant. The office of the Society in Nigeria is located at Lagos, and this office also looks after the work in Cameroun, Dahomey, Fernando Po and Togo. Reports are also published on these places, but it might be added that a ban has been placed on the work in the French possessions to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from spreading the message of the Kingdom. This matter has been taken up with the officials, but we have had no success as yet in having the ban lifted. The matter has now come to the attention of the officials in Paris who care for the interests of the colonial possessions, and it is hoped that someday these governmental officials will see that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a good educational work among the people, teaching them how to live properly. The reports follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great work has been accomplished through the holding of circuit and district assemblies country-wide. An assembly In Nigeria Is a delightful experience. The setting or environment has a character all its own, for almost all assemblies are held in booths constructed of bamboos and palm branches, often surrounded by graceful palms, banana plants and rich vegetation. In some parts of the country the brethren wear native costumes of the most gorgeous colors and the gathering takes on the appearance of a beautiful bed of flowers. At times public meeting attendances reach staggering figures, for an entire town will turn out to hear a lecture. At the Obiaruku assembly the brethren numbered only about 300, while the public meeting attendance was 4,620. In one town a native king, who had previously oppressed and persecuted the brethren, was deposed and run out of town by the enraged populace because of his corrupt rule. When the brethren came together for a circuit assembly the chiefs handed over the vacated palace which was used, not only for the assembly sessions, but also to house many of the visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The huge Mohammedan population, numbering considerably more than ten million, continues dead and unresponsive to the truth, but in one part of the country It Is gratifying to note that a few are taking their stand. Several came forward at a recent circuit assembly and a prominent chief was immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Interested persons are often confronted with many problems and difficulties. Religion, both pagan and “Christian”, holds the people in a vicelike grip. There are many pagan cults and secret societies that prosecute a reign of terror over the simple villagers. Whole towns are completely controlled by a hierarchy of juju priests that keep the people in fear and ignorance and milk them of their hard-earned money. Embracing the truth, a person is liable to be deprived of all his belongings and even physically assailed, if not killed. But despite these difficulties the people of good will continue to take their stand everywhere and the pastures of religion are becoming ever leaner and more desolate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the eastern provinces the greatest hindrance is the spirit of radical nationalism that keeps the population in a political ferment. Coupled with this movement is the new national religion, the worship of the “God of Africa” that regards the Bible as an “imperialist” book. The region is also very Catholic and is overrun by swarms of “white fathers” as well as representatives of all the principal sects and cults of Christendom. But still the increase continues. In the city of Aba, the very heart of radical nationalism and the scene of ugly riots and looting after the Enugu shootings, the publishers have increased from 165 at the time of the riots to 224 In August. The “evil servant” class have also been very active and have thrown in their lot with the “God of Africa” doctrine and are now proclaiming that Jehovah is the God of Africa and that Jesus and the prophets were black-skinned Africans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We started printing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in the Twl language during the year for our Gold Coast brethren, bringing the number of vernacular magazines printed here up to three. We are glad to be able to help our neighboring branch in this way. Much effort has been expended in the campaign to eradicate Illiteracy from among the brethren, and good progress has been made, particularly in the English classes. There is a very keen desire to learn English, far more than is the case with the native languages. More than 2,000 illiterate brethren and people of good will are attending the classes and already some are able to read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font4">and other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been much increase in the capital, a peak of 550 publishers In six units being reached by the end of the service year. In addition, there are 36 pioneers. There is hardly a street in Lagos where the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” is not almost a byword.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">About the middle of the service year the Cameroun government openly identified itself along with other opposing governments of the world, issuing its “Decision No. 594 du 16 de fdvrier, 1950”. This decision prohibited the ‘introduction, circulation, distribution, dispatch or sale’ of all Watchtower publications listed in the schedule. The schedule names twelve of our publications in French, nineteen in English, eight in Yoruba and three In Arabic. Then comes the final clause prohibiting everything in the Cameroun vernacular. It was felt that there was almost certain to be some pressure from the authorities at least in the early days of the ban. Nothing very much resulted, and it was not long before the brethren were able to carry on much the same as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A more serious menace to the work has resulted from the “evil servant” who seized upon this new situation to further ‘smite their fellow servants’. One who had long been in the truth and who had stumbled over certain Scriptural truths has become the ringleader and by “good words and fair speeches” attempts to deceive the hearts of the simple. A concerted effort was made to seize control of the company in Douala and oust the appointed servants, but the faithful brethren stood their ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">House-to-house work generally must be done with the Bible alone, but the people of good will are always ready for the literature on return visits. There are some “hot” districts where the local Catholics in conjunction with the police spy on and shadow the brethren and even make it impossible for them to carry Bibles, but the work continues in these places nonetheless.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Like many of their brethren in other lands, the brethren in Dahomey have labored under an official ban throughout the year. But this has not dampened their zeal and toward the closing months spectacular increases have been in evidence. Throughout the year Interested persons have been fed through the medium of back-calls and home Bible studies, resulting in a splendid peak of publishers in July of 290.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Generally the brethren are able to preach with their Bibles, but in some places they have become so well known and the district is so intensely Catholic, that it is not pos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">sible to do even that without danger of arrest In some cases the houses of the brethren are watched and the brethren themselves are shadowed as they move around the district. Some of the native chiefs have thrown in their lot with the Catholics in conspiring against the brethren, and in one instance an opposing chief made arrangements with the French district commandant for the arrest of a whole company. Police arrived early in the morning while the company were studying the daily text. They were arrested, tied with ropes and led before the French officer. However, nothing further was done, and after being kept in custody for a little while they were released with a strong warning not to preach or even meet together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many people of good will in Dahomey. They are tired of the empty husks of the Catholic religion and no longer relish the pagan diet of purgatory, hell-flre, priestly pardons and penance. They are ravenous for the nourishing food of God’s Word, and the brethren in Dahomey are determined that they shall have it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>FERNANDO PO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Very little has ever been done in the Atlantic islands of Spanish Guinea, of which Fernando Po is the largest and most important. It being under Spanish control, the Catholic church Is well and firmly established and is fattening itself at the expense of the “sheep”. Many Nigerians are on the Island working the plantations under the direction of a British firm by agreement with the Nigerian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year a pioneer from Cameroun and, later, a pioneer from Nigeria succeeded in getting onto the island. There is now a small company in Santa Isabel, the capital.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>TOGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After the Dahomey authorities banned the work of Kingdom-preaching by government decree, the neighboring government of Togo under French mandate threw in their lot as fellow opposers and closed their doors to the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer has established himself as a small trader to realize a living and for the month of August was able to report 100 hours in his new territory. Many people of good will have been found—one educated man, having already been immersed, is even talking about being a pioneer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The branch office located in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, looks after the territory of the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, as well as the work being done in Northern Rhodesia. One of the outstanding things about the work in Northern Rhodesia is the very large number of individuals associated with the work. It runs to about 40,000. Of course, these are not all publishers. They need a great deal of education and training, as many of them are illiterate. However, they prefer to associate themselves with the Lord’s organization and hearken to His word. In a number of the territories that operate under the office at Lusaka, it will be observed that the opposition comes through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This is especially true in the Belgian Congo, where the religionists have great influence with government officials, and this retards the expansion of theocratic activity. In all of this territory there is a tremendous amount of work yet to be done, and we feel that the Lord will open the field up soon. The only thing we can do is keep on trying, and, by the Lord’s grace, this will be done. The branch servant wrote the following report from Lusaka on the countries mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase specially aimed at during the year was in the ability of the African brethren to better ‘preach the Word’, and the accent was put on the need for more personal study by each publisher, the need for all to read and write, and the regular training of the publishers by the mature servants and publishers in the companies. But in addition there has been a real increase in the number of publishers (5.5 per cent), with August seeing a new all-time high of 15,837 in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We got off at the beginning of the year to an encouraging start. For the first time in many years we had </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for free circulation, and when the first issue reached the brethren in the native languages they were overjoyed. By the end of the year we were printing locally close to 5,000 issues in two languages, Ciwemba and Sikololo. Jehovah's servants in this land are Indeed thankful to their heavenly Father that they can now receive the food in due season, and the wonderful articles coming through the columns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> have strengthened the brethren and united them more and more in true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The potential number of publishers here is amazing, with more than 40,000 attending meetings (ratio of 1 to 40 of the population). Many of these would take part in the witness work if permitted, but would be doing so without understanding, and hence not meeting the Scriptural qualification of being ‘apt to teach’. In many parts of the territory the publishers (who now number 1 to 120 of the population) are finding territory for the house-to-house ministry scarce. As a circuit servant reported of one company, “the publishers have covered all their territory . . . only a few villages left where there are one or two people left who do not attend the congregational meetings.” A company in one of the mining camps with an attendance of more than 1,500 at their meetings have only about 6 homes per publisher for territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But many of those who attend meetings have never had a personal Bible study in their homes and perhaps cannot even read. The publishers have been encouraged to give more attention to these and to arrange home Bible studies with them, thus training them to reason about the truth and become equipped to preach it with understanding. Approximately 50 per cent of the publishers can now read, though in the “bush” the percentage is much smaller. Some companies report an almost 100 per cent increase of literates over the past year. At the coming district assemblies a practical method of training illiterates is scheduled for presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Increase has been most marked at the circuit assemblies held during the past year. For instance, one assembly held almost at the same place as one the previous year had 4,600 in attendance at the public meeting, to compare with a former 1,096. Another had 4,349 attending, to compare with 814. These were both assemblies in the “bush”, and almost all those attending had to walk to the meeting place. At one of the above assemblies one of the Gilead missionaries acted as district servant. The circuit was one in an outlying district where no European representative of the Society had visited for over ten years. The local natives would not believe that there were any “white men” associated with Jehovah’s witnesses; when the Gilead graduate got there many of the local population turned out to see the “phenomenon”, and this was probably one reason for the increased attendance. But recent reports show that a number of the curious profited by their curiosity and are now regularly attending the local company’s meetings. It was at this same assembly that the Gilead missionary had the experience of having his interpreter faint when at the climax of the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such crowds flocking to these circuit assemblies have made those of the world wonder. In one district, seeing the many flocking to an assembly, the local villagers commented ‘there will be terrible fights . . . because so many Africans are not easily controllable’. The local chief’s court said they were preparing to handle the “cases”. But when they saw the peaceful assembling of Jehovah’s people and their unity their wonderment increased. Some were heard to exclaim : “Surely these people are more happy than we are; we should attend their meetings next time and learn what gives them such joy.” Later the district servant had an opportunity of explaining to the chief’s counselors the reason for the peaceful conduct of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This increase has not been experienced without opposition. In some areas chiefs have acted high-handedly in burning down some of the grass-built Kingdom Halls. There is good reason to show that behind some of these actions is the influence of religious missionaries. Chiefs when visited have told representatives of the Society that they have been informed by the missionaries that the Watchtower Society is “an evil organization because they respect no one”, and the chief is led to believe that his power will be overthrown by the activity of the publishers. Government officers in the “bush” have very often been just as misinformed as to the nature of our activities; but the few trips made by Gilead graduates to care for circuit assemblies, which resulted in contacting some of these officials, have done quite a bit to clear up our position. An effort was made in the local press to arouse antagonism to the Society by dubbing us with the well-worn “Communist” label. The timely receipt of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font4"> of the international convention with the resolution against communism provided material for a reply which was fully printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrival of four more Gilead missionaries during the year was a great asset to the work. Assigned to work with the European population on the Copperbelt, their service has borne fruit. At the start of the service year there were but 12 publishers associated with the European companies; the last month of the service year saw this number increased to 30. Outstanding was our first European assembly for the territory, a circuit assembly. The peak attendance was 74, at the public talk. This activity has finally squashed the idea in many minds that we were solely a “native” movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The good results of the activities of the graduates of Gilead, especially in the home Bible-study work, though bringing comfort and hope to the people of good will, have aroused the religious shepherds to the realization that their pastures are being invaded. One of the brethren reports the following experience: One minister of religion had been most active in trying to dissuade his flock from accepting the Bible education of Jehovah’s witnesses. Two members of his congregation, with whom the missionary had been conducting a Bible study, decided to call on their minister and get some of their questions cleared up. He refused to answer their questions, saying that they were there to trip him up, and they would tell all over town how they had whipped “the old Dutch Reformed minister into a corner until he couldn’t get out”. Although his wife said she felt he should answer the questions, yet the minister refused. Since these persons were no longer of his church he could not discuss the Scriptures with them. His course of action only served to convince these newly Interested ones that Jehovah’s witnesses were Indeed preaching the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since 1936, when some pioneers visited the country, no organized witnessing has been done in Kenya until this year. In September, 1949, a sister from Britain immigrated with her husband to Nairobi, the capital. Though herself not long a publisher, she was determined to “preach the word” when she got to her new home. Her desire was “to be used of the Lord” wherever she went. As soon as she got settled down she started In with regular witnessing, first to her immediate neighbors and then to those living in the surrounding territory. Her zeal has been blessed and her desire “to be used of the Lord” fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through this sister contact has been made with other Immigrants who have had previous contact with the truth and one of these has associated regularly in the preaching work. It is a real test ot' faith for these isolated ones to keep on steadfastly in Jehovah’s service, unless they keep in mind that Jehovah will ever back them up by his spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With over 30,000 Europeans, almost 100,000 Asiatics and more than 4,000,000 Africans in the territory the field is, to say the least, large. We look to Jehovah to open up the way in his due time for the expanding of the Kingdom message throughout this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>UGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Here again Kingdom witnessing has started up after an interval of 14 years. The last witnessing done was by two pioneers who spent two months in the country in 1936. Then in April of this year a young European couple returned from spending their vacation in England. While there they had taken a stand for the truth and become Kingdom publishers. Though so young in the truth they were determined to continue to preach the Word when they got back to Uganda and tell those of good will what they had learned of Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In June we received their first report of Kingdom activity. The letters they send In to the branch office are full of the ‘joy of the Lord’. The husband’s work takes him about the country somewhat, and wherever he goes the truth goes too! He writes: “We honestly believe that our efforts are being blessed by Jehovah, and we are greatly encouraged to go around planting and watering. . . . We shall shortly be making a visit to Fort Portal, 240 miles away . . . and there again we will endeavor to ‘preach the word’. If it pleases Jehovah, the Kingdom gospel will be preached throughout Uganda.&quot; That is surely the spirit that will receive a rich blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">To Jehovah’s people is the assurance, “no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.” The weapons of misrepresentation, persecution, fines, beatings, imprisonment and deportation have been wielded in the Belgian Congo to try to cut off entirely the ‘preaching of the Word’ in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year the African brethren were continually beset by the police and many of them imprisoned. Due to the ban on the work and letters being censored if going to and coming from anyone suspected of being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, It has been impossible to get a comprehensive picture of what has been happening In the country. The one company which has remained in operation right since the ban had its meetings regularly broken up; midnight searches were made to round up active publishers; those acting as servants were regularly changing as one group was rounded up and other brethren, probably just out of prison themselves, stepped into the breach. Africans from Northern Rhodesia found associating with Jehovah’s witnesses were deported after serving a prison sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the sentences have been of short duration, but some have been sent away to work camps for several years and others imprisoned for long stretches. One brother returned to Northern Rhodesia after having spent almost five years in different prisons in the Congo. During his imprisonment he was whipped on several occasions. At one time lie was told he would never be released unless he was prepared to cease witnessing. Uis experience reminds one of the treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Nazis in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus in the most “out of season” conditions “the word” is being preached in the Belgian Congo. Though out of touch with the Society most of the time, and not able to have the benefits of visits from a circuit servant and other aids to better organization and spiritual health, the brethren are determined to continue in Jehovah’s service. We know that Jehovah will look after his &quot;sheep” in this land and we pray that he will protect them and sustain them in the face of the efforts of the enemy to disrupt their service or lead them astray.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>TANGANYIKA TERRITORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The government of this territory was contacted during the year requesting permission for Gilead graduates to enter the country. It was pointed out that Gilead missionaries were operating in other Central Africa territories. The application was refused, the government stating in its letter that the ‘conditions in Tanganyika were not quite the same as in other African territories’. Recent disturbances in Kenya have, no doubt, had something to do with the government’s attitude. However, it was suggested that we make further application In about a year’s time, and It is hoped that when this is done the result of the Inquiry will be more encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the obstacles which the natives of Tanganyika meet up with when they become interested in the truth is that of polygamy. On this point the circuit servant writes: “The difficulty hindering the work is polygamy. The custom of the people in this territory Is not as elsewhere. Marriage is not very strict, and people like chiefs have as many as 25 wives or more, while the common people have three or four. Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to keep themselves clean from these practices.” At a circuit assembly recently one of the eight immersed was a man who had had five wives betore accepting the truth. On coming to an understanding of the righteous standards of God he set his house in order and followed the Bible requirement of having only one wife. Being a councilor of the chief his course served as a real witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers in this part of the territory are very backward and there is much illiteracy. But they want to serve the Lord and It is hoped that as they learn more of the theocratic organization and the need to be better equipped through personal study, etc., the work will advance. Twenty of the brethren learned to read during the past year and are rejoicing in the enlarged share they can have in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time it has been possible to supply the publishers with a publication in their own language, Swahili. The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font4"> in that language was released during the year and was gladly received by the publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">One of the worst famines ever to strike a country hit Nyasaland during the past year, bringing disease, great suffering and death to the native population. So as the brethren went ahead with preaching the gospel during the first six months of the year it was certainly out of season preaching for them, but they faithfully preached the Word. Due to the drought, supplies of the staple foods of the natives, maize and rice, quickly diminished and the people had to live on roots, bulbs and almost anything they could find or obtain. Many of the population found themselves too weak from starvation to hoe the plants they had set out. It was certainly a sad condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people faced this same plight; but despite their hunger they arranged for talks, especially on the subject “From Scarcity to Plenty”. They pointed the people to the Kingdom as the only hope for the woes of mankind. The branch office at Blantyre, Nyasaland, also looks after the work in Portuguese East Africa, and a report was sent in for both of these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Practically all the preaching work Is done by native brethren to their fellow natives. The European population is growing fast but it is still less than 2 per cent of the total population. There is only one white brother at present and his work is almost entirely among the natives. Basically the work among the small native villages is the same as In the great white cities of the world. The Scriptural examples and instructions to preach from house to house, make back-calls and conduct Bible studies are followed zealously by the brethren. All public meetings are held in the open air, sometimes in shady secluded places where interested people can quietly drink in the truth, other times at busy markets where hundreds congregate and speakers have to use to the full their vocal organs. At one market, however, there is peace for all to hear Jehovah’s witnesses. Last year an area of bushland was cleared for a district assembly and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">misasa</span><span class="font4"> or grass huts were erected. With the assembly finished the people around thought this would make a good market with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">misasa</span><span class="font4"> to he used as places to make and sell drinks. But always on Saturdays Jehovah’s witnesses are there first with a public meeting and the market business never starts until this is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At assembly times witli many brethren attending, large areas of territory are not available for witnessing. All want to share in the advertising, so a problem arises how to arrange for this. It is solved by dividing the brethren Into two or three parties and assigning each party a village or an area. </span><span class="font3">In single line each group tiles olf singing joyiuliy and loudly </span><span class="font4">the Kingdom songs with many extra choruses. People in the fielus or the villages stop their work to see what is happening and brethren peel off from the line to witness to them, later running hard to catch up to the main body. No people have songs like Jehovah’s witnesses, and the very singing of them gives a wonderful witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The branch servant planned an extensive trip round the northern and central provinces early in the service year, but he had barely started when he received the privileged call to Gilead and he hurried back to the branch and from there to America. Now with his course finished, we are hoping to welcome him back shortly. We are very shorthanded at the branch office just now, two brothers working on the translation and production of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Informant</span><span class="font4"> and forms while the other two brethren deal with the ever-increasing number of letters, applications for new companies, literature requirements and everything else connected with a branch of 29 circuits and more than 630 companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a long time our branch quarters have been overcrowded, with insufficient room for the proper housing of the brethren, office or storage space. The housing position is extremely difficult and we have had our ho[&gt;es of a new place dashed several times. We are very well pleased though that we have now’ secured new premises in the form of a modern house with a fine office, and we move in there on September 1. This is undoubtedly going to assist us in our expansion. Part of the present building is being retained for use as storerooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the great advances of the year has been with the production and distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Cinyanja. It was only during 1949 that we began to produce these magazines monthly and since then we have had to double production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured that we will put all of these things to good use to Jehovah’s praise. Our great new peak to close the service year is a herald of the increases ahead during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Two companies close to Inyaminga sent a letter to the branch office asking for more training and assistance to be given them through a special visit of a Nyasaland circuit servant They enclosed money to cover the extra expenses of the train fare. An experienced circuit servant was detailed to make the visit. He was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the brethren and with much interest by the inhabitants of the village to which he was taken. Before he could begin his work he was taken to see the Portuguese administrative officer in charge of the district. This officer read on the brother’s pass that he had arrived for preaching as a minister. He immediately asked if he was a Roman Catholic. Finding that he was a witness of Jehovah the officer promptly told him that he must return to Nyasaland immediately. In vain the brother tried to explain his position and work, but to no avail. He was informed that If he did not go quietly and stop arguing he would be beaten and then deported by force. Not even a request to hold a baptism was allowed and the brother was sent back on the next train. Greatly disappointed, the brethren from the two companies asked permission to send two representatives to Nyasaland to receive training in order that they might return and organize their two companies. Such an arrangement may be worked out shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conditions vary according to the district, but always It is opposition to the work. The companies near to the Dedza district of Nyasaland find that they are not interrupted in their work, but if anyone shows any sign of being interested in the message, word is passed to the priest, who arranges for that person to be beaten, threatened and deprived of all books belonging to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a great need for a European brother to be In this country. Natives have very few rights and but little justice. A Portuguese-speaking white brother would be able to present a proper defense in cases of injustice and persecution. Letters of complaint from the Nyasaland branch office are seldom answered, and never of any avail.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago the Society sent missionaries to Panama to help organize the work there. Splendid results have been attained. During the more prosperous war years, when employment was at its peak in the Canal Zone, not much witnessing was done in the interior of Panama. Now, however, unemployment is prevalent in the Canal Zone section; and, due to the unsettled economic conditions, many of the Panamanians are moving into towns in the interior. With this migration, we find a number of Jehovah’s witnesses who are also on the move; so the witness of the Kingdom is spreading throughout all the country. About four-fifths of the population of the republic of Panama live away from the cities in the Canal Zone, and all of this multitude must also be preached to. The branch servant gives us an interesting experience that occurred in one of the interior towns. There are wonderful prospects for Theocracy’s increase to continue in Panama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in January we were favored with a visit by Brother Knorr and his traveling companion Brother R. E. Morgan, which, of course, had a very stimulating effect in improving the service in Panama, and arrangements were at that time made to send more Gilead-trained ministers to aid in the progress of the work here, along with other suggested changes that would keep the increase moving ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we have had some well-attended and constructive circuit assemblies and the companies have profited from these in becoming better organized and equipped to carry on the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two of the Gilead graduates from the Panama city missionary home asked permission to spend a month or so in a town in the interior where they were to be assigned after the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in August. They had some very interesting experiences. Here is one: As one of the missionaries was working from door to door she noticed that not far behind her was a Catholic priest watching and taking note of what she was doing. Finally, he passed and sat down in the doorway of a little shop where two men were talking, knowing she would call there next. Surmising he was there to start an argument, she directed her witness to the two men and introduced the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Sea Dios Veraz&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> explaining how the book tells of the wonderful provision Jehovah has made so that men may gain life eternal and live again, as Adam and Eve did, in a beautiful paradise. The men kept nodding in agreement while looking from her to the priest, wondering just what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally the priest butted in and asked what the keys were that Jesus gave to Peter. He sat there with a smirk on his face as she carefully explained. Then he said the keys authorized the apostles to forgive sins and that the priests were successors to the apostles. By this time many had gathered around to listen. So she took her Bible from her bag and asked him to find a scripture that would support such a statement. He didn’t even know how to begin to find anything in the Bible and, of course, all the people present noticed this. So he changed the subject to Peter being the head of the church. To this the sister located the scriptures where Jesus is identified as the head of the church and asked him to read them, which he did. Then he blurted out, “Oh, your Bible is different from the real Bible that we have.” As they were only a few doors from the church she asked him to please get his Bible and she would show him the very same in it, but he refused to do that. By this time there were about twenty people around listening intently to the discussion and many were making remarks in her favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the benefit of those present the missionary began a discussion on the new earth and why the Catholic Church had kept such wonderful news away from the people and forbidden them to read the Bible. The priest tried to defend himself with the usual lies, but each time she would hand him her Bible to show all those there listening where the Bible taught such. As he continued to reject her Bible she finally challenged him to go to the church and get his own Bible and from that she would show we were to inherit the earth if faithful and die if unfaithful. He again refused even though many of those present urged him to go and get it. By this he really exposed himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By this time the discussion had been going on for an hour or so but no one left. Then, as they usually do when caught, the priest began to say we were Protestants and in a bookselling business, along with the usual slander. The Witness explained for the benefit of the people who were there how the books were placed and that many were left free if the people could not contribute. Then two other pioneers came by and joined the discussion, which was just about more than the priest could take, so he resorted to more slander, to which the sister replied: “Well, why don’t you investigate and really see for yourself what our work is, just as we have investigated the Catholic organization and its works.” With this they turned and left him there, very pale, because he knew as well as they that the majority of the people knew about the workings of the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While working there the two missionaries and another pioneer placed more than 200 books and 40 subscriptions and started about 50 Bible studies and had 2 publishers reporting time in the field service. Truly the harvest is ripe for a great ingathering of the Lord’s “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four of the local brethren attended the International convention in New York and upon returning had much to tell of by way of encouragement to those who were less fortunate in making the trip and we all feel at greater unity than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the small inland country in South America called Paraguay a good witness is being given. The country was founded by Jesuits, and the Catholic organization has pretty full control over the one and a half million people who live in Paraguay. Here again it is easily seen that the Catholics have kept the people uneducated and thus slowed down their advancement in civilization. The Paraguayans are poor and backward in their way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gilead graduates who are missionaries in Paraguay had to work very hard during the year to maintain their position and remain in that land. However, they were successful in maintaining their status with the government. They have done much good in spreading the truth. Certainly the 56 per cent increase in number of publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom has brought joy to all those serving Theocracy’s increase in Paraguay. The branch servant writes the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently acting as a circuit servant I was privileged to visit a company in the interior. In order to get there one must go on horseback. The brethren had made arrangements to meet me in a small village, having an extra horse for me. Early the next morning we started on our journey and we arrived at our destination just before sunset. There I was received with much love and the brethren were glad to receive instructions from the theocratic organization. Near their territory is an Indian tribe that worships one great spirit. One family is especially of good will toward the Kingdom message, so arrangements were made for me to visit this family while I was serving the company. With one of the sons of the pioneer sister acting as Interpreter into the Guarani language a general picture was given of man from his creation until now, and of Jehovah’s new world of righteousness and its blessings and of the privileges of sharing in the telling of these good things. Their facial expressions reflected the sincere thirst for the waters of life. And now other families in this same tribe know that that great spirit is Jehovah the Creator, because this Indian man who sought truth is now preaching to others what he learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another company was formed by five German publishers who left the Asuncion company with a desire to spread the Kingdom message into one of the German Mennonite colonies in the “Chaco” wilderness, and to preach to their parents and acquaintances. Traveling by river boat, train, bus, and then oxcart they reached their destination in three weeks. They have now reached a peak of nine publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the service year five new companies were organized, five new peaks in the number of publishers were reached, and an increase of 55 per cent in the number of publishers was realized over the preceding year. Truly it is the Lord who is gathering His other sheep, for this increase came during the past year while here in Paraguay we have been under martial law and the majority of the people live in fear of the government. The Catholic Church with its “Holy Year”, many saints and “Virgins” and its Catholic Action is doing all she can to hinder the ingathering of the Lord’s other sheep. The people are taught that there are but two powers, Catholicism and communism and that anything not Catholic is naturally communistic. Hence they teach that Protestantism is united with communism. The result of this is that many people fear to have Bible studies because they fear that their neighbors will call the police and report them as having secret meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year all foreigners living in the country had to reregister with the government and much difficulty was experienced by the Gilead missionaries. At first they refused to register us, telling us that our case was to be handled separately. Later we were informed that we were in the country illegally and subject to arrest. With the aid of a good-will person much was accomplished. This ordeal of registering lasted over a period of seven months but at this date all Gilead graduates living in the home have been registered, but much is still pending. Efforts to oust the missionaries have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font5">Peru has been a hard country t,o get opened up for missionary service, but during the year 21 additional Gilead graduates entered that work, joining the ones already faithfully serving the Kingdom interests in Peru. Peru, of course, is another Catholic country in South America, and the principal language is Spanish. The Watch Tower missionaries there have gone forward, learning the language of the people and helping them gain a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. They are preaching the Word, and the Lord has certainly blessed their efforts. They had a 70 per cent increase during the 1950 service year, reaching a new peak of 147, and with marvelous prospects for the future. The branch servant gives us some very interesting observations, which are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all the work done in the few years here, Jehovah’s witnesses are not lulled to sleep thinking they have put a substantial ‘dent’ in this old world’s organization. Oh no! for we haven't even covered all the capital city of Lima once yet. Here the objective was to increase the number of home Bible studies and push forward the public meeting work during the year. The Lima company ran 42 such meetings during the year as well as 2 circuit assemblies. The days spent with the brethren during the two assemblies were really joyous ones. The people got to see that these assemblies are for their benefit to bring them life-giving knowledge. How they did enjoy the cafeteria arrangements too provided along the same lines as in the States I The attendances equaled that of the Memorial celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The branch too was busier this year because of the new companies formed and the additional missionary homes now operating. Compiling the report from month to month indicated how the percentage of increase was making a fair bid to surpass that of the previous year, and it did. The experiences of the brethren were many and will give the reader some idea of how the people of good will from every walk of life are “hearing”, and saying “come” too, inviting others to drink of the water of life and live. One Gilead graduate writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The poor people are so steeped In the traditions of men that they gullibly accept the assertion of the Catholic Hierarchy that the term ‘Christian’ applies only to the Catholics; hence, they think the two terms are synonymous. Practically everyone here believes there are only two kinds of religion, and they call the one ‘Protestant’ and the other ‘Christian’ (Catholic). One Gilead missionary overheard one of his Bible studies enthusiastically answering her Catholic mother’s question as to what religion the ‘truth’ is. She said, ‘It’s not Methodist, it’s not Pentecostal, it’s not Adventist, why, it’s not even Christian I It’s just the plain truth, that’s all I’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another Gilead missionary writes: “Peru, like so many other countries, is a land of people who are born, eat, sleep, learn, yes, and die too under the watchful eye of Catholicism. Some rebel but just don’t know where to turn next. Mrs. ------ and her daughter were just such people. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">couldn’t accept the dry husks of religious nonsense, and made the fact known. Because of this they were forced to suffer the persecuting cry of ‘Protestants’ in a Catholic land. When we knocked at her door, we found them determined to go to the capital city of Lima to buy themselves a Bible and turn to it, their only refuge in seeking the truth. We had her Bible and more too, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True'.</span><span class="font4"> A study was started, and with each chapter another religious shackle was broken, another heavy weight lifted from their hearts, to be replaced by the joy that only the truth can bring. Now, five months later, they have rallied to Jehovah’s established Signal, the Kingdom, and are among the swelling ranks of his happy people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we begin to describe with mere words the power of a tornado, to limit to a sentence the brilliance of the dawn, to put words the way an idea is born, we can but give a faint reflection of the reality. How much more so with the truths of God and the progress of his work! The facts and figures of the expanding of his message can but give a half-picture of how it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have here, for instance, the city of Trujillo, about fifty thousand in population. We can say with truth that at the beginning of the calendar year of 1950 no one in Trujillo (with the exception of six newly arrived and slightly confused missionaries, whose entire vocabulary in Spanish would not have covered half a page) knew anything about the Kingdom. We can say also that less than six months later these same missionaries have had the privilege of seeing six “other sheep” manifest themselves to the extent of joining in the preaching work. We can tell of the celebration of the Memorial at which twenty-one were present, how the spirit of the Lord moved them, so that within a week five had been in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lawyer, having searched all the ways of Satan’s world, religion, politics, education, philosophy, had nearly reached the conclusion that there was no truth in the world. He was contacted by a missionary, whose halting Spanish could say no more than “I have two books on the Bible and the kingdom of God”. On the first back-call, when asked what he thought of the chapter on &quot;The New Earth”, the lawyer replied with a very complete summary, even understanding the difference between the heavenly and the earthly hope and the government by the princes. He made marvelous progress through three and a half months of study and became a publisher after attending the circuit assembly In Lima.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then there is the young sefiorita who after two and one half months of study reached the point where she wanted to tell others. We can look at her report slips coming regularly each month and see her desire to help others filled, in part, in that she had a home Bible study after only a month of service. Not exactly a “home” Bible study, for it is in the local “jail”. One Sunday one of the missionary sisters went with her to the “jail”. Hearing that people were there to discuss the Bible the prisoners crowded around, many showing their little “Testaments”, saying, “We too have the Bible and want to learn more about it.” Another visitor listening in on the discussion remarked, cynically perhaps, but truthfully, “You will find more honest and sincere people in here than on the streets.&quot; This visitor, so impressed by the discussion that he overheard, came to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study that evening and has manifested much interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This account could go on and on, telling of the dozens of rich and poor, of lawyer and doctor, of shoemaker and photographer, of student and professor, who have heard the Word preached. Some have turned away in disdain; others have let the light of truth find a place In their hearts and turned their faces toward the new world. We know what we bring the people here is the truth of God, flowing as it does from an infinite source. It cannot be limited by such finite things as words. We realize we cannot put in words the expression on a poor cobbler’s face when he learns that the new world is for him too, nor can we with human sounds reproduce the bond that lies between our new brethren and ourselves. For this, as does all our work, springs from the truth divine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As one grows in the truth, his appreciation of the favored position he holds as an ambassador of the New World society becomes more manifest. The “faithful and wise servant” continues to see to it that meat in due season reaches out to the ends of the earth, and this brings blessings and joys to the servants of the Lord. It strengthens and equips them for further service. The Filipino brethren can look back over the past year with real joy and recount many blessings. They had a 50 per cent increase, reaching a peak of 10,055 publishers. To add to this blessing there was the arrival of more Gilead graduates, while some Filipino brethren left the country for training in the States at Gilead School. The circuit and district assemblies also were a source of joy and blessing in the Philippines. With all these rich blessings there are hardships to be overcome, but the brethren are taking them in their stride. The branch servant submitted the report which follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Probably the greatest joy of all is to consider the increase that God has given us. There have been ten new peaks of publishers, the highest being 10,055 in August. The average increase for the entire year amounts to 50 per cent. Company organizations have increased from 315 to 345, with more isolated groups still writing in for permission to be organized as companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer ranks are expanding at a very satisfactory pace. We started the year with 205 but we closed off with an all-time peak of 307 in the full-time ranks. More and more are seeing that the pioneer service is possible for them and they are working toward this treasured career in God’s service. They are learning that it has more appeal than any other activity under the sun. The more weights and burdens of Satan’s world they set aside, the more they feel the joy of full freedom that precedes our entry into the new world. Then, too, the pioneer service brings out so many of the inherited talents that one would never be encouraged to use while serving Satan's systems of things. Jehovah knows they are there and he can bring them out. The pioneer service is doing it for many of our brethren. Some were formerly so shy they found it extremely difficult to present the Kingdom message to strangers. They had lived a life of seclusion in some </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">barrio</span><span class="font4"> or town where there was little inducement to cultivate their talents. The daily use of their tongues in the pioneer service has made them skillful in expounding the Scriptures to the interested. The boldness and conviction they have cultivated reminds one of Psalm 119 : 98-100, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time in our theocratic history the Society was pleased to select three from among these pioneers to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. This really caused a stir. Off to America they went in December of 1949. Before they had graduated the Society selected another six to follow them into the sixteenth class of Gilead. Others are now spurred on to establish a good pioneer record and qualify for entry into this institution of advanced ministerial training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Probably one of the greatest expansion problems is to provide the pure truths of God’s Word in a language the people can understand. The Philippine Republic is no exception to this difficulty. We constantly face the problem of serving people who speak many languages and dialects. The Society published four more booklets in the dialects during the year, two in Hiligaynon-Visayan and one each in Cebu-Visayan and Pangasinan. Now we have a special treat in the form of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> in Tagalog, released at the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in New York. This will be a tremendous aid in training more publishers among the Tagalog-speaking regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have other problems too that are peculiar to the Philippines. The executive departments of the government are unable to cope fully with the situation they face throughout the country. There are not enough trained and equipped police to maintain law and order. The long and wasteful civil war between the government forces and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hukbala-haps</span><span class="font4"> has spread terror throughout Luzon and Panay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Life seems very cheap in this land, and the brethren have to exercise the utmost in discretion in order to carry on in the service. There are reports of five brethren being murdered during the year, but the circumstances surrounding their murders are unreported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Theocracy's Increase Assembly climaxed our year. For the first time Filipino brethren put forth the effort to attend a convention on foreign soil. It took faith and a lot of preparation as well as funds. But it was worth it. Three graduates of Gilead and five other brethren made their own arrangements to attend with the six who had been called to Gilead. Their faith was well rewarded. Words are inadequate to describe that thrilling event. It has made a deep and lasting impression on our minds. We are better equipped to meet the problems that now immediately precede Armageddon. We appreciate God’s goodness and we want to swell louder the song of praise to Him. We look forward to better organization here and far grander increase when the Gilead-trained Filipinos get back and put to use their stored-up knowledge.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the service year some unusual opportunities presented themselves in connection with the preaching of the gospel in Norway. Not only was the door-to-door work very successful, but the preaching of the gospel on the streets made much progress. This was due to the fact that certain cases were brought before the police and the higher courts of the land and the principal governmental departments. The brethren in Norway rejoice over the success achieved in presenting our case before the rulers, for it gives them greater freedom in presenting the message now. Of course, they are not without problems. As long as Kingdom publishers are in this old world, they are going to meet the obstacles that face every Christian. But, by the Lord’s grace, the brethren in Norway will continue to take a fearless stand on the side of right. A good report was turned in by the branch servant for Norway for the 1950 service year, and excerpts from it appear here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1948 two pioneers were stopped In their door-to-door work by the local police in a small town. The brethren were arrested and booked for trial when they refused to recognize that their work came under the State law of commercial selling where police permission is required. The county court fined the brethren kr. 15.00 each. The matter was then appealed to a higher court but was denied reconsideration. The Society took the matter up with the Justice Department through our lawyer. After a long time of waiting a letter was received from the Department of Justice wherein they quoted the decision of the Department of Commerce and included the remark that the state attorney was agreed therewith. The decision stated that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is of public and general interest and therefore does not come under the provisions made in the Trade Law where permission must first be obtained from the police to engage in commercial selling. Thus, by the Lord’s grace, we have our preaching work from door to door recognized by three chief departments of state, Department of Commerce, state attorney and Department of Justice, as of public and general interest and therefore proper to do without seeking or obtaining police permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November, 1949, seven of the brethren in Oslo were arrested while engaged in the street magazine work. They were taken to the police station and heard before a higher police official there. This official was not willing to listen to the brethren explain the purpose of the magazine work and how it was carried on. He did not “want any preaching!” ‘The magazine work was done without police permission and therefore was unlawful and must be stopped at once.’ To his question, “Will you stop standing on the streets with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?”</span><span class="font4"> the brethren in one voice said “No”. “If you want to be martyrs, I shall help you be so,” said the official. The brethren were fined each kr. 5.00, or 3 days in jail. This too was refused and the case came before the city court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here opportunity was afforded to explain how and why the magazine work was done. It was clearly brought out that there was no commercial gain but it was engaged in for the purpose of publishing the glad tidings of God’s kingdom. The city court decided against us in this case. We then appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway. The case was considered here and the decision unanimously reversed, giving us the victory. In the Supreme Court decision it was pointed out that the original intention of the ordinance was not to regulate the sale of magazines or newspapers on the streets. On the contrary it was pointed out that the original wording of the ordinance was changed before its adoption so as not to include the sale of newspapers or magazines. So again the Lord gave his servants the victory, that his name may yet be praised and proclaimed publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A number of the brethren were arrested time after time as they stood on the streets each week before the decision of the Supreme Court. Many opportunities were given to present a witness to the police on these occasions. Many of the police were extremely displeased to arrest the witnesses and several times they would side up to the publishers and ask them to move across the street so they would be out of their district and they would not have to make an arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were able to have 34 brethren from this country attend the international convention in New York. There was considerable trouble in obtaining visas for several of them; however, the Lord’s guidance made it possible to overcome all obstacles. It was necessary for the brethren to meet personally for an interview at the American embassy or with the nearest American consul. Here they were asked why they were attending the convention. Were they going to preach over there? What did they expect to hear? What were their views as to extreme pacifism? etc. After the brethren had all been heard the embassy called the Society’s office and wanted an interview to discuss the visa matter further. The brother from the Society was asked point-blank, “Do you believe in extreme pacifism and do you preach such?” The answer “definitely not” was enough to grant the brethren their visas. Again a victory unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man had read </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and wrote to this office stating that that was the best book he had ever read, and could we send him more? He was sent more literature and his name was sent to the nearest company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another man after having read a booklet made a special trip to the Society’s office so that he might obtain more literature. This was supplied him together with the name of the company servant and the address of the company meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the far end of one of Norway’s many long, narrow valleys came a letter expressing the interest of a man in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font4"> He too wished more literature, which was sent him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From an island with a population of three families came a letter to the office from a person asking us to send some literature so she might have something to distribute when she was able to come to the mainland. Another man writes in reply to our letter to him explaining our method of preaching, “Of course I want to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are a few of the many letters we have received from the bolder of the many isolated people living the length and breadth of this land who are hungry for the truth and desiring more knowledge so that they too might have a share in praising Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another thing that gave us great joy was the number of publishers reporting during the summer months. Previous years the summer months were very low in the number of publishers reporting. After holding this sorry fact before the brethren at all assemblies and continually in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> it was truly a time of rejoicing to see that in July we were only one publisher under our peak in April. Then in August we reached a new peak for the year, of 1,647 publishers. We had seven new peaks in number of publishers during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not much news came through from Poland by the end of the year. It was learned through the newspapers that the minister of public ministry, Major Dziemidok, stated the organization known as Jehovah’s witnesses was banned; and, according to the minister, it was working in the interests of the United States government against Poland. He claimed that Jehovah’s witnesses were a spy organization with headquarters in Brooklyn. It is certainly hard for people who are allowed to think and express themselves freely to conceive how the minds of some people work, such as those with the communistic mind in Poland. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been an open book in Poland for years and everyone knew that they were preaching God’s kingdom as the only hope for the world. No one in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses dabbled in politics; but Jehovah’s witnesses carried on relief work for the benefit of the people of Poland, distributing clothes and food. Still, when the Communist government wants to wipe out an organization, they trump up false charges and accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of representing a foreign power. Reports show:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first call at the branch by the authorities was in April, 1950, and then the brethren at the branch office were put through a severe grilling by the police. The second call made upon the branch office by the authorities was on June 21, 1950. It was at that time that all of the brethren were arrested and a seal was put upon the branch. The decree went forth to close all the Kingdom Halls, and these too were sealed. The greater number of company servants and other servants in the companies were arrested. All meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses were forbidden. Door-to-door work was not allowed. From one end of Poland to the other arrests took place. It has been reported through certain channels that the only exceptions to this were elderly women and mothers with children up to eight months old. A vigorous search was carried on in the homes of Jehovah’s witnesses. Literature was taken and destroyed. It was not long before many of the brethren who had been arrested and put Into prison were sent off to labor camps. However, the report is that those who are located in the prisons and labor camps are continually preaching the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is indeed a pleasure to report that before the ban took place 28,918 persons attended the Memorial service in Poland. Only 85 of these professed to be of the anointed. This shows that practically all the people in Poland associated with the truth are of the “other sheep” class, desiring to live upon the earth under the rule of the kingdom of heaven. They are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to remain faithful. As to the publishers for the Kingdom, it was reported that a peak was reached during the year of 18,116. The average number, serving regularly every month, was 14,900, or a 23 per cent increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not all of these brethren are in prisons or labor camps, but they are closely watched as to their activity. And it can be said that these brethren are active and talking. They are fulfilling the command of Christ Jesus, ‘Go, ye, therefore, and disciple all nations.’ Again the scripture is true that when persecutions increase and difficulties fall upon Jehovah’s witnesses as God’s servants and they are scattered throughout the land, they go ahead and preach with even greater determination. That is what is happening in Poland today. They can accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of everything they want to, but their accusations will never change the truth of the matter. They are servants of the Most High and are willing to lay down their lives in the interests of God’s kingdom. The prayers of Christians everywhere will ascend unto the Most High, beseeching Jehovah’s blessing and favor to attend these fellow workers. In this final end of the great conflict between the Devil's organization and the Lord’s, God’s servants will come off victorious, gaining the life they seek in the new world and the privilege of worshiping in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">1950 has been another year of Theocracy’s increase in Puerto Rico. Not only have greater numbers come into the organization to give praise to the Lord, but those already in the truth have pressed on with greater efficiency and effectiveness. This little island in the Caribbean sea is a pleasant place to preach the Word. The majority of the people are open-minded enough to at least give an audience to the preachers of the Kingdom message. However, the cares of this world and the pleasures and diversions of this life keep most from awakening to the criticalness of the time and the urgent need for action now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The habit of Latin Americans is to put things off until </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">manana.</span><span class="font5"> But </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">manana</span><span class="font5"> will be too late, and it is necessary for all to hear the message just as soon as possible. The brethren are doing what they can to the best of their ability to have those of good will hear the Word being preached. The branch servant gives us a report for Puerto Rico and also for the Virgin Islands, which comes under the Puerto Rican branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Contributing heavily to the improved activity throughout the island was the appointment at the beginning of the service year of a full-time circuit servant. The diligent and conscientious service of this brother has done much to help the brethren to keep going forward in their service. The stepped-up activity that accompanied his visits had much to do with our reaching five new peaks in number of publishers during the year. His visits to isolated persons of good will have also been very beneficial and occasionally brought very interesting resuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On going to the little mountain town of Ciales to follow up a good-will slip sent to him by the branch, and after walking a mile out of town and climbing a steep slope to a little house near the top, he found the man, a fellow in his seventies, seated in the doorway deeply engrossed in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Is at Hand.</span><span class="font4"> The man and his wife were delighted at having been contacted, and he stated that he earnestly desired to know how he could serve Jehovah God during the years of life that remained to him. When called on a few weeks later he had placed all the books and booklets left with him on the initial visit. Within a few months, and after only three visits by the circuit servant, he was conducting a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study in his home and had an average of eight in attendance. This man has been a member of the Disciples of Christ Church for over twenty years but was quick to recognize the voice of Jehovah’s true Shepherd when he heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of an enthusiastic circuit assembly in Cayey it was announced that our one circuit was to be divided into “A” and “B” sections and thus next time there would be two assemblies instead of one. This proved to be a good move. At Cayey our Friday night attendance had been 125 and our Sunday public lecture brought 430 listeners. How would our attendance be, now that we had divided the circuit? Six months later we got the answer. At Mayaguez in section “B” for the western half of the island Friday night saw 150 in attendance and the public lecture in a park brought a peak attendance of 550, about 400 of these being of the public. Next month at Cataflo for section “A” Friday night attendance was 175 and 255 turned out for the public lecture in the plaza. Thus we saw that we had obtained multiplication by a process of division. More publishers were enabled to attend and two cities, instead of one, received a grand witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W’e hope that in the future Magazine Day will receive greater attention, for even with the limited support given it thus far it has resulted in a marvelous distribution of individual copies of the Watchtower and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines. Thus placements of magazines jumped from 14,000 last year to over 31,000 this year. On the Saturday of our circuit assembly at Cayey 105 publishers placed over 540 magazines in the homes and on the streets. This in a town of only 9,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are so many reasons why the 1951 service year can be the biggest and best yet. We are now regularly conducting over 600 home Bible studies throughout the island. Surely many of these truth seekers will before long awaken to their grand privilege of serving the true God and reaping the reward of everlasting life. Then, too, at the time of this writing, some 50 Gilead graduates are to be found in our island, a total of 21 having arrived since the sending of last year’s report. Located principally in 7 missionary homes, their trained ability put to work in unified activity is certain to have a grand effect and bring sight and hearing to many of the spiritually blind and deaf ones of this land. The publications containing the precious Kingdom truths are now filtering into every nook and corner of the island and the seed sown is blossoming forth with such fruitful abundance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>THE VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The three quaint and quiet little towns of Charlotte Amalie, Christiansted and Frederiksted form the bases of operations for the activity of the Kingdom publishers, including four graduates of Gilead. The company at Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas, reached a peak of 38 publishers during the year and for the last six months has held an excellent average of 36 home Bible studies. More publishers have been emboldened to support Magazine Day and magazine placements have climbed from about 25 a month to over 150 a month by the close of the year. In May the main floor of the building where the missionary home is located became vacant and the company quickly rented it for a Kingdom Hall. More spacious and comfortable, their meeting attendance has steadily grown, with as many as 45 at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study. And though not rich in this world’s goods they have done very well in bearing the expense of this larger meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christiansted company in St. Croix also presents a picture of steady improvement. When visited by a circuit servant from Puerto Rico it was found that very little organized witnessing was being done, due to the reluctance on the part of the publishers to witness from door to door in the town. It was suggested that they make a start by working the little settlements in the nearby rural sections of the island. It seems that this has helped them and that little by little they are overcoming their timidity. Toward the close of the year ten of them cast aside their doubts and hesitancy and were Immersed, being the first ones in the island to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Especially interesting have been their experiences in the public meeting work. A series was begun in the local prison for the benefit of the Inmates. More than a dozen lectures were presented and were greatly appreciated with many expressions of genuine interest made. The warden, a music lover, offered to play the Kingdom songs on the piano so that singing could be had along with the lectures. He was looking forward with eagerness to using the Society’s new songbook.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is very difficult to get reports from the country of Romania. This is another nation hidden behind the “iron curtain”. The brethren who were in charge of the work in Romania have been imprisoned. Their trial came up in July of this year, according to reports received, and the brethren gave a fine witness. A very recent report reveals that the branch servant and another brother were sentenced to ten years of forced labor and sent to the Danube Canal to work there. Others were sentenced to from two to eight years, but it is not known where they have been sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not many service reports have come through during the year, but those that have been received show that the brethren are active and they are preaching the Word. Even though the Romanian government occupied the Society’s office and living quarters in August, 1949, and closed down the branch in Bucharest, the good news is still being preached. The Society’s office equipment, the literature and supplies, have all been seized, and the principal brethren imprisoned; but even this could not stop the work. The government says the preaching of the gospel by Jehovah’s witnesses is not legal; but, on the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses have the command from the Almighty God that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world. By God’s grace, the Lord’s people in Romania have continued to speak the good news as set forth in the Word of the Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of this, the brethren have gone through great persecutions and trials, and some have lost their lives. But despite the pressure from the enemy, which continued to increase throughout the year, word was received that “in spite of a great drought, one sees a crop of pure wheat ripening”. This is substantiated by figures which show that there was an 8 per cent increase in the number of witnesses in Romania during the year. We rejoice with our brethren and continually keep them in mind. There is one pure language spoken by God’s servants from one end of the earth to the other. They know the language of the Lord, for they have read his Word and they use it now to comfort themselves, their brethren, and those who mourn in the world. The work will continue until the battle of Armageddon, because, when God is with us, it makes no difference how many are against us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark245"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">With the admonition “Preach the word” ringing in the ears of the witnesses of Jehovah in South Africa, the publishers pressed on in good advances. They arc pleased to be fed and nourished by the spiritual food provided through the Lord’s organization, and it stimulated them in South Africa the same as it strengthened the brethren throughout the whole world. The same good message from the Word of God to continue on faithfully in discipling all nations was heeded by Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the earth. Jehovah added his blessing and gave the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problems in South Africa are different from those in other parts of the world, but the same instruction from God holds true. No matter who the people are or where they live the counsel that the Lord has set forth in his Word aids every one in taking the proper course which leads to life eternal. The branch office located in Cape Town looks after the work generally in the Union of South Africa and in addition takes care of the work done in the following countries: Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, St. Helena, SouthWest Africa and Swaziland. Reports are furnished by the branch servant on all of these plaees, and you will find them interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New companies are springing up in places that have never had a company before; others have doubled and trebled their number of publishers during the past twelve months. In Cape Town six new units (four European and two African) have been established during the year, bringing the total to 14 units for a city of less than half a million population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last October two pioneer sisters were sent to Ladysmith, Natal, famous for its stand in the Anglo-Boer war. Pioneers had previously visited the town but no European company had yet been formed. When the circuit servant passed through In January, 35 persons attended the public talk and 6 publishers had commenced the preaching work. A company was formed. In May, on the occasion of his first circuit visit, 14 publishers were in action. How was this accomplished? The pioneers are alert to theocratic counsel and advice. They balance their work by placing literature, making sure they call back and develop book studies where-ever possible. The Dutch Reformed church issued its usual warnings. The predikant told the people from the pulpit to be kind to the girls, even to give them a cup of tea, but </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font4"> to discuss religion with them. If they had Watchtower books they should burn them. Honest-hearted people, anxious to learn the truth, are becoming tired of that kind of thing and are investigating for themselves. When a deacon called on a couple requesting the usual donation he was asked why the predikant did not come along to see them. The reply was that he was a very busy man. This caused the wife to remark that the Watchtower girls called every week and she had not seen her predikant for two years. This couple are planning to attend the assembly in October to be immersed and to enjoy the association of the brethren at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An African circuit servant had a clergyman listen to his public talk “True Riches—How Obtained?” This man insisted on asking questions at the close of the meeting. The circuit servant offered to call on him to answer his questions privately, but, as he insisted, the circuit servant let him go ahead. One question was: “Are you educated? Did you have a theological training at a theological institute?” He was told that Jesus Christ did not go to a theological school for his training. The minister asked: “Where Is that written in the Bible?” and was directed to John 7:15. The public enjoyed immensely that scripture being read, but the clergyman was so annoyed that in his fury he tore to shreds a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> in his hand in front of the public. This enabled all present to see who had the spirit of the Lord and who not</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But not all clergymen are like the foregoing one. An African circuit servant called on one a few months back. This man appreciated the message and began to study with the help of one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Within two months he became associated with the local company and a little later he and his entire household were publishing the message of the Kingdom. Before he became a publisher he had a notice in front of his house reading, “Rev. ------ of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apostolic Church of Nazareth.” Now another board has taken the place of the former and on the new board is written “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A principal of a school in the rurals was contacted by a European publisher, subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and took </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and eight booklets. A month later the publisher was in that district again and made </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> back-call. Imagine his surprise when he was greeted with “Brother ------”! More literature and a Bible was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When told of the circuit servant visits he welcomed the idea and immediately offered to accommodate one for the period of his stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the service year one of the African circuit servants received a course of training In the Laubach method of combating illiteracy. Thereafter he visited the various circuit assembly centers. Those brethren in the circuit who could arrange to do so came along on the Monday and received instruction during the week. Those showing the most aptitude to pick up the Laubach method were appointed as instructors in their company. To date 250 classes have been organized, with an average of 6 pupils in each class. The classes are held on three or four days per week and two hours are spent on each lesson. Our first aim is to help illiterate brethren to read and write their own language. Classes are being held in Zulu, Sesuto, Xosa, Sechuana, Sepedi and English. It takes about 30 lessons before the pupils can read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At those centers where the brethren have been diligent and attended the classes regularly, remarkable progress has been made. For example, at one center at which 23 pupils enrolled 20 could read and write four months later. At another center 7 out of 11 pupils could read and write in a similar period of time. Some hundreds of brethren have been helped to read and write during the year and as a result have become more efficient witnesses. They are now able to conduct home Bible studies, and share in public meeting activity. After learning to read and write their own language they switch over to English, and the mastery of English opens up the whole range of the Society’s publications to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the Union 41 brethren were privileged to attend the international convention at New York. Of that number 9 remained after the convention to join the 16th class at Gilead. As this report is made up the others are arriving back and the brethren throughout the country are eagerly looking forward to the “echoes from Yankee Stadium” which will be one of the features at our assembly next month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in the office, printery and shipping has greatly Increased. We received 17,651 letters, to compare with 13,237 the previous year. The printery turned out 6,030,922 pieces, including 213,736 copies of the magazines in Afrikaans and Zulu and 444,727 booklets in seven languages. New subscriptions entered totaled 13,821, of which number 7,937 were obtained during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> continues to go out in six languages each month, English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Cinyanja, Sesuto and Xosa, the number sent out during the year being 84,672.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneers from the Union visited Angola in 1938 and placed considerable literature before trekking south again. Then came the war and nothing was heard of Angola for some years. However, there are obviously some of the Lord’s “other sheep” in that country too and now they are being located and fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several years ago a Portuguese-speaking African received the truth in Nyasaland. Later he became a pioneer and went into Mozambique (Portuguese East Africa) to spread the good news of God’s kingdom. He met up with much opposition and persecution and endured great hardships as he spread the truth among his own people in the lower Zambesi valley. He was arrested and held without trial for a long period of time and then eventually deported to Angola. He continues to work under surveillance but, as he still has his tongue, he continues to “preach the word”. It was a real joy to receive his first report, which indicated that 5 others had shared with him in the work in January. Since then the work has gone steadily forward and the latest report to come to hand, the July report, shows that 14 publishers were in action that month. Literature in both Portuguese and Ciuyanja has reached him. Eleven home Bible studies are in operation and in both June and July three public meetings were held.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>BASUTOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Today a great noise of ‘crying sheep’ can be heard. Shut up in their prison houses they are crying for liberty and for the opening of the prison doors. They are now awaking to tlie fact that those upon whom they have relied in the past have let them down and done nothing to feed and succor them but, to the contrary, when they cry out for understanding and help reply by trying to bind the chains still closer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently a local newspaper published several articles charging the Witnesses with being “false prophets”. It was intended to frighten the people, but had a boomerang effect. The articles served as a good advertisement for several public talks given in the district immediately thereafter. The people flocked to see and hear the “false prophets” and to listen to the “dreams” about which the newspaper article had written. What a surprise awaited them! The majority who attended were thrilled with the message of truth they heard from God’s Word. Their eyes were opened to many of Babylon’s false doctrines and their hearts were comforted and made glad by the good news of deliverance and of the righteous new world at hand. Now many others, who were unable to be present, are anxious to hear the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, the priests of the largest religious organization in Christendom have ordered the people to burn any of the books already in their possession and not to admit Jehovah’s witnesses into their homes, but this too has only increased the desire and enthusiasm of the people to hear what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A trumpet has been blown in the midst of the mountains and the echoes are now being heard throughout the entire land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BECHUANALAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark249"></a><span class="font4">Bechuanaland is one of the dark spots of Southern Africa. It is a dry and thirsty land but in recent years refreshing streams of truth have been quenching the thirst of those who seek after righteousness. In 1949 there was just one company in the entire country. Now there are three, and one of these, which began as a one-man company, has now 36 publishers 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the Catholic Church dominates Basutoland, It is the London Missionary Society that runs Bechuanaland. The visiting circuit servant was asked by a headman of the Bainangwato, “Why do you bring your church here? We have our London church. That is enough.” The circuit servant gave a witness to this headman and others, who then agreed that what they had heard was tlie truth of the Bible and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that the brethren could go on with their work. “I will be glad,” he said, “that the Bechuana should know the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief of the Bangmaketse was more difficult. He ordered the circuit servant to leave “his country”. Asked why and for an explanation of any wrong he had perhaps committed, the chief replied in angry mood: “I have heard a rumor about your church from Mmathethe because all the people have left the church of London and there is no London church left there.” (This is the district where one publisher became 36 in the course of the year I) In reply to his statement that he wanted only one church in his country and that he even objected to the brethren’s working with the Bible alone, the circuit servant pointed out that freedom of worship, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly were permitted in other British territories, so why should the Bechuanaland protectorate be an exception? The chief then replied that he was going to rule his country in his own way and that every man at Mmathethe would be forced to go back to the church or forfeit his property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The poor people are forced to work for their chiefs, priests and teachers, often without being paid for months. If a man refuses to work under these conditions he may be beaten or his cow or ox taken by the chief. When he goes to the commissioner or police to complain he is just driven back to the chief again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A request made to the office of the British high commissioner to have the ban on the literature removed in that country was turned down without explanation. There is no valid reason for the prohibition, and Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to go forward ‘preaching the Word’ to the meek and teachable ones.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Conditions on this small island in the South Atlantic do not improve. The population continues to decrease and is now less than 5,000. The poor people have to struggle so hard for a means of livelihood that they do not have much time left over to study or even to listen to the Kingdom message. When they do listen their hearts are gladdened and comforted, but they have so many worries constantly besetting them that they soon forget what they hear and the publishers find it difficult to get them to settle down to regular home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These difficulties notwithstanding, the few publishers on the island have engaged regularly in the work each month throughout the year. They have shared in all features of the work and have undoubtedly done their best to ‘preach the Word’ as they have had opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In 1929, 1935 and 1942 pioneers from the Union made trips through South-West Africa placing literature and arousing considerable interest. But they did not stay to do the “feeding” work, and hence the interest never took root. Now in 1950 four missionaries have gone into that territory—not with the idea of making a quick trip through the territory but to locate and help the Lord’s “other sheep”. Early in 1950 a missionary home was established at Windhoek, which is the largest town and administrative center, with a European population of 8,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This territory has undergone a rapid development in recent years and the European is prosperous with plenty of this world’s goods. There are no poor people among them. On the other hand the touchy problem of racial animosity is noticeable and the native is sorely suppressed and not permitted to rise above a certain level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the missionaries arrived in Windhoek they faced an acute housing shortage that necessitated their living apart in three different homes with no meeting place to which to invite the good-will. This difficulty has now been overcome. Soon after beginning their work the administration called upon the missionaries for an explanation of their work relative to licensing. The explanation satisfied them, together with a letter supplied by the Society for that purpose, and no further difficulty has been forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie opposition to the ministry comes from so-called “Protestantism”. In the first few months over 2,200 books and Bibles were placed, but the clergy, instead of welcoming such a vast work of Bible education, showed their true position by a series of attacks from the pulpit upon these “foreign” missionaries. The church exercises much influence over the people and they in turn changed their attitude to one of opposition and many handed back the literature when return visits were made. They were advised by the clergy not even to discuss the matter with them. Truly the clergy must bear the responsibility for the spiritual plight of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Situated on the outskirts of Windhoek is a large native location home of approximately 9,000 persons of different tribes. It is among these humble folk that the greatest progress is being made. A German-speaking missionary has undertaken to witness among these people and enjoys many blessings seeing the Kingdom truth take hold. Five native Witnesses were located living here who had moved up from the Union. A company was organized among them and they have proved themselves zealous publishers. Over 25 Bible studies are now conducted here by the missionary alone and more could be held except for the language difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Calling regularly upon the business and office section has impressed many with the Importance of the life-giving message. The office staff in one of the larger businesses has been most friendly and reasonable when they were called upon with the magazines and public meeting leaflets. Upon inquiry the brother found that the one in charge of that section had defended and upheld the work of the Witnesses of which the whole town was talking. He had taken literature on a number of occasions and distributed it to his staff, urging them to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A number of excellent Bible studies are in progress. A study was started with a young woman who had subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> She was delighted with the opportunity of a home Bible study and took </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and contributed 10/- extra for the work. After a few studies she remarked that she was losing any desire to go to church. “Was that right?” She was assured that it was the natural reaction. After seeing some truth she was invited to the lectures, which she attended, took more literature from the display on hand and expressed herself as being thrilled about what she was learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man from out of town obtained a booklet on the street. Reading it that night in his hotel room he was so favorably impressed that he was waiting next morning for the publishers to arrive at their accustomed posts. He expressed his appreciation and was glad that it brought cheer to natives as well as all others. The other missionaries were not interested in helping the natives, but only in helping themselves. Then, like the two men who asked Jesus where he lived that they might learn more, this man also asked that he might call on his next visit to town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Street contacts have resulted in placing literature with people from Belgian Congo, Bechuanaland and Angola. A brother placed 49 books in one day by approaching people on the street and calling at the hotels, meeting these out-oftown visitors. So the message succeeds in penetrating many hitherto untouched areas in vast Africa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">An outstanding difficulty experienced by the brethren is the ban on Watchtower publications by the resident commissioner, which makes it difficult to conduct a home Bible study. Nevertheless it has been possible for the brethren as well as sisters to learn to conduct these home Bible studies with the use of the Bible. House-to-house work is done and public talks are given and the work is progressing in a wonderful way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneering in Swaziland is full of interest. The roads are rough and full of stones, hills, valleys and bush but the publishers go up and down to the kraals, visiting the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the pioneers had an opportunity to give a splendid witness at one of the kraals of the paramount chief. There was a great gathering of many denominations to celebrate “Good Friday”. The pioneer was witnessing in the neighborhood and was invited to attend to “say something”. Considerable consternation was caused when instead of discussing the resurrection as did the ministers, he held forth on “Peace on Earth—When?” He was still talking when his allotted time was up but the paramount chief, who has all the literature of the Society, was enjoying it to the full and signaled to the pioneer to continue and finish his speech. At the conclusion the paramount chief rose up and publicly thanked the pioneer for telling his men the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another great gathering was held several months later at the Royal Kraal (Lozithehlezi). The pioneer was again invited, and this time the assembly continued for two days during which time the pioneer had further opportunity to explain the Kingdom truths to the people. Four religious ministers present pulled their collars around their necks and declared: “We are no more religious ministers but Jehovah’s witnesses” and asked the pioneer if he had any books such as those in the possession of the paramount chief I Arrangements were made to commence home Bible studies. The paramount chief’s uncle is now busy studying some of the literature given him by the chief I And yet all the literature is banned and the high commissioner’s office will not raise the ban!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It seemed advisable during the year to move the branch office from Blantyre to Salisbury, and this to good advantage. The capital of Southern Rhodesia is in Salisbury, and that is where the legislature gathers regularly. When the matter of subversive activity came up it was possible for some of the brethren in the branch office to talk to some of the legislators about the Society’s work. A letter was furnished to one of the legislators and this letter was written into the record. Many righteously disposed men were glad to have the true information about Jehovah’s witnesses. The papers then began to carry articles about how the Communists were treating our brethren in Eastern Germany. The convention came along with the resolution of Jehovah’s witnesses against communism. All of these things began to help the people to see that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a subversive organization, but that they are Christian people trying to help others gain a knowledge of God’s Word. It was a decided advantage to be in the capital of Southern Rhodesia during these discussions by the government on subversive activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch servant sends us </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> report of what is happening in the field, and some of the interesting items are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few weeks of the new service year had passed by when Brother Knorr gave us a gentle prod about moving the branch office and missionary home to Salisbury, the capital of this colony. So two of the missionaries went there and with the Lord’s blessing secured better premises for the Society in the capital. This move resulted In much good. The small European company there which had been able to work only a small proportion of the town now had the assistance of the four Gilead-trained missionaries. The result was that the publishers increased in number from 6 to 23 In less than a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Note the quick response of the people of good will contacted by one of the missionaries. He says, “One day last March while doing street work I was approached by a woman who asked me if I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She told me how she and her husband had been looking for us for four years. I took the address and went to see them next day. Mr. R---- took all the latest books and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subscribed for both magazines. He told me he had studied with one of Jehovah’s witnesses for about three or four months before coming north to this country and he wanted to get the studies started again right away. Since then he has been inviting in his neighbors and we have had as many as 12 at the study. Since he was so keen about the truth it was decided to ask him if we could have a public meeting in his home. He readily agreed. The meetings were a great success, with as high as 19 attending the first time. Now Mr. or rather Brother R---- has been a publisher since</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May. Two others have asked to go into the service with us and all are making plans to attend the Bulawayo assembly in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The other experience was the result of the door-to-door</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">work where I called on a lady who said she and her husband belonged to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> people. Apparently she had subscribed for the magazine at her previous home. Her husband enjoyed it but she wasn’t very much interested. However, she Invited me back to see her husband. When I did I easily started a study with him. She, although she listened, did not take part in the study. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out she was gathering her friends together and telling them the things we were talking at the study. She says, ‘I get all tangled up about 1914 and I suppose I get them confused, but I told them if they would come to the study that you would explain it to them.’ Her next-door neighbor told me emphatically she had no interest in our work when I called there, but, due to the witnessing of Mrs. B----, this neighbor is now coming in to the studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and thinks they are wonderful. Mrs. B---- says when I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">called on them the first few times she was a bit ashamed to let her neighbors see me come in, but now she just cannot keep from telling them all about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Interest scattered off the beaten track In the colony Is also manifesting itself. Up till now we have not been able to cover this sort of territory, but time is flying and the Lord has helped those scattered people of good will by means of the native publishers. European people of good will have asked native publishers to help them study the Bible and even hold a Bible study with them. In this land of an effective color bar this is very unusual, but it shows that the Lord’s sheep recognize the voice of the Good Shepherd and respond to It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So it has been a very interesting year. Progress has been made all along the line. We feel confident of the Lord’s blessing on our efforts and we are glad to share with our faithful brethren in other lands as we unitedly promote the worship of our God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark257"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While the Surinam lady washes the family clothes with a corncob for a scrubbing brush, and the British East Indian neighbors are doing the same thing by striking the wet and soapless clothes with a flat stick as the clothes lie on a sheet of metal, Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house preaching the gospel. Surinam is a land where one finds all kinds of people, from many parts of the earth. In the better parts of the city of Paramaribo you find a civilization similar to that in Europe. But as you get into the outlying sections you find a poorer class of people with more primitive ways of carrying on their daily occupations. But these are people to be witnessed to with the good news of the Kingdom, whether the season be rainy or whether the hot sun beats down on one all day. Jehovah’s witnesses press on persistently, knowing that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached. And the missionaries and company publishers in the land are working together to advance true worship. The branch servant in Paramaribo gives us a report of what is happening there now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the work of the Lord is full of joy and many blessings to the faithful publishers of the Kingdom, there are many trials which test the faith and devotion of all His people. It seems that during the past service year the publishers in this land have had their share of testing in company with their brethren throughout the world. One thing that has helped a great deal in the local company was </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on love and its expression. From that time on there was a noticeable change in the dealing of the brethren with one another. We hope that always we will become richer and richer in this essential quality so that unity will never again be seriously interfered with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the months rolled by indications began appearing which did seem to show that better days were just around the corner. As we would go from door to door the change in the attitude of the people became clearly discernible. It was nothing that you could put your finger on, but just as in the past we had always been able to find in a morning’s work one person who seemed to manifest sheeplike qualities, now we found the same, only more so. It does not seem to be merely a willingness to listen, but a thirst for the truth, and, of the ones who have had an opportunity to study thus far, quite a few are showing that they are willing to get in there pitching too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We heard about one experience that can teach us many things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Years before, in the year 1918, a younger man had symbolized his consecration to do God’s will, and, much to his sorrow, from the very beginning he met with opposition from his wife. Advice from older brethren which he had sought showed him that it was necessary for him to remain with his wife and support his family in order to please the Lord. So for many long years the brother toiled by the sea, spending weeks away from home on the fishing grounds (and that means damp, and cold, and burning heat) to provide for his family. And he kept preaching. Recently he came home for a few days, now old and gray-headed, but still walking in the way of righteousness. Imagine his joy to find out that his wife was having a Bible study with one of the general pioneers. Later she told him: “You know you people are just like roosters . . . calling to the people and telling them it is time to wake up.” Some days following it was good to see man and wife attending the same Bible lecture. We hope the interest continues to grow, for his sake and hers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the general pioneers in particular have been doing good work. They are beginning to work more and more with the company publishers, training them to do the work more efficiently, and working hard in the territory themselves. One pioneer brother has been doing well in the field. He has been able to report an average of 23 studies over a period of months, a high of 28, and a peak of 128 back-calls for two months in a row.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, all this work Is beginning to bear fruit. The idea of encouraging a person to take part regularly in the service each week had been suggested, and now this brother was going to put the procedure Into operation with one of his Bible studies who had been out in the work once or twice before. He took him out in the work, and a short while later the man of good will was back at his door again. He said that any time it was convenient he would always be glad to go along. With the idea of weekly regularity in mind the pioneer said : ‘What about the same time next week?’ The man said: ‘Is there any need to wait so long?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So at the end of a very hard service year we see that the work is beginning to bear fruit. The report for August was 11 publishers higher than that for July, and July was a bit better than average also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We bow our hearts in thanks and praise to the great Giver of all good things. He has helped us through many troubles, and we are confident that many good-will people will soon be coming to help us and to render public service in the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark259"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>FRENCH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The country of French Guiana comes under the branch situated in Paramaribo. There is one brother working in this country. The reports that have been sent in by this lone individual show that he was spending an average of fifteen hours each month in the field service in the early part of the year. However, reports have come through of his illness and he has not been able to do much in the way of witnessing in the last few months. We sincerely hope that more assistance can be given to this brother in the preaching of the gospel In French Guiana. Maybe some day the way will open up for some individuals to carry the truth into this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The spirit of Jehovah works upon the hearts and minds of honest seekers for truth and righteousness. The active force of Jehovah God is an impelling force and unequaled power. The spirit of God directs his servants throughout all the world, including those in Sweden, to work in the interests of the Kingdom. Those who are ‘sighing and crying’ in this old world and who seek truth and righteousness and take their stand for the Kingdom receive of this spirit too and it quickens them in the service of the Lord. This quickening spirit is evident in that so many brethren become capable of conducting Bible studies, doing public meeting work, and engaging in all the other services that are open to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Sweden are happy with the results of the 1950 service year, and the branch servant sends in a good report, setting forth some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How to get certain areas worked and the interest properly cared for has long been a problem in Sweden. Last winter the matter was taken up in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and at circuit assemblies and any brethren whose work did not demand that they live in a certain locality were encouraged to see if they could remove to any of these places. Some responded, and here is an encouraging report which came to hand just at the close of the service year. A family of five had moved into a territory and started working it by calliug upon people who had shown some interest years ago, when pioneers worked there, and whose addresses the Society had furnished them. As a result, after five months there is a company of 14 publishers, and more are coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In door-to-door work in a small community four different families were found who rejoiced when they heard the good news and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">asked</span><span class="font4"> for help to study the Bible. After a couple of studies a series of six public lectures was put on. The only hall was refused them, so the meetings were held out of doors, although it was early in May, when it is still rather chilly up there. The attendance was never less than 40. These meetings made the Pentecostal preacher foam with rage and that congregation started to pray for rain to hinder the meetings. After three weeks with no result there finally came rain when the fourth meeting was to be held, but that could not keep the people from coming, equipped with raincoats and umbrellas, and they listened intently to the whole talk. After that the Pentecostal people ceased to pray for more rain !</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the last lecture in the series was to be given many had expressed their concern as to how they were now going to be taught, and they rejoiced when it was announced that one of the interested had offered his garage for a study meeting place and had already prepared benches for this purpose. The first study was attended by 15 and the number grew week by week. Even some of the Pentecostals started to attend. Their preacher then called in an “expert” to uncover the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses. By that time the whole community had heard what the Witnesses were preaching, and when they were told the usual old lies, they strongly protested. The speaker had specially objected to the Witnesses’ preaching without a charge, which he considered “an example that might in time endanger the whole nonestablished religious movement”. Some of the public then told him that he had now clearly shown that he was preaching in his own interest only and not in theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To get the interested ones to the assemblies has also proved a real help to get them to make up their minds and to start out in the work. A study had been going for a long while with a family where the husband had even known the truth for 12 years, although he always was more or less skeptical. After much persuasion the brethren got him to an assembly and thereafter he started to make progress. When the next assembly came round his wife was to attend and he to stay at home and care for the baby. The night before the assembly he called up the friends, however, and asked whether their daughter, who was to stay at home anyway to look after their farm, could not look after his baby also, so that he too might get to the assembly. When he got there he immediately started out in the advertising work in the streets and the next day he went from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theocratic ministry school is, of course, also responsible for much of this increase in the public meeting work, as more and more of the brothers are being constantly trained for this feature of the ministry. That the theocratic training is valuable, and appreciated also by people educated in the wisdom of “this world”, Is shown by the following: A boy of 13 was to give a lecture at his school, choosing his own topic, but the teacher was to see the manuscript beforehand. The boy was asked by the teacher if he had written it himself (the topic was: “The Times of the Gentiles”). “Yes, and I have also given it already.” To the astonished question “Where?” the reply came: “In the theocratic school”; whereupon he gave a full explanation of that arrangement. “Of course,” the teacher said, “you may give it, but aren’t you afraid that the other boys will tease you for it afterward?” “No, not the least. After all, they know already that I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” When the lecture was given the teacher was so pleased that he at once asked him to prepare another, now on the subject “Who Is Jehovah?” and the other boys now go to our young brother for advice and help when they are to give lectures in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A report on the service year’s activities in Sweden would not be complete unless some mention were made of the share some of us were privileged to have in the glorious assembling together of Jehovah’s people which took place In New York. A party of 61 were able to travel from Sweden and their most enthusiastic reports are already beginning to have some effect, and we are sure of more to come as the district assemblies are being held, when more full reports ■will be given.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To see how the Lord blesses his people calls forth deep gratitude from his servants. Observing the loving-kindness of Jehovah increases the devotion of his servants to him. They see their God as a Friend and Benefactor. The brethren in Switzerland have been blessed richly during the year, and they have put up a good fight for the service. They find at the close of the year an increase of 16 per cent, with a new peak of 2,394 persons serving Kingdom interests. The Society has a printing plant at Berne. This produced many publications during the year, not only for the use of Jehovah’s witnesses in Switzerland but also for the use of countries nearby. The circuit and district assemblies were most successful. The report of the branch servant shows that they have earnestly pushed the battle to the gate, and some excerpts from his report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year saw pioneers move into some solid Catholic areas. The results have been encouraging. Priest action brought court actions; pioneers being ‘run out of town’ by the police; clerical ‘warnings’ from pulpit and church magazine cries of ‘communist’ and efforts to intimidate the goodwill persons by threatening that the menfolk would lose their jobs if the witnesses continued to visit their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another area police and priests joined hands to frighten the sisters. The police continually questioned them. The clergy ranted and raved against the work. The sisters write: “All this activity combined with our persistent continuance of the work caused folk to be curious about the message. Bather than speak to us nt the doors where others might see them, they now asked us inside, behind the doors, where they listened to the message! Last Sunday one family agreed to their home’s being used for a lecture, and 10 persons were present and studies arranged for all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year many companies started street magazine work for the first time, often after overcoming much official opposition. That persistence is rewarded is shown by this report: “When on the street I offered </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> (German) to a man. He took it and then said he had some questions. ‘What is the greatest commandment?’ I mentioned Matthew 22:37-40. He was satisfied. ‘What is the most important message?’ ‘The Kingdom message,’ I answered. Then he said, ‘Well, if all mankind would keep these two commandments what would happen?’ ‘Why,’ I said, ‘we would have better conditions, but we could not bring in Kingdom conditions ourselves, only Jesus Christ can do that.’ He was struck with amazement, and then identified himself as a Protestant minister and gave his address. Now he is a subscriber and studying his second book in a Bible study!” So even the orthodox religious leaders can turn to the way of life. Truly ‘wisdom calleth in the streets’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Swiss report would not be complete without its legal report because for years the peddling and similar issues have been fought. But it is a pleasure to Include this year’s report, for it is one of victories for which we thank Jehovah. During the year 29 cases were reported of official and police action. Four cases came into court, three were decided in our favor, and the fourth, on the peddling issue, is now before the Swiss Supreme Court. All other cases were successfully withdrawn. Peddling is the most common charge, but several street witnessing difficulties have arisen, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last September, Zurich, the largest city, charged publishers with “collecting money” in the street work. The court accepted the lawyer’s plea that the work was purely ministerial. A similar charge of peddling and collecting was fought in Winterthur, an industrial town, where once again the strong arguments of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font4"> and our stand as ministers caused the court to give us the victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Zurich too was the scene of a postassembly battle. In June, 1949, just 24 hours before the assembly, the police refused permission to use placards. Believing we were in the right we used placards, surprising both police and citizens. Later the police pronounced a fine, but, after fighting the matter, the fine was canceled and another pending case involving local publishers in handbill distribution was also withdrawn. This opened up the streets of Zurich!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Increased pioneer activity in Catholic canton Schwyz produced a ‘case of the year’. Two pioneers stand accused of “breach of the peace” and “peddling”. Why? Because the priests had told the people that these dear souls were communists, against ‘the church’, and to report them to the police. The whole case had the features of a plot. It is not forgotten that some years ago this canton tried to permanently ban the work. On June 9 a 100 per cent Catholic court of 7 judges sat. A fine of 170 francs had been pronounced against the sisters. What could now be expected? Frankly, not much, for this court had always ruled against us. Openly they had said they did not want Jehovah’s witnesses. But that was not the issue, our lawyer insisted—“It is not whether Canton Schwyz wants these two Christian women, but the question is one of law whether their ministerial work is commerce or not.” “No freedom for these Christians in Russia—now what will Schwyz do?” After a two-hour recess the judgment came: Not guilty!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as this report is completed the news comes to hand that cases in Catholic Lucerne city regarding street work have also now been decided in our favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one hundred brethren from our little country who were privileged to attend the unparalleled assembly of God’s people in New York will, without doubt, infuse the companies with the enthusiasm they have brought back with them, and this will be especially apparent at the Basle district assembly just ahead. This will generate fresh dynamic forces which will move the brethren to united action, for, as so powerfully impressed upon us at the New York assembly, “for that the leaders took the lead in Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye Jehovah !”—Judges 5: 2, AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The service year opened in Thailand with an additional four Gilead graduates arriving there to help in the field service. Their first work was to study the Thai language, and they have been making good progress in overcoming this barrier. Two of the brethren who spent many years in Thailand were called to Gilead, and they finished their studies with the 15th graduating class. These brethren are now en route back home to aid in Theocracy’s increase in Thailand. The work is going along well, and the branch servant sends us some reports of interesting happenings in the land. There is still a lot of room for improvement so far as expansion is concerned, but the brethren are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to push ahead diligently during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in December our greatest weapon yet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> in the Thai language, arrived from America. It has been an immense aid in the Bible-study feature of the work and also in our door-to-door witnessing. The book was translated at the Bangkok branch, and matrices were pressed by a local firm, after which they were sent to the Brooklyn factory for printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nan assembly was very successful. The brethren contacted the governor and, after hearing about our work, he arranged for us to use the open-air meeting grounds in the center of the town for the public lecture. A record number of 58 publishers for North Thailand attended the Nan assembly, five companies being represented, which is noteworthy in view of the long distances and difficulty of travel. The publishers co-operated well in advertising the public lecture, and even the governor aided the advertising by instructing the village chief to beat a drum to inform all of the family heads that the lecture would be held. The results were gratifying, for more than 360 persons attended and gave rapt attention to the lecture &quot;Liberty to the Captives&quot; which was delivered over the sound equipment in English and translated into Thai. A baptismal service was held at the Nan assembly and six persons symbolized their consecration to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following week the Chiengmai assembly was held, attended by 42 brethren. The place arranged for the public lecture was the Buddha Nikome Pavilion, an open-air assembly place with benches and thatched roof, owned by a Buddhist association. Sound equipment and five thousand handbills were used to advertise the public lecture. The attendance at the lecture was the highest ever obtained in Thailand; more than six hundred adult persons crowded into the pavilion to listen to the speech being delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among those In attendance were the city judge, a newspaper editor, the minister of education, many Buddhist priests, and three American Presbyterian missionaries. The Buddhist association invited us to come back at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While many experiences were had by the Gilead missionaries and Thai publishers, from the company servant of Ban Pan, Thailand, comes an Interesting experience. This brother was invited to a “house warming”. Accepting this invitation he proceeded to take advantage of his opportunity to further the Kingdom Interests. Here was a large gathering of both Buddhists and nominal Christians. After obtaining permission from the householder to use the microphone to speak to the people, the publisher delivered an impromptu public lecture concerning the Bible prophecies and Jehovah’s provision of a new world. Afterward many expressed their appreciation for the wonderful message they had heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few months later a religious ceremony was in progress at one of the Buddhist temples in Ban Pan, with many people being present. Recognizing this as another good opportunity to give a witness, this same publisher asked for permission to speak to those gathered. This was granted, and he delivered a one-hour lecture on the subject “Who Is Your God?” Certainly this well shows that Jehovah’s blessings are always with us if we take advantage of every opportunity to explain the wonderful hope of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are many obstacles to overcome in Turkey. Many years ago, back in 1921, a law was put on the books that no new religious movement may become officially organized within Turkey. This has made it rather hard for Jehovah’s witnesses in Turkey to continue with their work; but by the Lord’s grace they do preach the gospel from house to house as they have opportunity. They meet with their friends and neighbors and conduct Bible studies. The Society has a representative in Turkey looking after our interests, working with the government and doing whatever is possible to try to get some recognition so that regular meetings may be held. Now small groups meet in homes and study together and preach the Word as they have opportunity. There was a very good increase during the year, the number of regular publishers jumping from 30 to 47, with a peak of 60 publishers one month. This has brought real joy to the brethren because they see Theocracy’s increase in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The representative of the Society there sends us an interesting report and the few items herewith are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What blessings of divine favor would the 1950 service year bring us in Turkey? Could another new peak of publishers be reached and could we rely and wait upon the Lord to bless and bring an increase as he had done in the past? Would there be less opposition to our preaching activities during the next twelve months? These and other questions were uppermost in our minds as we began the new service year in September, 1949; and, by the Lord’s grace, all have been answered in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opportunity was afforded us of visiting the Turkish Mohammedans with the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font4"> in their language; and thus many “other sheep” were contacted and witnessed to. One Moslem youth in the army became very much interested in the truth after hearing about the Bible and God’s purposes from a Jewish brother. He began talking and witnessing right in the barracks to his fellow soldiers. Some opposition was brought to bear, but he took his stand and we are happy to have him associated with us now in the Turkish unit of the Istanbul company. This brings to four the different nationalities associated with the Lord’s people in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Literature continues to come into the country in small parcels and thus the brethren have something to work with. Especially noteworthy is the fact that many Armenian persons are interested in the truth and they can be given something to read in their own language.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Excellent progress has been made in the country of Uruguay in South America. To the joy of all the brethren, they see at the close of the year a 33 per cent increase in the number of publishers. This means to them and to all of us that the “other sheep” are being gathered together. The publishers are very energetic, not only among the English-speaking people but among the Russians and people of other languages. The back-call and Bible-study work is playing a big part in bringing about the increase. They had a number of very interesting experiences. One publisher sees to it that he meets all the trains as they come through the small town in which he lives, offering the magazines to those in the trains. Because of this a traveler in the farming section received the truth and is now a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant has done a good work, and at the circuit assemblies many new publishers are encouraged to get into the field. New territories are being worked and some very interesting experiences have been sent in by the branch servant, showing what happens when they get into a new territory that has never been witnessed to before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three missionary homes operated during the year for nine months, but two were closed down in May and the furniture from them was stored in the other during the three months that sixteen delegates to the convention were in the States. Three missionaries remained to care for the one home. Now that the Gilead graduates have returned from New York, two new homes will be opened up in new territory. Our ranks will soon be re-enforced by the arrival of seven newly assigned graduates who have just recently received their permanent residence entry permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Uruguayan experiences are numerous. One of interest is that of two Gilead missionaries and a married couple who were special pioneers. They were assigned to a town that was a hotbed of religious sects (besides the Roman Catholic cult there were seven or eight others) and not one active witness of Jehovah, but one </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriber. The first week of preaching the Catholics came out to protect their flock, sending four Catholic Jesuit missionaries through the territory, collecting all the literature to burn it, calling in the books as bad for Catholics. Next the children came along the streets shouting at the sisters: “Christ is King! Down with the American Bible!” together with a priest in a car who cheered the rooters on with his horn tooting. Then the radio opposition that was staged was extraordinary. Demonstrations with a missionary who spoke Spanish with a strong American accent calling at a door. A woman answered and shut it with a slam. The radio commentator summed up the act lamenting what a pity that good Christians had to take such measures, but that they were necessary, as it was the only way one could protect self from these persistent foreigners. The daily newscasts announced that foreign girls were going from house to house and that all should be on the watch for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In short order the priest confronted one of the Gilead sisters while she was presenting the message to a group of men in a barber shop. Feigning ignorance of the work, he asked her: “What books are these that you have?” She answered, &quot;I think that you already know very well.” This started a discussion. The priest bragged of his wisdom from twenty years of hard study and tried to humiliate the girl because of her youthfulness. He snatched the Bible from her hands, saying that only he had the authority and capacity to interpret any scripture in the Bible. She then said that he should interpret Matthew 23: 9. The priest hurriedly looked it up and she insisted that he read it out loud for all to hear. In very loud tones he read it. For a moment he did not realize just what he had read, but suddenly he angered and said, “And, just what do you mean with this?” “That you should not be called father,” she responded. “But we do not command the people to call us father; they do it out of respect.” “Well, then you as a minister of God should reprimand those who give you that title, since it belongs only to God.” With this last the priest went out furiously, while the people who had listened now laughed and commented about it. One said, “You are the first person that I have ever seen in this town who silenced that priest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another part of town about this time the two native pioneers called on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> person who had many questions, such as: “Can one eat meat or drink matd tea? etc.” They answered Yes, that the Bible did not prohibit doing that. Shortly her husband arrived and she said to him, “Notice this, the Bible does not prohibit eating meat nor drinking tea!” “Look, this man preaches the Bible and yet is drinking mate, he is not like that Reformist who comes to teach you, who prohibits this thing and that. Finally, that which is most important of all, the Bible, doesn’t teach it.” They then used the opportunity to cite such texts as Romans 14:17, showing that the kingdom of God has nothing to do with our stomach. The husband accepted </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Let Ood Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and invited them to return another day to help him understand more. They returned and studied and today the man and his wife are both publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And many other experiences similar to these happened, and it is easy to understand why in nine months 23 publishers are active, with 40 attending the meetings and eight brethren enrolled in the theocratic school. Their joy is great and their gratitude to Jehovah is overflowing, that in such a short time he has blessed the company so much.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark266"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“Darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples.” That is the condition in Venezuela. The religious yoke of bondage has created a thick darkness over the people for years. However, the statement is also made in the Bible, “But upon you the Lord shall rise, and upon you his glory shall appear; and nations shall walk by your light.” Jehovah's witnesses in Venezuela are letting their light shine and many of those in this thick darkness are now seeking the light and preaching the Word with Jehovah’s witnesses. A marvelous increase is noted in Venezuela. During the year 1949 they averaged 91 publishers, but in 1950 they jumped up to an average of 224, with a peak of 353 for the year. This means that in the country of Venezuela there has been a 146 per cent increase in the average number of publishers. There are wonderful possibilities ahead of these brethren for increases in the 1951 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It took quite a while to get things started in Venezuela, but it appears that things are going now. The brethren are zealously pushing forward. The Lord’s people rejoice greatly in the knowledge that the truth is penetrating to the hearts and minds of the people of good will in this country. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the missionaries working with the Caracas company gave this interesting experience. “It is surely thrilling to have a person of good will come up to you after meeting and invite you to come and have a Bible study at her home. Some months previous I had talked with her away up on the mountain at a friend’s home, but could not locate her again. For seven years she had searched from church to church, never returning twice to one, but after this first evening in a Kingdom Hall she was well convinced these were the ones ‘doing the will of God’. We hadn’t had even two studies together when she and her husband and neighbor were all in the house-to-house work, street work and conducting Bible studies. The neighbor can’t read or write, nevertheless all three are ready for baptism in the near future.” So these people of good will have finally found the light in this dark country of Venezuela.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A high light of the year was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Morgan in January. Their first stop was in Maracaibo, and a two-day assembly was held for the brothers in Maracaibo, Cabimas and Lagunillas. Enthusiasm about this occasion ran very high among the brothers and many were on hand to meet the plane when it arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting was held Friday evening at the Mason’s lodge hall. For two days before the public meeting a radio station, “Ondas del Lago,” or “Waves of the Lake”, made announcements every half hour that this talk would be given and announced that its facilities would be used to broadcast the entire lecture. The hall was filled and some stood in the hallways listening. One hundred and thirty-two attended the talk. The day following the lecture a study was arranged with the lodge caretaker. He had enjoyed every word he heard at the public lecture. Another man who was in attendance requested literature several days later and help to better understand the Bible. He, too, now enjoys a study. Working in the field the Sunday following the lecture a woman was found who immediately recognized our work from hearing the broadcast. It was easy to place a book with her and easy to arrange a study with her, too. Jehovah opened the way for Maracaibo’s first real public witness and now the little company of publishers there are diligently making the effort to show their appreciation for their blessing by helping the people who heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next stop of Brothers Knorr and Morgan was in Caracas, and when they arrived there they found an assembly In full swing. Due to engine trouble when leaving Maracaibo, they arrived a few hours late, but in time to give their talks “Living Up to the Name” and “Preach the Word”, which were thoroughly enjoyed by 100 persons, including many of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes when we have service meeting demonstrations the brothers say, “Sure, it looks easy up front in the service meeting, but when we get out in the service it doesn’t work out so easy.” The circuit servant while serving a company in the interior reported an experience which showed that it did work out and very easy, too. The publishers were gathered together in the territory on a corner while the servant was giving them field-service instruction and a demonstration on how to present the book. Some curious fellows nearby wondered what was going on, so stepped up to hear. Instead of witnessing to a fellow publisher the servant turned to the curious men and continued his testimony. A book and several booklets were placed while the publishers watched. Then they went into the service convinced that the points that the servant used were practical, and so used them to good advantage in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have 17 native pioneers who are doing a good work in spreading the light in different parts of Venezuela. In the mountains of the Andes, on the prairies, and down next to Venezuela’s dense jungle we have pioneers who are preaching the Word. We also have 7 companies reporting. One company in El Tigre (which means “the tiger”) has increased from 5 to 51 during this year. At a recent baptism they immersed 20 at one time. In this company there are four pioneers who work hard under the hot sun day after day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present we have two missionary homes in Venezuela, with 16 Gilead graduates, but very soon we hope to start three more homes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It was back in 1946 that false charges were made against Jehovah’s witnesses, the government claiming that the action of God’s servants was inimical to the state. At that time eleven received sentences varying from one to fifteen years at hard labor, while three, those who were directing the work in Yugoslavia, were sentenced to death. This death sentence was later commuted to penal servitude for life. Of the fourteen who were put in prison back in 1946 there are eight still in prison, seven brothers and one sister. Since then another fourteen of Jehovah’s witnesses have been sentenced to penal servitude in Ljubljana. Of these latter fourteen, six have served their sentences and one sister was released because of illness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since these trials Jehovah’s witnesses of Yugoslavia have been declared dangerous enemies of the state and they are constantly watched by the police. It is with the greatest caution that the brethren are able to carry on the preaching activity, but it is accomplished and much good has been done during the past year. One of the Christian burdens that befalls Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia is to assist those who are in prison. The government does not look well to the needs of those it has incarcerated, and it is necessary for friends to bring bread, meat, fats and fruit to the prison to keep the prisoners alive. If it were not for the brethren looking after those in prison, it would not be long until they would perish. It was possible during the year to send some food packages into Yugoslavia from the outside, and this has been of some assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports come through that the brethren rejoice in the effort they have put forth and the share they are having in the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. They realize that they are still under the protection of the Lord, and this by his grace. They are determined to stand fast and sing his praises. There are many more people in Yugoslavia who want to hear the truth, and Jehovah’s witnesses there have indicated that in the year to come they want to gather them together. We heard that 150 were baptized during the year. As to the number actually preaching the gospel, It is hard to say; but we are quite certain that more than 400 individuals have taken a stand for the truth and are preaching the good news as they have opportunity. For figures that have been compiled concerning the work in Yugoslavia you can see the chart in the front of the book. While these brethren have an interest in our prayers, we rejoice with them in their faithfulness to the Most High God, Jehovah.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark268"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>IT IS ENDURANCE THAT COUNTS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Having read the reports of the brethren in different parts of the earth, we can only conclude that it is endurance that counts. It is certainly true that “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”, and he has blessed them richly. (2 Tim. 2:19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> He has protected them and has shielded them from the enemy. Why all this? So that the gospel of the Kingdom might be preached in all the world. Even though many of Jehovah’s witnesses are in concentration camps and prisons, even though bonds are put about them and they are forbidden to preach the gospel to those with ears to hear, these servants of Jehovah will continue to endure until their work is complete. When an individual knows what he is working for and appreciates that he may go through a few years of suffering and trial but that in the end the new world of righteousness will bring him all the blessings of life, he considers it all joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Master said: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.” (Luke 9: 62, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> When one starts plowing a field, he ought to stay with it until it is completed, not looking behind and going back to other pursuits, because if he does he certainly is not going to enjoy the blessings of the Kingdom. The man who plows must look ahead. He plans on the future. He knows that after the plowing seed must be planted, the new stalks cultivated and watered, and then he looks to God to bless his efforts. The workman has this in mind, just as Paul stated: “The man who plows ought to plow in hope and the man who threshes ought to do so in hope of being a partaker.” (1 Cor. 9:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> So it really requires faith and endurance to stay with the assignment one receives from the Most High God. But it is worth it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our interest in life is in seeing God’s work done as it pertains to the announcing of the Kingdom and the gathering of the “other sheep”. Time is moving rapidly. Every day we get closer to the battle of Armageddon. Even back in the time of Paul, he appreciated this, for nineteen hundred years ago he said: “Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide will, by Jehovah’s grace, press on shoulder to shoulder with all their brethren, appreciating that each one must do his part in order to continue with Theocracy’s increase. All the branch offices have expressed their joy in service and determination to press on, come what may, for we know that “God is with us”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren everywhere send their love to all of you in other parts of the field, and so do I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother and fellow servant working for Theocracy’s increase,</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark270"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark271"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">On October 1, 1950, the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a nonprofit corporation, was held in the Wabash Building, 410 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh 22, Pennsylvania, at ten o’clock in the morning. The president of the Society presided at the meeting, and the usual business was handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were two directors elected to fill the vacancies due to the expiration of their terms. F. W. Franz and H. H. Riemer were re-elected for a period of three years each. Some reports were made by directors of the Society and the meeting was then adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On that same Sunday afternoon Brother Knorr gave a public lecture at Pittsburgh at the circuit assembly which was being held in the city. A few weeks later the board of directors of the Society met in Brooklyn, New York, and the following officers were unanimously re-elected to carry on the Society’s affairs for the next year: N. H. Knorr for president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretarytreasurer; H. H. Riemer, assistant secretary-treasurer. Matters of business were also discussed, and in a prayer offered to the Lord thanks were expressed for Jehovah’s rich blessing upon his servants during the past year. All looked forward to a new year with added privileges of service. One and all were determined to share in Theocracy’s increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark272"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark273"></a>YEARTEXT FOR 1951</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—Revelation 19; 6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a joy that means to Jehovah’s servants! For centuries Almighty God has not been reigning as king of the Jews or of any other nation upon the earth. When the nation of Israel was under a theocratic arrangement with God, having Jehovah as its king, the people rejected him as ruler. They cried to their Lord in heaven and requested a mere man to sit upon an earthly throne to judge for them. This must have been disappointing and displeasing to many of the faithful Jews of that day, and was especially so for the prophet Samuel. It is recorded: “But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.”—1 Samuel 8:6,7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark274"></a><span class="font5">Things are changing, though. Now, in the days when men put their trust in earthly rulers and worship them, there appears to be a great crowd shouting to the Lord and calling upon Jehovah as their King. What has happened? A Theocracy born again? Yes, just that. The “Gentile times” have ended and the legal right for men to rule over humankind is over. Their day has ended. The rulers of this old, wicked world do not give up easily, nor will they submit peaceably to the reign of Jehovah God. They continue to cling to their power, but they will be ousted from their position and their kingdoms destroyed just as soon as the announcement concerning the kingdom of heaven at hand is given sufficiently throughout </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">276 </span><span class="font5">all the world. Jehovah’s chief servant Christ Jesus said that first this kingdom must be preached as a witness unto all nations and then the end of all of these nations will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses realize that we are now living in the “day of Jehovah”, that it is here. The vindication of his name is imminent; the battle of the great day of God Almighty is but a short time off. This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> good news to a great crowd of people who have been sighing and crying in this old world and who have now come out of it, seeking the rule of Jehovah God, the Great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a vision the apostle John heard the voice of a great crowd, and it sounded like many waters or the roar of a cataract; it demanded his attention. Not only that, so great was that crowd that when this voice was heard it sounded like heavy thunder rolling and roaring in the heavens. Listening to what was said in the vision, John understood what the voice of this great crowd spoke. They said: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” The Theocracy was here to stay and to increase. That vision is now undergoing fulfillment, and it is now our privilege to join in the voice of the great crowd making this royal announcement to all the universe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God is a wonderful provider. He has given humankind everything they need. From the very beginning when he created Adam and Eve and placed them in Eden he provided them with a beautiful home in a paradise. He did more than that. God did not make his first earthly intelligent creations hunt for food to keep them alive. No, that was all provided for too. (Gen. 1:29) With all these provisions, they should have had suf-</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark277"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing efficiency in study serves to enhance the value of time so spent. While reading the Bible from cover to cover will undoubtedly broaden one’s appreciation of the truth, knowledge is accumulated more rapidly by employing the topical method of study. Information gained through individual study, ‘line upon line and precept upon precept,’ provides a backlog of information from which to draw when discussing the Bible with others. In rethis oppressive world and unspeakable blessings in the free new world. When ancient Babylon was thrown down, God showed his almighty power but did not then begin to reign over all the earth. It is when he has actually begun to rule as king that he does overturn and destroy great mystic Babylon of world-wide power. The first place at which an antiJehovah kingdom was set up after the Flood was Babylon or Babel. How appropriate it is, therefore, that when Jehovah overturns mystic Babylon he should be announced as ruling as king! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ficient. But even after the first pair sinned, God provided them with clothing. (Gen. 3:21) Since that time nearly six thousand years ago, man has needed these three things— shelter, food and clothing—in order to carry on his normal existence. With these he should be content. In providing all the necessary things in abundance God was not making man an idler. No, God kept man busy from the time of his creation, when He put him in the garden “to dress it and to keep it”. (Gen. 2:15) So it will be with man in the new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">cent years God has provided so bountifully for his servants that some may be prone to take the spiritual food for granted. The danger exists among Christians to forget that the adversary has not yet completed his days of roving about the earth seeking whom he may devour. Is it not possible that Satan may again do as he has done so many times in the past, withhold the Bible and kindred publications? In such an event, time set aside to fix God’s truths firmly in mind through study will have been profitably spent.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The U. N. has become a graven image that stands for man’s power and achievement and it is hailed as the world’s salvation.

When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.” (Eccl. 5:3-5) Christians do not merely assemble for a few minutes one day a week in a besteepled building and pay some titled cleric to preach to them. Each and every Christian is a minister and must preach to others. They make effective use of printed Bibles and Bible helps, using writing also to preach. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have faith and the knowledge upon which to base it, they would surely not receive the spirit. Certainly without proper knowledge none could work in a manner pleasing to God; none could bring forth fruits to the honor of Jehovah’s great name. Why do we work? It is because of our faith and because we believe God’s promise that he will give us life.

Twentieth-century men who persist in idol-building might with great profit note how God was provoked to anger and moved with jealousy because of the graven images to which Israel gave praise, and how he gave that nation of old over to ruin.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ understanding enabled him to appreciate clearly that Jehovah’s way of inviting men of good will to submit themselves to his principles as revealed in Christ Jesus for their transformation, and his way for thus having his law written in their hearts, was the best and only proper way.

But more attend and a greater variety of comments stimulates his own mind to activity and remembrance of things previously learned. Sharpened by these contacts with others of Jehovah’s witnesses, the new person is keen on going to the larger congregational meetings held at the Kingdom Hall.

Stress must be laid on the apostle’s words “go on acquiring power”. Quite evidently, then, God’s power will not just fall on us like a coat, equipping us to do mighty works, but rather something has to be done by each individual to strengthen himself in the Lord. Much time in study has to be spent that one may learn the source of power, who has already obtained it, and how he did so. Every Christian wants to be a valiant warrior of the Lord and do his holy work without fear. So acquire power. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ries of temptations which Jesus met in the wilderness covers the various ways in which the Devil approaches God’s servants, through the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the showy display of one’s means of life, in an effort to turn them aside from faithfully serving Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Caesar was military conqueror of Palestine and held the Jews in subjection, but, just the same, his servants were exercising governmental functions. They provided many public benefits from their administration and kept the peace and public order. So for such social, economic and administrative benefits and services, even oppressed, liberty-loving, independence-seeking Jews were obligated to pay back to Caesar what belonged to him. Part of the tax money he the only true God, and also the knowledge of the Chief Agent which he uses for making this life possible to us, Jesus Christ. When we study man, we are studying a dying creature. When we study God, we are studying the life-giving Creator. Certainly it is more vital to get acquainted with the Creator and get into relationship with him than to study sinful humans condemned to death. It is more important to get to know his Chief Agent of life than interest ourselves in men who need life and cannot save themselves. The higher study leads to eternal life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vine protection and salvation for them to life everlasting. By them he has not left himself without living testimony in this world. They give him the glory in harmony with his own affirmation: &quot;I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isa. 42:8, AS) He is a God of purpose. The meaning of his unique name is “he causes to be”, and so he creates all things according to his purpose. He is able to carry out his purpose, and his word never fails. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

The denarius coin was of his make, and not that of Jehovah’s theocratic government. Its image and inscription identified the political taxing power, and it was in this coin that the tax was to be paid. So for the beneficial services Caesar dispensed the subject peoples were to pay him back, even if he overcharged. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

There they were begotten by God’s outpoured spirit and became spiritual Israelites, or Jews inwardly. Would not this mean, then, the introduction of new systems of things?

But all things are from God.” Such a thing as this “new creation” in union with Christ the Head had never existed before, no, not in all God’s universe. So it could not be otherwise than that new systems of things should be introduced, and these in connection with the Christian “new creation”. Such new systems were introduced.

Delivering his sheep from all these evils Jehovah sets them in good pastures amid the Kingdom heights of his mountain. He has gathered the “remnant” and their companions out of the far countries of Christendom where they were scattered.

So it is that now the “other sheep” come in on the tail end of the gospel-preaching, after it has been going on for nineteen centuries and after the death of the antitypical firstborn of Satan’s organization. They rejoice that the closing “gleaning” work they do contributes so heavily to gathering in the “great crowd”.

We must meditate on those things and apply them denominations?” However, the things we teach are from God’s Word, and we are commanded to “preach the word” by a higher authority than what any earthly systems civil or religious possess. Jesus gave the command, and the apostles confirmed the same. That this command may be carried out, the Watchtower Society maintains the Bible School of Gilead, where hundreds of missionaries are instructed and thus equipped to go to foreign lands to “preach the word”.

By meekness will instruction come, and the faithful disciple will always be found waiting on God and seeking his will.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Probably almost everyone in Christendom knows of the law which God stated concerning the sabbath; yet very few have looked upon it also as a direct command from God to work.

Religious systems may deny these are Jehovah’s witnesses. Yet if they have the evidence that they are honored vessels of God’s visible organization, the reproach and opposition of worldly religious systems does not matter. They stand unmoved on a solid foundation : “For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal, ‘Jehovah knows those who belong to him.’ ” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” (Rev. 19:6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That explanation places before all the people and their earthly governments the paramount issue of all time, the universal sovereignty of the Most High God. That is to say, Who will rule the universe as rightful sovereign? For 2,520 years, the length of the seven “appointed times of the nations”, the rightful universal Sovereign, Jehovah, was not ruling any part of this earth, not even the so-called Holy Land of Palestine. But this is not so since 1914. Worship him now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of their time would be devoted to working. Jesus showed it was not a violation of God’s Law, which he kept perfectly, for anyone to do good works for the benefit of others on the sabbath day. Rather it was in keeping with God’s principles to do works of righteousness every day. When Jesus freely cured a man on the sabbath day, he said: “My Father has kept working till now, and I keep working.” (John 5:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The ending of the sabbath law with its command to work as well as rest did not change God’s principle that creatures should work.

It is not that Jehovah’s witnesses as people are any different. Most of them were at one time apathetic and listless members of orthodox religious congregations.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ perfect knowledge, wisdom and understanding did not come automatically to him. He had to get it by study, meditating and prayer, even as we. (Deut. 17:18-20) His faithful course in this respect is set forth as an example for us to follow. His reasonings and conclusions are based upon a perfect understanding of the divine will, and are entirely foreign to human methods of reasoning. Most of his conclusions are entirely different these truths. To have complete trust and implicit confidence we must make these truths our own, a part of ourselves, so to speak, and then we shall be able to obey the injunction, “Stand firm, therefore, with your loins girded about with truth.” (Eph. 6: 14. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking one with another cannot be accomplished by remaining at home or by only reading the Scriptures.

It must be given precedence over our own or any other creature’s conclusions. We must be transformed by making our mind over to conform to God’s mind as expressed in his Word, before we can have real knowledge, wisdom and understanding.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s attributes are power, wisdom, justice and love. The Scriptures say that all power belongs to him and that he is thus the source of all power in the universe. His wisdom is perfect; he does nothing wrong. Everything he says or does is right. The wise One, he is the source of wisdom. (Ps. 62 :11; 33: 4; Prov. 2:6, 7) He is just and is the beginning of justice. His decisions are righteous and fair.</span></p>

Did he burn out depraved Sodom and Gomorrah in a fiery downfall without warning? Did the Almighty take Egypt unawares as he sent wave after wave of destructive plague through the land?

And what of the desolation that struck Jerusalem during the first century A.D., did that blow fall without warning? To each of these questions the facts shout the answer, No! Out of consideration for man’s perishable frame of flesh Jehovah God sends his warnings by messengers in human form, messengers that the warned ones can comfortably listen to and question for details. Of this practice he says: “I spoke to you early and late, but you would not listen, . . .

So if there was to be a new high priest of God with a sacrifice removing sins, and if Messiah of the tribe of Judah was to be this High Priest, then there must be a new covenant. Christ Jesus was made High Priest by the sworn oath of Jehovah God, and then he was given to be the High Priest of the new covenant. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Now we have the privilege of developing ourselves through the many experiences and tests that come upon us. We are, as it were, perfecting our work, polishing out the defects. As we see our work improving we receive much joy. We rejoice in doing God’s will. With this perfecting of our service comes the knowledge that we are doing what is right. Thus God destroyed. The righteous new world will be here with Jehovah as the living, true God and with the perfect Governor whom he puts in authority over all the earth. But till the war of Armageddon removes Caesar and all his henchmen and his commercial and religious allies, Caesar has to be taken into account even by persons who are no part of this world but nevertheless living in it. Jesus said: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” As long as this world lasts Jesus’ words here apply.

A wise person, accepting the clear Scriptural proof of the time in which we live, finds out what to do and when to do it. So doing, he need not fear the expression of God’s judgment upon him. “A wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.” (Eccl. 8: 5) Manifestly, if the old world is soon to go to destruction, a wise man knows that he cannot spend his time as the world does. In the short remaining time it is God’s will that all men learn of him and gain life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">pays us with the freedom that comes only from having a clear conscience.

By taking the course of righteousness we receive many blessings and we are privileged to show by our upright conduct that those who abuse us have all the shame. When we stick to the work of serving God and when we stick close to his organization we may suffer persecution, but God grants us the strength and ability to bear it. There is joy in suffering for doing right. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

They do not use orthodox must have an honest heart, desiring truth and righteousness. That does not mean to say it is not necessary today for a man to study God’s Word, for as the disciples had to learn from Jesus, so we today must learn from the Bible. It would be impossible to answer any man concerning God’s works and the hope you have in his promises unless you applied yourself to study of what God has written concerning himself. You must always be ready to give an answer for the hope that you have in order to stir up faith in others. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">—1</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pet. 3: 15. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

Hence if you speak to them in a bossy voice, a stranger’s voice, they will not respond. (John 10: 3-5, W) So meekness and humility is the rule governing Jehovah's sheepfold ; and all in it, under shepherds or servants included, must obey such rule.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Luke 12: 31, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus advised his servants to seek first the Kingdom, promising that the material things would be added. Seeking the Kingdom first means one would have uppermost in his mind at all times the Kingdom interests. Such one would be looking for opportunities to serve in its behalf, and not be forever seeking first his material needs and laying up worldly goods to safeguard his future. To be sure, not all will be able to take up the full-time ministry.</span></p>

Hence we must become Jesus’ disciples </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">learners. We cannot gain entrance into Jehovah’s school of success unless through Jesus. (John 14:6) As Jehovah taught Jesus that he might teach others, so we too, after ourselves being taught, must teach others. God’s bringing us into his school is for an unselfish purpose. It is not a school where mere theory is taught, but it is a most practical school. We attend there that we may learn to do his will and may teach others for them also to win life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the earth and the birth of the kingdom of his Christ. The events of history show they became so right at the crucial date of 1914. They engaged in world war between themselves for world domination instead of acting like Christians and yielding over their earthly power to Jehovah’s enthroned King. In the thirty-seven years since then their wrath has not lessened but has increased, this being proved by their increasing persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. Nevertheless, we will continue to announce his kingdom by his Christ and to represent it as ambassadors. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet this advice applies just as much to those who find it necessary to engage in secular activities for financial support. By seeking continually to serve the Kingdom as opportunity affords, many have seen their way cleared for entry into the pioneer service. Thousands nave taken advantage of such opportunities, and, no doubt, there are now associated with companies of Jehovah’s witnesses thousands more who could become pioneers if the privilege were sought after more earnestly. Part-time work to help is proper. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

But how could the Kingdom be given into the slave’s custody? Certainly it could not be that part of the Kingdom in heaven itself, for the anointed remnant is yet on earth. We find that this is exactly what edge is of very little value. This is particularly true when it comes to apply the knowledge we have of God, his kingdom and his law. It is possible to have wisdom and still not have understanding. We might decide upon a proper course to follow. We may have dedicated ourselves to serve Jehovah, all of which is a wise procedure; but, in addition, we must get understanding. As sons he reveals to us the why and wherefore of the things we need to know.

They manifest their love of God and their fellow men by declaring God’s purposes to all the people of the whole world in the same primitive manner as did Jesus Christ and his apostles. In 1931 they declared to the world their determination to be identified by this God-given name and by none other.

That is, those Kingdom interests which are visible. Can it therefore really mean that the returned Master who comes as earth’s new ruler has made this faithful and discreet slave caretaker over all his possessions? That is exactly what it states, and certainly no less. “He will appoint him over all his belongings.” Not only do we believe this, but give thanks to God and Christ day and night for his loving-kindness to children of men. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

So then, there is the publishing of the good news, talking to those outside our companies, the people in general, yes, going from house to house, then making further visits until the interest is kindled into a desire for study. The oftener Jehovah’s children converse together and carry this news to others, the more pleasing it is in his sight. Is it not a fact that those who attend meetings</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These words were addressed to God’s “woman”, Jehovah’s theocratic organization called “Zion” which brings forth those who become the spiritual children of God.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Tribulations met with in their service of God and the persecutions they must undergo for preaching the Word dry up their fruit-bearing possibilities. They are stumbled by this fiery tribulation and persecution and take offense at it, rather than being convinced that such an experience marks the right side and proves they regularly, take an interest in the ministry programs and in the actual preaching service, who are present at every session of their circuit assemblies, are the ones who are most lively, always discussing the truth, eager for any opportunities and privileges of service? Are they not always talking about their back-calls, their studies, or how someone has been aided in the service? They have no time to spend doing anything else, but keep themselves free from old world pursuits in order to be willing slaves of the Lord Jesus.

How precious it is to have Jehovah God himself for our Teacher I There could be no education higher than this, for it is a receiving of knowledge from the highest source in the school of life. And God has called into service as his fellow teacher his Son Jesus Christ: “for your Leader is one, the Christ.” So we must be taught by Jehovah through him.— Matt. 23: 8,10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW.

(Acts 5:41, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">They forget that Jesus foretold that tribulation and persecution would come upon them for faithfully copying him and his apostles. They let God’s Word go in only so far and then let some impenetrable thing like a rock-layer prevent its roots from going down deeper and pulling good qualities of courage and faithfulness to the surface. They prove weak-hearted. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To preach requires faith, but not much. As little as a grain of mustard seed will move a mountain. Less than even that little hit should move us into field service, we are so much smaller than mountains! None should need to be driven by others or by themselves to be active in witnessing.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A person who thinks he can get along without God’s organization and can study the Bible on his own and can do God’s work independently as he thinks best apart from all organization is very foolish. He lacks all understanding of how God has dealt with his servants in times past. We must not forget that God instructs us through his organization, his woman, our mother. gregational meetings, listen to the comments of others. Take in the tnith through eye and ear till it fills the mind and heart, till it wells up inside and overflows out the mouth in field service. It will do this of itself. We talk of what is in our mind and heart. Some gossip, carry tales, air family troubles, or nag or complain or quarrel. That is what fills their mind. What is on our mind we want to get off. So get the truth on your mind, and then get it oft your mind in your witnessing territory! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">nothing but the gift of life God gave him, and he can take nothing along when he leaves it. When one knows this, why-should he crave to domineer over and control the lives and destinies of other human creatures? Why be greedy and have that selfish condition of heart? If, as we know, God supplies all things to sustain our life, why try to take away the substance God has given other men for their existence? It ■would be better to give our substance to the poor than to covet what little they have. What is our gain if we do rob the poor? We certainly cannot take it with us! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He respects his woman and appreciates the work she does in behalf of His sons and daughters. So he does not like it when any professed Christian disrespects the “mother” organization. To disrespect her means to disrespect Jesus Christ, for God has made this beloved Son the head of the theocratic organization. He who robs the organization of the respect due this symbolic mother is working to destroy the organization, not build it up. He is guilty of transgressing against her divine husband, Jehovah our heavenly Father. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How could this be true of worldly political governments? There those in official positions are put in by popular vote, by machine party-politics, by dictatorial seizure of power, by executive appointment, by hereditary law of a dynasty, by legislative action or parliamentary appointment. God is not manipulating worldly politics like a political boss. It is only within his theocratic prison-houses, where they have been held in bondage by ignorance and superstition. The work of gathering is expanding rapidly, as the anointed and their ‘‘other sheep” companions go forth with the Kingdom message to all the nations. This is cause for much happiness, for the Kingdom is established in the heavens and this truth is being proclaimed to the people that they may find comfort and hope and may escape from the orthodox religious systems. We have much opposition and many trials, but none of these move us, for we are determined to finish God’s work with joy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

He will rule through the theocratic government of his Son, Jesus Christ the King. That kingdom will institute new systems of things, the ones the Bible speaks of as yet coming. The very establishment of God’s kingdom in the heavens by enthroning his Son in 1914 resulted in a radical change in the activities of God’s spiritual children who were under the new covenant. It has marvelously altered the message they preach for a witness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">organization that the existing authorities stand placed in various positions with relationship to one another by God, as Romans 12 : 4, 5 and 1 Corinthians 12 : 12-28 show. Rightfully Jehovah God has reserved for himself the position of Supreme One of the “superior authorities”. He shares that position with no one else. Whom, then, has he placed next highest with relation to himself? Jesus Christ, who proved bis loyalty to his heavenly Father to a violent death in the midst of Satan’s hostile world.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Melchizedek of Salem represented Jehovah as King. Centuries later Jehovah Goa began reigning over Israel as King.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah, who has a time for every purpose, has set this time aside for the preaching of the gospel, and men must be the preachers. At Matthew 24 :14 Jehovah caused his Son to emphasize the fact that gospel-preaching would immediately precede the final end. It is such a privilege to have a share in this activity that the Scriptures indicate that even the angels in heaven would rejoice at the opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan tries to make the things of this world appear alluring to those in God’s work. There are many lusts of the flesh which war against the spiritual things. There are pleasures of this life which can be allowed to take up all our consecrated time. If we have plenty of this world’s goods we may become afraid takes faith to recognize he is now the ruling King over his people and is to be obeyed as such. But the Israelites showed we are sure to suffer if we reject or fall away from that faith. In the days of the prophet Samuel they asked him to make a visible king over their nation to correspond with kings of this world. Their last human king was taken away in divine wrath when Babylon’s armies destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C. Dike him, the last kings and princely rulers of Christendom will be taken away in God’s wrath at Armageddon amid great tribulation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Pet. 1:12) They do not feel it beneath their dignity or a waste of time to uphold Jehovah as the sovereign of the universe and make it known that his King, Christ Jesus, is enthroned. Yet this privilege is reserved for men ; but even if every man were to fail to preach it would still be accomplished, for Jesus declared that if his followers should hold their peace then “the stones would cry out”. (Duke 19 : 40, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> So Jesus set the proper pattern.

Paul wrote: “Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessa-lonica.” (2 Tim. 4:9,10) Demas had great opportunities of serving God in company with the apostle Paul but lost out because he did not stick to his work.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Nothing escapes Jehovah’s eye. He takes note of faithful, loyal service. Never does an act escape him. His eye never sleeps and he is ever watchful for the best interests of his children.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus is closely associated with Jehovah in the teaching work. He taught in the homes of the people when he was on earth.

They study the Bible, talk of it, and obey it, because they know it is God’s Word. Their studies include reviews of the acts of faith and fearlessness of God’s servants in ages past, and they believe that the same God who did wondrous works then is the same one we know and serve today.—Ps. 48: 14, AS. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">today cling to the methods established by their Exemplar, Christ Jesus.

Jehovah God blesses the home Bible study, and Christ prospers even such a small gathering, according to his promise. (Matt. 18 : 20) Hence as the zealous witness conducts the home study in an orderly manner, the real Teachers, Jehovah and Christ, enlighten the eyes of understanding of the meek student and cause the divine purpose to unfold for the learner. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">should plan their congregational meetings or other course of action to build up the weak points and to protect the concerns of Jehovah’s organization committed to their charge. They should so conduct themselves as the divine Word instructs. The same planning and correct conduct would apply also to a Bible study held at the Kingdom Hall or in homes of interested people.

Very soon a final judgment in the great issue of Jehovah’s supremacy must be rendered in the greatest court in the universe, the court of Almighty God. Jehovah’s witnesses have been designated to give testimony concerning that great controversy which Jehovah has new earth that God makes for man to inhabit. Both are attained through true riches; so store up for yourselves treasure in heaven. If you would be rich toward God, use your possessions and your knowledge of Jehovah God and his righteous government on behalf of the poor and comfort all that mourn, with the good news of God’s kingdom. Do not let yourself be tied down by your wealth and become a slave to your possessions, but make your possessions work for you m your preaching of the Word.

It is possible for you to devote a little time each week to considering God’s Word as it applies to these times; and it is possible for you to set aside some time tor giving praise to God. But there must be the desire on your part and the determination to take the God-approved course, by his grace. TV </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3/1</span></p>

One who witnesses to Jehovah’s supremacy is a Christian. His witnesses follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, which entitles them to call themselves Christians. The author of Christianity was a mighty witness on behalf of Jehovah’s supremacy. (John 18: 37) It is plain, therefore, that in order to bear the name of Christ and assume the name Christian one must first be a witness of Jehovah, as was Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

Guided by the wisdom from above, they have an unbroken string of victories over worldly nations that bristle with the latest war weapons.

That joy knows no limits. Then there is the destruction of this evil world, removing evildoers for all time. Oh, that the day might even be hastened! It cannot come quickly enough.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To enter Jehovah’s school of success we have to turn ourselves over fully to him, the great Conductor of the school. We have to submit ourselves fully to his course of instruction and be willing to learn according to his way.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God . . . has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.—Heb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1:1, 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God is the Maker of righteous systems of things. They are all under his supreme control. He has arranged them in an order that leads from one set of good things to better or grander things, at last reaching a height of goodness that leaves us with nothing further to be desired. He is a God of published by a proved instrument of God and Christ, the Watch Tower Society. By his irresistible power the light has broken through the devilish opposition and has reached us, and He “has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ”. (2 Cor. 4:4-6) Let us, in turn, rise and shine, reflecting the light on to others. If people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge, let it not be because of our negligence. If a great good-will crowd is now being led to salvation, let it be by God’s use of us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">days of this world are numbered, and all those who are studying and aiming for success in this world will pass out with it in destruction. But Jehovah God wants his students to find a permanent place in the free new world which he creates and which will never pass away. That is his desire for us who enter his school. (Matt. 18:14) He wants to have us attain to eternal life in the world to come, and he knows just the course of study, training and activity that we need for us to succeed. It is, therefore, essential that we obey his will as Teacher. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">10/1</span></p>

He will do this by means of his promised government in the hands of his glorified Son, Jesus Christ. By attaining this goal he will vindicate himself as Rightful Sovereign over all the universe. To this end he has made a series of systems of things to follow one another. His Son has a most important part in vindicating Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, and he has used him in making the systems of things. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Today a “great crowd” of persons “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” are offering praise to God in the proper way; and their ranks are constantly growing. (Rev. 7 : 9-17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> With Jehovah’s anointed remnant they lift their voices from every nation.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The light of understanding of God’s Word grows dim and blacks out of the mind of the one who carelessly fails to trade with the talent or Kingdom interests which are put in his hands. By bringing an increase or bearing fruit, Jesus meant helping others to understand and to become witnesses to the majesty of Jehovah, preaching tne Word of life.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">119:11, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is good to know about God’s promises; yes, go beyond merely knowing, memorize them if you will, so that they are always in mind for your comfort and guidance. Only those who have learned to actually trust in Jehovah know the value of being able to recall at will some of the precious statements he has made for those who love him. All goodwill persons must learn of these ing from door to door, repeatedly visiting the people with the Kingdom message, Jehovah’s remnant and their companions testify to the people concerning the Kingdom and its blessings. They call upon the people to join in praising God, because it is on this issue of praising him that men are now being judged. It is a great dividing work that is now in progress among the people everywhere, as Jesus foretold. Those who join in singing God’s glories are classed as “sheep” whose inheritance will be eternal blessings. Those who refuse are “goats” whose end is destruction. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W S/l</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God. “Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (Heb. 13:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The desire to instruct and help others which so fills one when one begins to learn of Jehovah’s gracious provisions is not to be shunted aside, ignored or drowned with worldly cares. When one accepts Christ as his Redeemer and devotes his life to do God’s will, his time is no longer his own to waste or squander. His time, yes, his very life belongs to God’s service. “You were bought with a price.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

Unless properly informed of Satan’s works they will not value the promises of the Almighty’s protection. For is it not a fact that those who seek righteousness and God’s honor become targets of the Devil? The way, then, to stay fearless to the end is to study the truth which is God’s Word; learn of his works toward men in times past; get to know who he is and understand his purposes. Study his Holy Record and be taught of the righteous new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W S/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">13:45, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus had a personal joy in fulfilling the purposes of his Father and receiving the promised reward.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The instruction and training that Jesus gave his early disciples compare with the ministry school and service meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses of today. Many of his discourses were service talks, urging his followers to let the light shine, preach the Kingdom gospel, bear fruit, baptize the new ones and start them off in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Friday, March 16 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Likewise these are the ones sown upon the rocky places: as soon as they have heard the word, they accept it with joy. Yet they have no root in themselves, but they continue for a time; then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, they are stumbled.—Mark 4:16,17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What an opportunity they miss to brand the Devil a liar in charging that God could not put on earth a man who would keep his integrity under persecution and tribulation by the Devil I For proving unfruitful, Christ and be recipients of its blessings, are also required to consider this privilege of inestimable value. They are re-?uired to follow a course of aithfulness like that of Jesus and his body members in order to qualify for Kingdom blessings. Therefore the ‘selling of all that he had’, this giving up everything in order to obtain that “pearl of high value”, is of vital concern to all the members of Christ’s body and to their “other sheep” associates. Our appreciation of this is enhanced by proper understanding. Whatever else you get, get understanding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">preaching work. He conducted demonstrations for the benefit of his followers, taking the lead in service and showing how the work should be done. Those with him observed the Master Preacher, learned from him and later gave others cause to recall this superb training. (Acts 4 : 13) When Jesus sent the twelve apostles out to preach, he gave them specific instructions on how to handle interest and opposition met in door-to-door witnessing. Later on he gave similar theocratic ministry training to seventy other disciples before sending them out to preach. They returned a report. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">they fail to gain new world life. Seeing, then, that tribulation and persecution are certain to come upon those among whom we sow God’s Word of the Kingdom, we should forewarn and prepare them for its coming. When it does come upon them in their early days before the message has had time to take deep root and be fruitful, we should stand loyally by them under it. Help them to endure it, watering them with the rain of God’s blessings that they may withstand the “heat”. We cannot do so by forsaking them to themselves. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ is nothing nationalistic. It is not Jewish or to be confined to the Jews only.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This all of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses do. Some are able to devote full time to the preaching work ; others can be only part-timers, having to do some secular work to provide their livelihood. There are circumstances that limit the activity of some, but all can find opportunities to share in the final witness. Physical ailments may incapacitate some, but even these can preach by word ilies of the earth be blessed. . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 12: 3; 22:18) The life-giving blessing through Abraham’s Seed, Jesus Christ, must therefore be spread to all nations, Jew and Gentile alike. Properly the blessing went first to the Jewish descendants of Abraham. But when that nation turned down the blessing, God acted upon his words to Abraham. He extended the blessing; through Christ to non-Jewish nations. God is no respecter of persons as based on nationality. Faith like Abraham’s is what counts. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the rich must put their trust in Jehovah and do his bidding and preach the good news of the kingdom of God. Can the rich, those with much of this world’s goods, do that? Is there any hope at all for them to gain life in the new world? If there is, what must they do? The Word of God tells us that we should be rich in good works, treasures in heaven. If one uses his wealth in the advancement of true worship of the Most High God, he is using his earthly possessions in the right way. Earthly possessions themselves do not give life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1 of</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> mouth to neighbors, to friends, to callers at the door or over the telephone, or by writing letters and sending literature through the rnaiE Ill health limits service activity, but should it halt preaching entirely?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus brought a ministry of work to the earth. The Father in heaven had sent him, providing him with a commission to do marvelous works while on earth. And so Jesus worked diligently throughout the time of his ministry. He devoted his talents and abilities exclusively to God’s work and purposes. After the disciples had witnessed his working, Jesus gave them direct commands to go out to cities and villages to do the work of preaching and teaching. He left no doubt nant. Really, these present-day “other sheep” correspond with the “strangers” of good will who lived peaceably and harmoniously within the city gates of the ancient Israelites under the Law covenant That old covenant made many provisions for such God-fearing strangers. In many things it had the same ordinances for them as for the natural Israelites. The modern-day flock of “strangers” sojourning within the gates of the new covenant arrangement have been greatly blessed with the spiritual remnant by obeying the same divine ordinances.—Ex. 20: 8-10; 12: 48,49. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">him, no one has the right to question the Most High God on how he uses his authority, even though for a time we may not understand it. He does what he pleases, but what he does is always for good, since there can never be any unrighteousness or untruthfulness in him. “The Almighty is beyond our minds. Supreme in power and rich in justice, he violates no right.” “Power belongs to God.” (Job 37:23 and Ps. 62:11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mo)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Unquestionably Jehovah is Chief of the Superior Authorities.

That their Christian work was to include missionary service in faraway nations was shown by the direct words of Jesus to his disciples concerning the work they were to do following his ascension to heaven. (Matt. 28:19,20) This was a clear command to go out to the people of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">nations.

This is something the passover lamb could not do, it being only a shadow. Jesus was the reality of that shadow. (Col. 2 : 17) The night of Nisan 14, A.D. 33,</span></p>

Seeing, then, that Jesus, who had such great potentialities in every field of human endeavor, chose to devote his time to the ministry of God, does it not. follow that our prime objective should be the same? Most assuredly! Jesus instructed any who sought his favor to ‘take up his torture stake daily and follow him’.

Never have they been found to bear the name of Jehovah falsely or to have assumed that name in vain. Unlike the clergy, they have never been false impersonators. They have borne Kingdom fruit, proving times ; and very often they are tired from the long hours of work they must perform to realize a reasonably comfortable existence. All the problems of life that you must daily face, they contend with also; and yet they study God’s Word to gain better understanding, and they devote some time to singing Jehovah’s praises. They are looking for the salvation God has promised, with its eternal blessings. They understand that not all one’s effort must be devoted to securing comforts in this world, nor should one strive to lay up treasure on earth as a protection against the future.—Matt. 6:19,20. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing our limitations and the power of our earthly cravings and the Devil’s alertness to help us gratify them, Jehovah has emphasized this matter of getting understanding in the Scriptures. He indicated it is very necessary to get understanding first; and when we have attained to that, we shall be able to appreciate that it would be foolish indeed to try to make the Kingdom with a lot of unnecessary accumulated burdens that are bound to obstruct our progress and to corrupt our affections. Show the wisdom from above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">where their heart is. “By their fruits you will recognize those men.” (Matt. 7: 20,2VW) True Christians do not emulate the clergy of today, who do not preach by calling from door to door. They emulate Christ. The people of good will and all the world at large can see who are the true witnesses of Jehovah. They have practiced what they preached. By living their faith they have shown to the world a mountain of evidence in indisputable proof that they are living up to the name. They personally carry God’s Word to people’s homes.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Part-time work to maintain one in the ministry is not to be frowned upon. That is exactly what the apostle Paul did in order that he might not be a burden upon those to whom he preached. Thus doing, no offense could be found against him, except it be found against the message itself. However, orthodox religions of this world do not look on this method</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible, or a knowledge of what is in it, is the fundamental piece of equipment for God’s visible organization. Bible societies of Christendom have distributed Bibles by the hundreds of millions of copies in more than 1,118 languages and dialects. Yet great ignorance persists as to its teaching. Sectarian confusion is bewildering as to its harmonious teaching. Jehovah’s word is not of private interpretation. He</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 3:12, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Bible Jehovah’s witnesses know what his name stands for. They know all the glorious history connected with it. They know all the divine promises, covenants and prophecies given and fulfilled over that name. They know, too, that every last one of the worldly nations will yet be made to know that name as belonging to the Supreme, Omwith favor. On the other hand. Jehovah’s witneses do not herd their congregations into elaborate cathedrals and confront them continually with a collection basket. These witnesses come from all walks of life, engaging in all trades of secular activities. Their first aim is to please God by faithfully fulfilling their consecration vow to preach. The amount of secular activity engaged in is governed by the circumstances. When it comes to storing up wealth for the future or for living in extravagance now, faithful Christians follow Jesus’ advice against it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is his own Interpreter. He causes light to be shed on one Scripture text by others elsewhere in the Bible bearing on the same subject. He also brings to pass the fulfillment of Bible prophecies by definite events and then he calls the attention of his witnesses to such fulfillments in clarification of prophecy. He has appointed Christ Jesus the Head of his visible organization and his associate interpreter for the organization. So his visible organization under Christ is a channel to bring the divine interpretation of his Word to his people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">nipotent God of the universe. Therefore they have enough faith, enough Christian respect, and enough childlike confidence to “take refuge in the name of Jehovah”. To them it stands for the only Rightful Government, for God’s Fatherhood of Christ the King, for our eternal deliverance from Satan's world. So we consider it a privilege to bear the reproaches which the Devil casts upon that name. We count it an honor to call upon that name, sounding it forth in praiseworthy language to all who long for God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thinking and talking about God and his purposes is good for you. Consider your limitations. You have a limited amount of time to give to the training of your mind.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">No one is so strong that he needs no added strength. So how is it possible to always be able to draw strength from Jehovah? The answer is that we must all live in the fear of him. The more we fear Jehovah. the less we shall fear creatures, conditions and tbe world with its wicked demons</span></p>

Like the Right Shepherd, they are even willing to lay down their lives for the sheep. (John 10: 11) Like the Chief Shepherd, faithful servants are willing to put the welfare of their brothers ahead of their own comforts. Willing to lay down their lives for their brethren, they are more willing used to build up a protective barrier against the darts of the enemy. Your thoughts can be filled with important ideas. Each day we have a text to consider, as published in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> You will find appropriate times to discuss theocratic matters when in association with others in public, witness work, or with friends in travel or at home. The wise Christian sets aside certain regular times for the building up of his mind, fortifying himself for the work to be done.—Phil. 4: 8,9. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and ruler. Jehovah is just, true, wise and loving. We fear him, so we love him. How is this possible? Then take the example of the human father, and remember that a child's love for parents is not one whit diminished by knowledge that disobedience and wrongdoing will bring some form of punishment. Good parents must discipline their children. With Jehovah it is a question of obedience or disobedience. He shows the way leading to life by obedience. Should we, then, not fear the Life-giver? The man is foolish who refuses to do so. Fear of him is a fountain of life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to go out of their way. to help weaker ones with their problems. If publishers create burdens for themselves and for the servants, then the servants, not begrudgingly, but gladly and out of love for the weaker members, offer to give aid and help as seems best under the circumstances. (Gal. 6:1,2) Unlike Christendom’s hirelings and false shepherds, servants in the theocratic organization spiritually strengthen tbe weak, heal the sick, bind np the wounded, bring back the strayed, seek out the lost lambs. It is not God’s will for one to perish. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As we are expecting to enter the new world in which righteousness is to dwell, then let us live in righteousness. We know the Lord God’s day is coming for the destruction of all those who are spotted and blemished with this world and not at peace with God. He will approve only those whom he finds spotless, unblemished and longing to the King, we may enter into, and the immediate future holds many more. This is our day of prosperity. Let us rejoice and be glad that now we are in it. (Ps. 118:23-29) Be joyful in the King of the new world. There has never been a time like this in the history of man, and there will never be such a time again. Share the King’s service now, and share the King’s joy. Now is the time to work hard and work with a will. The work is joyful and will continue so, bringing its increase in Kingdom interests. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">pie, they quickly start reflecting that light, letting it shine throughout the bedarkened world, lifting up their voices like a trumpet of praise to God, making sure that the blast is clear and certain, shouting with zeal the truths that make men free of harsh oppressors. The anointed remnant are likened to earthen vessels in which is stored the treasured light. To let this light shine they willingly consume and use up their bodily strength and even allow it to be broken in death like shattered clay pitchers. But their exemplary course impresses and the light increases to others. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in peace.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember: a farmer, if he wants to reap, cannot leave his fields, letting them go uncultivated after a sowing. He must work at his sown fields and keep off the destroyers of crops and must show patience, waiting long for his crop. (Jas. 5:7) We who are privileged to sow God’s Word must do the same thing in a spiritual way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">That is why it</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.—Heb.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2 .• </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Having studied and assembled with other Christians and thus gained knowledge is no guarantee that a person will always retain it. How disheartening it would be, after spending days, months or years in learning about God’s Word, to find that the knowledge had been taken away again by him who gave it! Much time would then have been wasted, indeed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s humble servant who is anxious to get understanding will meditate on Jesus’ example. First, he will note that Jesus did not choose his own course to follow, or select his own territory. He “was led by the spirit”. His own preferences and ideas of what should be done were not the important thing. The same attitude is in evidence as he</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot leave it all to those with whom the Word is sown as their responsibility, but must stay close by the seed sown and try to improve the soil thus seeded and help it become fruitful and help to counteract the invasion of Satan’s “birds”. Faithless unfruitfulness gains no salvation. If, then, we love eternal life in happiness, we do not want to be roadside soil to the great Sower. In our own case we have to beware of the Devil’s “birds” as well as soften our own hearts and minds toward the Kingdom message. (Jas. 4:7) Do not let your minds be the Devil's roadway and harden you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But such a thing need not happen, and the hest way to insure against it is to keep the truth bright through use. Jehovah has given a rich gift to those who gain an understanding of his purposes. “Do not be neglecting the gift in you,” said Paul. “Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:14,15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use must be made of the gift if it is not to be neglected and if all are to perceive how the servant has profited or advanced. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">met each issue raised by Satan. The big question was not that of supplying his own bodily needs, no matter how legitimate these needs might seem to be, or following a seemingly easier and more desirable way of doing his Father’s business. He had understanding. He knew his Father’s purposes. That understanding plus the spirit of Jehovah enabled him to understand and apply the scriptures properly that Satan had misapplied and to counter with scriptures applied according to his Father’s purposes. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It was not the divine purpose that the good news of God’s Word should be held down to those who could read the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek of the Holy Bible. Jehovah is a God of salvation for all humankind of whatever race, color, nationality or language. In fulfillment of prophecy, Christ Jesus was a Jew and all his apostles were Jews.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The great objective of all the schooling Jehovah gives through Jesus Christ is your succeeding in finally saving your own soul and helping in the salvation of others.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are the “other sheep” of today men and women of faith like Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham and Sarah?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet salvation by the sacrifice of his Jewish flesh was not for Jews only, but for all those of mankind who should believe on him. So Jesus gave full width to the vision of our Christian work when he said the above words to his disciples before parting. This meant translating the message of salvation into as many languages and dialects as the people of all such nations spoke. If the message was not translated, they could not understand it and act upon it in faith and obedience. The first translation of the message at Pentecost was spirit-inspired. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

Because e recognized that man-made governments did not derive their authority from God but were under the inspiration of Satan, he refused to meddle in them or take the headship over them. He refused to form a fusion government with Satan to gain authority from him over worldly kingdoms. Nor did he derive his power to govern from the consent of the governed, that is to say, from the people.

The sole hope for relief is in the divine government. Let the people stop calling upon their false gods and idols for relief. Since our God Jehovah the Almighty now rules as king, it is entirely out of order to worship other gods and creature-made idols. He will not tolerate any false worship in the new world. So why not praise and serve him as King without delay?

True Christians will devote what they have of this world’s goods, whether little or much, to bringing this message to the poor and comforting those who mourn. We remember that a person’s life is not due to the things that he possesses, but his eternal existence depends on the treasure he stores up in heaven. We consistently add to our heavenly treasure by preaching the good news of the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Each publisher of the Kingdom message is directly responsible to the Great Judge for the work he does or does not do in and with the congregation.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use hare their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong. For this reason, now that we have left the elementary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity.—Heb. 5:14;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Christian proves he has wisdom and understanding by obeying the commands to preach. (Ps. 111:10) By using the divine education in field service, by repeating Bible truths at the doors of the peo-day, but there are other methods Satan uses to turn ns from our good work. Some of us learn the truth after we have acquired families. These families do not always believe the Scriptures as we do. Sometimes they put every hindrance in our way in an effort to make us fail to stick to our worship. Even when they oppose our good works we must see that they have life’s necessities if we are family providers. In the end they may accept the truth and we shall gain our families for the Lord God by setting a faithful example of belief and good works. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his brethren.

That will eliminate any spirit of competition from the congregation and the conse-?uent feeling of dejection, in-eriority or discouragement prone to occur to those able to perform less service than others.

Continued study refills the imperfect mind that lets the truth waters escape as if from a leaky vessel. Diligent use of his mental faculties in study exercises and strengthens them till they can digest not only the milk but the solid food of God’s Word, and the strength gained by it equips him to withstand persecution and other satanic snares that abound in this world. He advances to perfection of maturity, bearing more and more good fruit. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you too young to serve? Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians A.D. 50 and in that epistle referred to Timothy as a “minister of God”. He must have been a lad in his teens, for more than ten years later he was still young, and Paul advised, “Let no man ever look down on your youth.” (1 Tim. 4:12, J'W) At the age of twelve years Jesus preached and amazed hearers with his</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The clergy of Christendom and millions of their religious followers claim to be Christians. They are not living up to the name. By claiming to be Christians they assume the obligation to witness to Jehovah’s name through Jesus Christ. They take the name Christian, but do they measure up to it? No I They decline to be witnesses of Jehovab. False impersonation is a fraud. To im-wisdom. And, do you know, Samuel ministered to Jehovah at the tabernacle and prophesied right after he was weaned! Are you younger than that? Some may plead old age as a reason to retire. Aaron was ordained a priest when 83 years old. Moses was 80 when be was launched into service as a mediator between Jehovah and Israel, in which capacity he served till his death, at the age of 120. The apostle John was around one hundred years of age when he wrote his contributions that completed the Bible canon.

Material possessions arc used to Jebovah’s honor. Words once used in improper religious ways are now offered as sacrifices of praise to God. as sacrificial bullocks devoted wholly to Jehovah by burnt offering. (Hos. 14:2; Heb. 13:15) Just as it was Gideon’s sacrifice to God that consumed Baal’s goods, so it is the Christian sacrifice of praise that disposes of false religion’s doctrines. The words of praise that Christians catch up from the Bible and use in their preaching overturn the false teachings of today’s organized religions of Christendom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">personate certain officials of a government or assume to represent a government of this world without being authorized to do so is a crime. A person, not a member, but wearing the uniform of the armed forces of a nation may be prosecuted and imprisoned. The law of the land makes it a felony, punishable by heavy fine and long prison term. Christendom’s clergy have falsely assumed the name Christian. Therefore they arc guilty of impersonating the first witness of Jehovah, the Lord Christ Jesus, in violation of God’s law. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There is this to remember concerning organizations generally. When young and growing, fighting their way up, zeal is strong and evangelistic; but when they have won their place and become strong and wealthy and respected they often lose their virile strength and become lax, fat, sluggish, and point with pride to their size, and put their directives above God’s commands.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12:28, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Often an examination of oneself is beneficial to see if the commandments of Jehovah and Christ are being obeyed. Are we really sharing in the ministry committed to the chosen ones? Is our heart really behind our service effort? Are we truly devoting all? If this is true in our case, then we .nay depend upon it that we shall not be fearful. If, of minds and hearts are set on serving God is to your eternal welfare. As the final end draws nearer wickedness increases and time spent in touch with the world becomes increasingly hazardous. Some will neglect meetings, according to Paul, and they will advance one argument or another for doing so, but that is not the profitable course to follow. By setting and meeting the goal never to miss any of the meetings that the Lord provides for his people, the Christian is protected against becoming involved in the affairs of this world. He does not have time for it! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">has happened to the organizations of the big, prosperous orthodox systems of Christendom. The organization is served and worshiped instead of the one it claims to represent, namely, Jehovah God. But this snare will never catch Jehovah’s cleansed people today. The growing visible organization does not fill them with the pride that precedes falls, but serves to remind them that Jehovah is directing and blessing the work, that it is his seasonal time for gathering in the fruits of gospel-preaching.— Prov. 16:18. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">course, a pretense is being carried out, if we are just going along with the crowd and not making sure of our steps and coming to a personal decision, then we may expect to be fearful. To be fearless must mean entering into the truth, the commands, the service, the experiences with all we have, completely devoted to Jehovah’s holy will. If there was a real fear of the Almighty then no creature of sound mind would ever dare displease him. For our own well-being it is imperative that we learn </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fear him.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have to exercise endurance in order to produce Kingdom fruit in praise to God, just as a farmer has to exercise patience and show good endurance when he cultivates the soil and growing crop. As he works, he must wait upon God to make things grow. (Mark 4 : 26-29) A person must trust in God to make him grow into he had foretold during previous millenniums. In due time his Son left the heavenly courts and was born as a man and the prophecies began fulfilling concerning him. Then the long-hidden secret was uncovered to those who believed and received God’s spirit. By means of his Son God did away with what was old that he might introduce what was new. (Heb. 10:5-10) The replacement of the first set of sacrifices with the second kind of sacrifice which really sanctifies means a new high priest of God. Jesus. It means a new relationship of worshipers with God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">lyzed with fear so that our hands droop helplessly in inaction. “Droop not your hands,” is the divine command in this day to Jehovah’s anointed remnant and their companions of good will. The enemy may forcibly take us into his power and hold us bound or restricted physically, but if we fearlessly continue to speak the pure language to all with whom we come in touch under even the most unfavorable conditions, then God's word or message of the Kingdom will not be bound. He is mighty to come to our rescue and deliver us in his own time and manner.

By displaying endurance he proves his trust in God. In turn, God increases the seed yield of the enduring one that this seed may be scattered about By Kingdom preaching.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah is enthroned on the cherubim who uphold his sovereignty, but not the one who was the “anointed cherub that covereth” in Eden.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This counsel from a father to a son is primarily from Jehovah to his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and also embraces the members of the body of Christ. But in principle it applies to every human creature who will ever attain to life in or under Jehovah’s kingdom. This exhortation from, the two greatest counselors in the universe, Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ, among the cherubim to be king of the new world is an event powerfully affecting our earth. No wonder it has been shaking, figuratively speaking, since 1914! Its nations God has put on judgment to make them show their attitude toward his King and his kingdom for which Christendom has hypocritically professed to pray. Now is no time for truly Godfearing people to follow the worldly political and religious leaders in ignoring and defying Jehovah’s rule as king. It is a time for the people to tremble. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to represent and speak for him is that they tell the truth about God and impart the real knowledge of him to the people. The whole teaching of the Bible from cover to cover is that the people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge of God the Creator and Savior. To supply the need God offers the people the knowledge in his inspired Book. Therefore let us who want to be his faithful witnesses bear this in mind and not be turned aside to something else. Let us hold strictly to dispensing God’s pure Word to his honor and to the saving of the people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">9/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to give attention to God’s Word, to get understanding of that Word, that we might fully appreciate our relationship to our God and his organization, is therefore something to be greatly appreciated and taken very seriously. (Prov. 1:8) We on our part must do something. We must get understanding of Jehovah’s purposes and learn how they apply to us individually and collectively. If we refuse or neglect to get this understanding we endanger our future existence in any part of God’s realm. Therefore, under-standingly, keep his Word in mind and obey his commandments.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Older men” does not refer to “elected elders” made so by the popular vote of some Congregation.

We will fulfill our obligation to warn all nations of the coming “act of God” rather those mature in spiritual . growth and development. It is such mature ones that are chosen for the more responsible duties as servants among God’s sheep. So whether you are appointed to care for the Kingdom interests as a company servant in a congregation or as assistant servant assigned to look after other organizational details, you do well to take special heed to Peter’s exhortation, for he speaks as an older man like you, a fully matured servant of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On the atonement day in the fiftieth year the jubilee trumpet was sounded throughout the land of Israel. Sounding that trumpet meant liberty for the people: “proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.” (Vs. 10) Today the jubilee trumpet is sounding throughout the earth. This means liberty for the prisoners held in ignorance and superstition in the Devil’s organization and its religions prison-houses. By Jehovah’s grace, a great crowd of these are finding their way to the free organization of Jehovah, where they can find liberty and peace. No longer do they look to men as the “superior authorities” whom they must serve and obey. (Rom. 13:1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the “Superior Authorities” that all consecrated believers now look to, and in them they find rest and security.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Living up to the name requires preaching. Jehovah’s witnesses distribute magazines containing his Word on the streets and, incidental to preaching to people in their homes, offer them Bibles and explanatory literature. Literature is an additional channel of the flowing stream of education that leads to life. Revisits are required of the ministers to maintain a constant flow of the truth. This continual helpfulness, exercised in a wise and tactful way, produces good results, proving that Jehovah’s witnesses are living up to the name. Doing so with perseverance requires them to stand on the street corners with the magazines regardless of the stony faces, cold looks and rebukes of passers-by, or bad weather. It means they will continue their witnessing regardless of the lack of interest shown. It means that territory will be combed over regularly even though door after door ■nay be slammed in the face. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is well to keep constantly in mind that the pattern which our individual lives follow, the way we use our time, is largely determined by habits we have formed, whether good or bad. Usually the course that seems most difficult, when carefully examined, proves to be the best. It is a broad way that Satan constructs to lead his followers to death. The traveler on life’s way can ill afford to waste his time on excursions away from the narrow, more difficult road. He may find some day that he has traveled too far; habits may have such a firm grip upon him that the remaining time will prove too short to extricate himself and return to the path of life. Do not allow yourself to be enticed into being a lover of pleasures more than a lover of God as do those from whom Christians are advised to turn away.

(1 Tim. 5:8) If others in the family become so violent as to take the Christian believer’s life, then Christ will restore life in the Kingdom time. But if one backs up into inactivity in order to save his earthly life, he would in the end displease the Life-giver and lose everlasting life.

It is just as hard today for many people to give up even little things and work in the interests of the poor and comfort those who mourn, with the Kingdom message. They are busy trying to hang on to and gain more earthly possessions. This is selfishness. It is greediness. It is covetousness. “For the love of money is the root of all evil.” (1 Tim. 6: 10) The way of a man who lays up money for himself is not rich toward God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (Matt. 10:8; Acts 20:35, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> By his study of God’s Word and by instruction gained at the ministry school of Jehovah’s witnesses and at service meeting, and by observing the good examples of zealous witnesses, his mental outlook has changed over from old-world to new-world thinking.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said these words, not to pagan Romans and Greeks, but to religious Jews, members of a nation consecrated to Jehovah God, chosen by him and brought into a covenant with him.

Pagan Romans paid worship to Caesar and religious honors to military standards and ensigns. By the first two of the Ten Commandments consecrated Jews like Jesus were forbidden to do this. So when Jesus said to those under theocratic law that they must pay back God’s things to God, he meant Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah will not be served through any political government nor through any agency of idol-images. It is by and through the Kingdom that he will perfect praise to himself, in heaven and earth. That is why the Kingdom is the predominant theme of the Bible. Now it stands in revealed heavenly glory, and it will soon command unlimited jurisdiction of this earth. So the day is truly here when men must decide whether to worship and praise other creatures and vent them from snatching God’s Word from those not yet understanding it. Yes, we must even try to beat those “birds” to it. How ? By calling without delay upon those who express interest after hearing the message or by making return visits upon those in whose homes we place the literature. So doing, we can anticipate the action of the greedy “birds” and can help receivers of the Word to understand it and develop an appetite for more of it. We can make our regular visits back progressively helpful by instituting a Bible study there, using Bible helps. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to confirm it, in the light of Isaiah 28: 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> So, this is a case where the strange thing or foolish thing is the profitable thing. So profitable that it leads to life. What greater profit can there be than that? What, then, if the wise men of this world do scoff and ridicule? That is no cause to fear them and hold them in awe to the point of failing to preach and thus fall short of using time to greatest profit “A foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men.”—■ 1 Cor. 1: 25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW.

Such names detract from the real person glorified by them, who is Jehovah God, the Creator of all things. He dictated the Bible itself, which is his Word.

The knowledge of God minus his Son Jesus is only partial. Life by the law of Moses is impossible. Likewise the knowledge of Jesus Christ minus Jehovah God is only partial, as in Christendom’s case today. To know Jehovah God and to know Jesus Christ are inseparable for salvation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have been used in its preparation. The King will rule in righteousness, enforcing God’s law and breaking down every power opposing truth and justice. This kingdom Christ Jesus receives from his Father. No man or earthly powers could possibly give it to him, for it is not theirs. Satan, the god of this evil world, never had the possession of the earth with its many created things. These were not his to give to anyone. Adam did not come into this glorious dominion. So the everlasting Kingdom belongs to Christ Jesus.—Heb. 2: 5-9. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">bor as you do yourself, especially as far as sharing with him God’s Kingdom news. Remember that your closest neighbors on earth are your own brothers and sisters within the fold of the Right Shepherd Jesus Christ. He gave his disciples a new commandment to love one another as he had loved them. By this true affection all men of understanding would know they were his disciples. By doing these things they would be happy, because they would be wise, and their wisdom would be justified by the results that flowed from it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5:17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have come to the New Jerusalem, God’s capital of the universe. We have a new temple, of which Jesus Christ is chief cornerstone and all his spiritual followers arc living stones, built upon him as the foundation. We have a new high priest, a new sacrifice of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">superior kind which actually cleanses awaj- sins by its blood, a new law inscribed on our hearts, a new mediator between God and men, a new covenant. Anything more? Yes, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge, new works of vah’s universal organization, which he created and of which he is the faithful Husband. (Isa. 54: 5) By her he brings forth his beloved children for his purpose. By her he gives us law and instruction, provides for us, guides us and looks out for our welfare with a view to our everlasting life. Besides her sons for kingship with Christ, she is interested also in the many “other sheep” who will eventually become her earthly children in God’s image and likeness. Her heart is big enough to hold love for them all and to gather them to her warm, loving bosom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he saves only when no strange god is among his people. (Isa. 43: 12) Before Jehovah directed steps against the invading hordes of Midianites in Gideon’s day, Baal was cast down and the sincere Israelites were cleansed of its taints. Antitypi-cally, before Jehovah sent his witnesses against the Devil's systems in bold attack after 1918 he caused them to undergo a spiritual cleansing under the oversight of the Greater Gideon Christ Jesus at the temple. It was that they might “offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God in fulfillment of past prophecies and types, a new ministry, and a new relationship with God as his new nation of spiritual Israel and as his sons whose spirit cries out to him, “Abba, Father!” True Christians, living up to their privileges, have long enjoyed these things over the centuries. Today a faithful remnant of Christ’s joint heirs are enjoying them. All these new things operating together as new systems of things since Pentecost are preliminary to God’s own new world. They are an absolute guarantee of the full coming of the new-world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Praise Jah, you people!” is what his witnesses cry all over the earth. They know the exclusive name of the Most High and they point out his identity to all who do not know him. They show all the glory, fame and good promises that attach to his holy name.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Men of this world hold the power to kill millions, by the grace of the Devil. They have their bacteria bombs and A-bombs and look to potent H-bombs. We of the coming new world hold in our hand the power to show the path of life to millions, by the grace of God. We have and understand his Word, which overflows with waters of life. The old liverer, their Creator, their hope of everlasting life in the new world is. They have no misleading praises for the manmade political systems and rulerships of this world, no, nor for any part of modern Babylon. Their praise is of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ. They have no heart for world politics. They do not sully themselves by meddling in human politics. In this respect they hold to the true definition of clean worship of God, at James 1:27. As ambassadors for God’s kingdom they offer praise of the divine Government they represent. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">world is mobilized to produce death by feeding raw materials into factory assembly lines to turn out shells, bombs and poisonous gases. New world servants are mobilized to produce the life-giving message, by maintaining printing plants that heap up stocks of Bibles and Bible helps. The world is organized to distribute its killers, by recruiting armies to man tanks, ships and planes that deliver death to the battlefields. We new world workers are organized in companies to distribute the message of life from door to door and on the streets world-wide. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Rom. 13: 3, 4, NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is for our good that we subject ourselves to the “superior authorities” and to God’s arrangement of them. The greatest good deed that a person can perform is to serve God according to his commandments and to act as a minister of his Word, bearing witness to his name, purpose and universal sovereignty. But in lands behind the “iron curtain” and in so-called democratic lands where fascistic dictators and totalitarian hierarchies hold control, Jehovah’s witnesses are forbidden to perform such a good deed. In fact, in all lands they are penalized in various ways for serving the living, true God in harmony with his Word. They are hated by all nations and peoples. Multitudes are frightened off from taking their stand openly for Jehovah and his kingdom. So such political rulers are not God’s ministers to us for good. Let them admit it.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses are ministers of God, ordained to preach the Word. They love to serve his King of the new world now. Their hope and faith is in the kingdom of God, for through it the blessings of eternal life will be gained. So they continue to work and pray : “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” While being good citizens of the nation in which they live, paying their taxes,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5:20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is no small responsibility to be a spokesman or ambassador for the Government of Almighty God. Your life and the lives of others depend upon how well you preach, how convincing your argument, how steadfast your efforts. Does it not seem, then, that we in whose hands rests such a responsibility can profitably spend some of our time in improving our abilities as ministers of God through study?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; and he will show them his cove</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nant.—Ps. 25:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Creatures should stand in awe before Jehovah and bow down before his great and terrible name, for no one should willfully cause his displeasure. Disobedience is punishable by death. Has he not the right and power to destroy? While fearing to incur his anger for rebellion, stubbornness, idolatry and all forms of disobedience, yet God’s children must love him. Perfect love will cast out complying with the laws of the land as long as these laws are in full accord with God's laws, still they move ahead, expanding their activity among the people, following out the principal command of Jehovah, “Preach the word.” From one end of the earth to the other these persons of good will have organized themselves until now there are 13.238 companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. As such they assemble together regularly for study of God’s Word in order to prepare themselves to be better ministers of the Lord God. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Study is indeed, a profitable thing. No Christian should allow himself to acquire the mistaken belief he can gain the approval of God without studying, or that he is too busy to spend time profitably for study. Without </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">continued</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> study truths once highly treasured grow dim and fade away. We, being leaky vessels, might become dry unless the waters of truth are replenished. Such a dried-out source can scarcely be expected to quench the thirst of a person seeking after the truth if haply he inignt find it. The time of both the hearer and the preacher would be wasted. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">all slavish fear and give the creature a proper appreciation of his relationship to his Creator. No one who really has an awe, dread, reverence, yes, fear of Jehovah, has fear of man or world conditions. Those loyal and faithful to the Most High God know from scriptures and experience that fear and love of him go hand in hand and are not, in His case, in opposition. They fear to do anything con-tiary to his will, for he can destroy; yet they love him with all they have. If we maintain fear of God, we shall be kept fearless of men; and now this is most important. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s language is as pure as truth. It is the only pure language. Now is the time to be speaking it.

It does away with religious error and false worship and unites all persons who speak the language in a pure worship of the living and true God. In an era</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">You who are appointed servants, follow the Chief Shepherd’s pattern in conduct. Imitate his apostles! Display before your brethren proper examples both in word and in deed! Be faithful, steady, regular, calm, earnest, humble, thoughtful, meek, peaceable, trustworthy, dependable, sincere. Above all, show love. Lovingly and with great mercy, tenderness and longsuffering seek out the Lord's “other sheep” that are lost, and when she looks well to that, using all her organizational means and powers for their welfare. She builds up the stature and strength of her sons and daughters by feeding them with food. All those who serve her, whether they be directly her children or not, she feeds and strengthens for service. Besides feeding, she also sees to the clothing of her children. She works up materials with which to clothe them, that they may be presentable with a godly, Christian identification of which they need never be ashamed, the identity as witnesses of her Husband. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">when the 2,796 listed languages and dialects of the world act as a great barrier to people’s uuderstandiug of one another and when hundreds of religious sects confuse and prejudice mankind on the vital matter of worship, Jehovah God is turning to the many peoples of today a “pure language”. But why learn that language? Because our rescue from destruction depends on our pure worship and service of the Most High God. It is the prime requirement of our salvation. In the very nick of time God mercifully turns the language to us. Iv </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">you find them, feed them. Food is the important thing. As the wise man says: “Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me.” (Prov. 30: 8, AS) This necessary food provided by the good and righteous Shepherd is God’s revealed Word, which if any eat they are promised eternal life. (John 6:68) Feed not only the spiritually skinny “sheep” you find outside in the field, but also, you servants, feed and take care of the flock of which you are a part.—Acts 20 : 28. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W If/15</span></p>

We are advised not to put all our energies into worldly enterprises, as these things are doomed to destruction at the near battle of Armageddon, and if we give all our time to such things it will be lost. It will be time lost because such things are the prestige and adoration they once enjoyed. They lose the flattering titles that allowed them to glitter and shine. Any treasures of service they might have enjoyed are gone, because they used their offices to show off themselves. These attentiongrabbing things are not transferred to truth-telling witnesses, but are lumped together and given over for Jehovah’s honor. As men of good will learn the truth they strip the worldly honored ones of improper titles and adornments and give all praise to Jehovah and render to God and Christ their dues. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sharp. All sixty-six books of the Bible, inspired by the one Teacher Jehovah God and collected under the guidance of his spirit, contain pointed truths that must be driven deep into one’s mind. Like nails sledged into a board, they will not pull out but can be held onto with confidence, serving as a sure anchor to keep us from being slapped and tossed and battered about by the blowing winds of worldly propaganda.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall wiite him a copy of this law in a book . . . and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn.—Deut. 17:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus acquired understanding from study of God’s Word. He was not born with it as a human babe ; he had to study the Word of Jehovah. If study was necessary for the King to obtain understanding and learn to fear Jehovah, how much more is it necessary for us share with him in vindicating God. Three and a half years later, at the conversion of the first uncircumcised Gentiles at the home of Cornelius, the outpouring of the holy spirit that was witnessed at Pentecost when the heavenly calling was opened to the Jews was extended to the Gentiles. We remember that the wave-offering loaves were two in number and were made of the first-fruits of the wheat harvest and were baked with yeast. This showed that the called ones were to be from Jews and Gentiles and were not righteous in themselves but required the righteousness of Christ to make them acceptable. 17 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">stained by the world. Not only must they keep entirely free from political, commercial and religious elements of the old world, but they must also abstain from the nefarious living habits of the world. They must avoid the standards of personal conduct prevalent in the world in respect to morals and honesty it they are to keep themselves without spot from the world. They keep themselves clean morally and physically. This they do. They know God requires all who bear the message as his vessels to be clean. —Isa. 52:11. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">subjects to study His law and diligently apply ourselves to an understanding of his purposes! This we must do if we are to acquire that confidence and reliance that will enable us to step out on the promises of Jehovah with peace and implicit assurance that he will fulfill every oue of them. This is understanding: it means ‘eating the book’. We must diligently apply ourselves to a thorough study, so that this knowledge provided by God becomes part of us and makes us ready and equipped always to give an answer for our hope. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Today the faithful announcers of God’s kingdom by Christ face political movements and organizations on a hemispheric 01 global scale. To date the United Nations has failed to cement the old world. It is split into two blocs, with the Big Three championing the Western bloc and Communist Russia dictating for the Eastern bloc.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God wants his people to understand his written Word, the Bible. By understanding we gain the full assurance concerning what we believe. It is only when we understand that we can declare our beliefs to other people and can do so with strong conviction that we have the truth which is worthy of acceptance</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">That in the coming systems of things there might be demonstrated the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness toward us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Eph. 2:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The systems of things under which we have lived according to the new covenant have been grand, but those which will obtain in the new world will be oh so much grander for all its society. Why should it not be different, yes, better? For it will have new heavens and a new earth. The destruction of this old world with its Devil-controlled heavens and earth world situation stand Jehovah’s witnesses, pointing neither east nor west, but heavenward, heralding his kingdom by Christ as the divinely authorized government, the only government with ability to introduce a righteous, peaceful, healthful new world. For this neutral position toward the deadly conflicts of this old world and for their Christian devotion and allegiance to God’s new world government by his Son Jehovah’s witnesses are hated by all nations and suffer persecution at the hands of the religious friends of the world. Yet our cause is bound to increase and win. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by all. There is not much good in hearing something and yet not understanding it, for then it does not mean anything to us. We can never do right without understanding what God’s will is. Rather, we are sure to act foolish in his sight, and this would not win his approval. But when we understand his will as contained in his written instructions, we can do it. As we do so it builds up a full assurance of hope in us, and we can firmly hold onto that hope to the en&lt;L So let us not underrate the riches of the full assurance of understanding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">will therefore be no calamity. We look eagerly for it, doing as 2 Peter 3:12,13 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">says: “Awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, . . . But there are new heavens and a new earth that we.are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwelt” The kingdom of Jesus Christ, together with his 144,000 faithful followers, will spread out its power over all this globe and win form the “new heavens”. The “new earth” will be human society organized under a new, righteous system. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.—Ps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Since 1914 it is eminently improper for any nation or person to do what seems right to just the human mind, as in the days when there was no visible human king in the land of Israel but “every man did that which was right in his own eyes”. (Judg. 21: 25) The mind unguided by God’s Word and spirit is certain to be influenced by the world and its god Satan the Devil and hence to go wrong. Proverbs 14:12 ter how far off they have been dispersed over the earth, the pure language of the Kingdom message has sounded out like a trumpet blast at a king’s coronation and reached their ears and turned these dispersed ones to the Kingdom. So from all places they have assembled to it as one people by uniting their hearts to the Kingdom. They have come as &quot;suppliants”, supplicating the favor of Jehovah and his reigning King, and their supplications have risen like an incense that is sweet-smelling to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tory in which just to place books. True, the printed page can take the place of the oral sermon. But Paul and Barnabas stayed a whole year in Antioch to teach the people. Not because Paul and Barnabas did not have printed or hand-copied literature to put out on a contribution for their support. No; but because the verbal message sown on the heart or mind can be snatched away by Satan’s birds just as easily as, if not more quickly than, a printed message. Hence the need to stay in the territory to forestall the coming and activity of the “birds”. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">says: “There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” The times of ignorance God once overlooked. But now ignorance cannot be pleaded as an excuse for wrong action according to the human mind, particularly so now that he has raised up his witnesses in all the earth and sends them out with the message of his established kingdom. (Acts 17: 30) This is the time of judgment of the nations. This world will never return to the conditions that existed before 1914. For God’s kingdom is here, and is here to stay I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God gave us the one original Bible. The Bible Is the textbook which teaches this language of the righteous new world.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Christendom is lining herself up with the forces of Gog of Magog for the final assault upon the visible organization of Jehovah’s people. Shortly, at a thieflike hour, the Supreme Warrior for truth and righteousness will make himself known to all his oppose™ in a language they will understand, the language of cosmic forces that will speak destruction to them. However, that pure message of God’s written Word, which he as its Author alone can make clear by his spirit. That message reveals who he is, what his name is, what his unchangeable purposes are concerning his friends and his enemies, now and in the new world. It is the message of the new world government. his kingdom in the hands of his anointed King, Jesus Christ. People who declare Jehovah’s purpose according to the revealed Scriptures and who announce his kingdom are speaking that pure language, declaring his name, serving him unitedly. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tribe of Levi, when Jesus ascended to heaven to offer the value of his hnman sacrifice to God. Not only that, but the national system whereby the Jews had a human king reigning on the “throne of Jehovah” at Jerusalem came to a decisive end. They rejected Jesus the Son of David as their King and after he rose from the dead he refused to restore the earthly kingdom to natural Israel. Besides that, there had been a system of prophetic types and shadows dramatizing wonderful realities which were to come, and after Jesus ascended to heaven, this system ended. Now the time had come for fulfillment of these.

We want to know them in a way that means everlasting life, not destruction. We do not await destruction at the battle of Armageddon, but confidently expect to survive through that fiery time into the new world. Yet, to realize such preservation at this world’s end, just as Noah and his ark companions enjoyed preservation at the watery end of the former world, we must live according to knowledge. We must increase in knowledge to make us strong to endure. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Totalitarian hordes overran Europe. Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested in large numbers, and overnight east into prisons or concentration camps. The Society’s work was interfered with and some branch offices occupied by the gunmen. But the faithful went on with the work. How many times it can be recalled that a seemingly impossible situation arose, yes, often involving Jehovah’s service and the interests and well-being of the brethren; yet a way out was force. Through the Word of God man learns of him. His Word discloses his purpose. The divine purpose is that all mankind shall know about him, learn of his attributes and understand his law and purposes. For that reason he purposed to raise up a people for his name, in order that his light for the mind of man might shine in the earth. Since his holy name implies the giving of light, then, if his people in the earth reflect his light, they must live up to the name of Jehovah, the God of purpose toward man on the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">their food has not been theocratically tested. There are those who try to serve up meals for Jehovah’s people on their own tables independent of Jehovah’s, but it is of no use, for once they have left Jehovah’s household and set up housekeeping their food gets stale, and so do they. Besides, consider the fateful results to those who treat Jehovah’s table with contempt. (Malachi 1, 2) The safest way is to be content with the food of the Master’s providing and as served out by his “faithful and discreet slave”. Masticate the food well, and you will rejoice and be strong. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">provided! And at knowing it was no one but Jehovah who had so acted gratitude would fill the heart; our love for him grew deeper and stronger and true fear of Jehovah brought forward its own rich reward. So today all the children of the Most High rejoice in the faithful, fearless action of those who were honored and privileged to have assigned to them such opportunities of service, which have all been for advancing and expanding Jehovah’s service. The ministry was performed. They were used and others have benefited. Fearlessness brings reward from Jehovah. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Certainly there is nothing to be fearful about in going forward in preaching God’s Word. Not with such a promise. There will be hardships, difficulties and problems to overcome ; maybe some will be killed. Jesus told us to expect that kind of treatment. But life! This is the gift to those who love Jehovah. Even though persons do see death now, there is a reward for those who love righteousness and who have been storing up</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i: 13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul’s words here hold instruction for the time-conscious servant of God. “Continue applying yourself,” he says. How easy it is, while reading, to allow the mind to wander to things not apropos, so that, even while the eye is scanning the lines and pages, time is not being profitably spent!

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Acts 20:28, NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark283"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Supreme Shepherd employs methods superior and altogether different from those used by others, in handling, tending and looking after the needs of his flock. Instead of bringing in hirelings, such as popes, cardinals, archbishops and bishops, giving them lofty and high-sounding titles and setting them up to rule over the flock, God Almighty raises treasures in heaven. Jesus said: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life, and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.” (11:25,26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The time is coming, in the new world, when there will be no more death. (Rev. 21:4) Of course, most of the people of the world today do not believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ nor in the merit of his sacrifice. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses as God’s ministers must preach the good news of his Word to them, that they may have the opportunity of believing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

While preaching, let thoughts of accomplishing the most good in the available time fill the mind. And similarly with each task that falls in the hand of the Christian to do. ‘Do with your might what your hands find to do,’ admonishes Eccl. 9:10. To do mighty works one cannot be content with ‘beating the air’. (1 Cor. 9:26) Knowledge is essential to profitable preaching. This needs study. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">up from among his own flock certain ones whom he appoints as servants or “slaves” to look after and care for the needs of their brethren as he directs. Faithful to their appointments as slaves, these sheep-tenders never try to turn the flock to one side or out of the right way or exploit the flock for their own profit, but rather they guide and direct Jehovah’s sheep in his appointed way. It is therefore Jehovah God that takes full responsibility and receives full credit and praise for the way of prosperity in which his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">pe</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ople now find themselves. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With understanding we shall be equipped to meet every issue with positive Scriptural answers, even as Jesus did when he was tempted by the adversary. This is understanding; it means ‘eating the words of God which we find’. It means much more than simply taking the instruments he supplies for our edification, such as the Bible, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the books and booklets and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and looking them over superficially or just study</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The heart of the righteous studieth to answer.—Prov. 15:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The mouth cannot speak good things of praise to God unless the heart is ready to snpply the message from its abundance. Study, then! That is what you must do so as to serve God in the right way; and as you learn you must put your knowledge to work by telling others. This will strengthen your faith, “the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (Heb. 11:1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday, July 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you.—1 Tim. 4:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Why is it necessary to give such pointed advice? Because there is real struggle in keeping going in God’s work. Were it true that no one opposed our work, then, of course, it would be much easier. However, we must be aware that the Devil is our adversary and is very angry now, since he has been cast out of heaven. He is busily trying to turn all creatures away from God and into ing them in order to be able to answer a question on meeting night. No, we must study these theocratic publications until we understand their contents thoroughly. If necessary, wrestle with the subject, pray to God for help. Do not quit! Jacob had to wrestle all night with Jehovah’s angel in order to get a blessing. Jehovah rewarded his diligence and determination. He will likewise reward ours. He tells us, if we lack wisdom, to ask him for it, and he will bestow it upon us abundantly without adding any sorrow to it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus you will be better able to commend to others the good works of God. Through personal study you will gain an insight of God’s omnipotence; you will hear of his wondrous acts in times past in behalf of men of good will and you will see what he promises for our day and for the new world now at hand. Paul says “faith follows the report. In turn, the report is through the word about Christ”. (Rom. 10: 17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> So you must study the Word of God<sub>;</sub> which requires merely the ability to hear and read the report in your own native tongue. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">destruction with him at the coming conflict. He wants to make each one slack the hand, slow down, and finally stop completely from God’s beneficial work. He is still trying to fight God by overcoming Jehovah’s servants, for he well knows that then they will lose out on God’s precious promises and Kingdom blessings. Jesus advised: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.” (Luke 9:62, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Looking at the things behind means not keeping the Kingdom interests first. It means not staying by these things. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow.—Judg. 8:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The anointed remnant have been pressing on in the battle of truth against lies for many years now. Though aging and nearing exhaustion, they do not give in to weariness of flesh but keep up chasing the enemy, “faint, yet pursuing them.” Frequently they could use such assistance as that</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Since God’s kingdom is now the rightful Challenger, the Kingdom issue must henceforth be pressed to a decisive finish.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We are not peddlers of the word of God.—2 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2:17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Like Paul, Jehovah’s witnesses today can say this because they do not stop with the placement of literature in the homes of the people. Book peddlers have completed their work with the distribution of their wares, but not so the minister placing Bible helps. In his wielding of the “sword of the spirit” he does not make one thrust in the form of a book placement and then sheathe the truth-sword, but follows through by making a symbolized by bread or a cup of cold water. Those who refuse to assist Christ’s brethren are adversely judged by him as King and he says to them: “I became hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat, and I got thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink. . . . depart into everlasting cutting-off.” (Matt, 25: 42, 46; 10: 42, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Such goatish ones think this world organization under Satan is all right and will continue on as the controlling power, and they cast their lot with it. Such ones were prefigured by the men of Succoth and also of Penuel, and will suffer a like fate. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon. In this interim of years between Satan’s ousting from heaven and the battle of Armageddon, there has been no stabilizing of conditions by man or United Nations nor any restoring of “normalcy”, and there will be none. But in this interim now soon to end God is mercifully exercising patience in behalf of saving people of good will. So the wise thing to do is to take advantage of his patience and. mercy and heed his Kingdom message, turn to him and his King as the only hope and then laud and magnify his worthy name.—2 Pet. 3: 15. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">stab for a home Bible study. He is zealous to revisit those willing to hear him again on these vital subjects. And on such revisits he conducts Bible studies free of charge. Jesus said: “Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into his house and take the evening meal with him, and he with me.” (Rev. 3:20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jesus taught in homes and revisited homes when there was special interest. He continues to do so till this days not in person, but representatively by his followers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here Jesus pointed to the beginning of the fulfillment of this part of the feast of tabernacles. The river of water of life seen later by John in the Revelation proceeded out of the throne of God and of the Lamb Christ Jesus. At the end of the Gentile times, A.D. 1914, Jesus was placed on the throne as King of the new world. (Rev. 22 :1; 12: 5) Af</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Greatly outnumbered by worldly enemies, Jehovah’s anointed witnesses must rely upon God’s help. Of themselves they can do nothing. So they continually test their position, examine themselves, search the Scriptures to see that their preaching remains in harmony therewith, look for evidences</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What if one who receives a servant’s assignment feels he is incapable of handling the duties? What should he do? Accept the appointment as from Jehovah, and pray for his spirit and power to be upon you to help you handle the job faithfully and efficiently. Remember, Jehovah’s wrath was kindled against Moses when he protested he was unfit for his assignment. Appointed by God as a special servant and witter this the river of water of life would flow to quench the thirst of all people of good will. During the past the waters, representing truth, had been fouled by the false shepherds, the unfaithful clergy. (Ezek. 34 :18,19) The river of crystal-pure water proceeding from the throne is, no doubt, part of what Jesus referred to when he said at the feast of tabernacles : “He that puts faith in me, just as the Scripture has said, ‘Out from his inmost part streams of living water will flow.’ ” (John 7: 38, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> For the Christian remnant today are serving others this water. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah's direction and blessing, and stay alert to profit by any divine rebuke or correction. As they preach they invite others to assemble with them. Many refuse. Others at these meetings discern the fight involved, see the enemy host arrayed against the witnesses, discover the persecution that comes, and withdraw from the company of the fearless ones. Not having the perfect love for God that casts out all fear, they are snared by fear of man and fright binds their mind in bondage. They return to captivity and are disapproved. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ness to go before wicked Pharaoh of Egypt, Moses in substance replied: ‘Who?

When appointed as the Lord’s servant and prophet, Jeremiah threw up his hands and cried: ‘O Jehovah, I am but a child; I can’t speak.’ (Jer. 1: 6, 7) In both of these cases, protesting that they were unqualified for the assignment was the same as telling Jehovah he had made a mistake in choosing them. So volunteer; be willing. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lf/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Toward hundreds of thousands this has already occurred. Who knows how many other hundreds of thousands are yet to have this occur with them before the battle of Armageddon?

But when the sun rose they were scorched, and because of not having root they withered.—Matt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IS: 5, 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To prove worthy of everlasting life, especially Bfe with Christ in the heavenly kingdom, we must show decision for the right and then stick to it with endurance down to the end. Quitters will never gain eternal life; and that fact holds true also for those pertreachery on your part. Let your lives as well as your purged Ups speak the pure language. The name of the wicked enemies who belong to this world will rot, but the name and praise of Jehovah’s witnesses will live forever on the luminous pages of eternity to God's vindication. To the final work, then! “Let us not give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.” (GaL 6: 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Till we reap the full share in the vindication of his name at his victory on Armageddon’s battlefield, “droop not your hands” but raise them always in praise to him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">proof that the new world is on the way. God is not now preparing us for nothing. No; but he has a new world in store for us. Knowing what is right at hand, God is now getting ready a New World society. That is why we are living differently, as people who are not of the society of this old world. He is not only preparing his remnant of spiritual Israelites for membership in the heavenly kingdom of the new heavens. He is also preparing our good-will companions, the great crowd of “other sheep”, for the visible society of the new earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sons of good will who now entertain hopes of surviving the world catastrophe of Armageddon into the “new earth”. One thing is sure: If you accept the truth, you are going to be persecuted and suffer tribulation for it. You cannot escape it in this world, and especially in this “time of the end”. (2 Tim. 3:12) To be right you are obliged to line up on the side of Jehovah’s rightful sovereignty by his kingdom. To do this by associating with Jehovah’s witnesses and by publishing the Kingdom message exposes you to persecution. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">After a very successful year of gathering together the “other sheep” in God’s organization Jehovah’s witnesses do not settle back and say, “Well, this is enough. We have gathered in great gains.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 4:3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not how time has been spent in the past that marks one as a profitable or unprofitable servant, but how one is spending it now and in the future. One cannot mix service of God with careless living. The Devil is well aware of the inherent weaknesses of the flesh; he knows every cunning device to trip the unwary. That is why Paul stressed the need of keeping the body under</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Iso. 3o: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely this is a most joyful occupation, to help God’s little ones, to see the knees of those who are weak get strong so they can carry the servant on in the service, to note the hands and arms which hung down limp get stronger until they commence to use them in the employ of others. Yes, to really see an inactive person become active is a joy. Those found handling their brethren with kindness and considera-and to live off his gains and just eat, drink and be merry. Not at all! They want to plant more seed and cultivate the field again and again. So, as the Scriptures indicate, one will plant, another water, but it is God who makes it grow. (1 Cor. 3:7) They sow in order that they may reap; and as God prospers their efforts, more people come into his organization, seeking refuge and safety. Even those newly coming to the organization in time go out too to sow and water, looking to God to make it grow and give increase at harvest. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">subjection at all times, not catering to selfish and carnal desires nor allowing the mind to dwell upon such things. Better to refrain from spending time with the works of the flesh now than to spend eternity in Gehenna. Each step a Christian takes should be weighed against the requirements of God. (Ps. 37:23) It is far better to take a few moments for quiet reflection, fully considering God’s requirements before rushing into an action that might bring God’s reproof. “To act without reflection is not good; and to be over-hasty is to miss the mark.”—Prov. 19:2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AT.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">2/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tion, therefore obtaining results, will surely be granted further gracious opportunities of service. Does not Jehovah know they will be careful, diligent and dependable, always trying to build and strengthen the brethren? Let us take to heart the dealings of Jehovah with each of us and so deal with the fearful and timid ones in like manner. Resulting from these ministrations is the greater expansion of his service. All the faithful servants will so help each other to remain fearless to the end. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God deals with his people as a group or society, as he dealt with Israel in times of old.

Each is for all and all are for each. God has placed each one</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God has built up a universal organization of nis faithful creatures in heaven and earth. Various creatures he sets in position with special authority. These represent him, and for this reason they are to be respected. They have not assumed this authority themselves. They received it from schemes of men, above the insults, slanders, and revilings of this evil generation. God will preserve his Word, and no one can . destroy it; but how he rejoices and finds pleasure in those he can trust, the ones who have his spirit, who are as men agreeable to his own heart! The Lord Jesus knows from past service that his “faithful and wise slave” will be a loyal custodian of the Word, guarding it well, treating it as the most precious trust, magnifying it, suffering for it and even dying for it. He knows his own and has his confidence well placed. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in the organization as it pleased him. In an army not all can be officers, but privates do the great mass of working and fighting. All among his witnesses realize that the greatest position one can have in God’s organization is being a minister, teacher, preacher or publisher by telling others about God’s kingdom. Having this knowledge and feeling of equality of privileges, Jehovah’s witnesses are led toward unity. Unity and harmony of spirit, mind and work are accomplished by the active force or spirit of Jehovah God that hovers over his organization like a mighty canopy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

God set up the theocratic organization of the Christian congregation. He made Jesus of Nazareth Head of it and also stationed unlettered and ordinary men as apostles next to him in the organization. Since opposers take a stand against God’s arrangement, they subject themselves to direct judgment from him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">While each must bear his own load before God, he does at the same time have a responsibility toward others in tbe congregation. As we praise God ourselves, we cannot be unmindful of those associated with us in running the race of faith. If we have first in mind the vindication of Jehovah’s name and his universal sovereignty, then we will appreciate that the faithful, constant service of our fellow workers government over it. He determined to bring back a world of righteousness, a new world. At his due time he founded it or laid its foundation in the sacrificial death and resurrection of his Son Jesus Christ nineteen centuries ago. Now he has set up the heavenly government for this new world, appointing his self-sacrificing Son to be its king. He has done this, although most of earth’s people have not wanted Christ Jesus as King, a fact which proves this is no democratic arrangement but a theocratic one. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">they stay in this old world, following God’s Word carefully, if they are to gain final approval of the Life-giver in heaven. We can lose all his blessings if we go back to the futile way of living in which we were brought up before we knew the truth and made our consecration. With the pay we receive now from Jehovah we find the divine protection. We are in an evil world that seeks to destroy all that honors Jehovah’s name.

Because we are strong, we cannot become impatient with those among us wno are weak, nor can we brush them aside as of little importance in God’s arrangement </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ was a perfect example of a full-time pioneer minister. He fully realized the hopeless condition of the Jews bound up in their religious traditions, and so did everything then possible to save them. During the time of Jesns and his apostles the gospel ministry expanded more and more. As others heard and responded, ‘out of their inmost parts streams of living water flowed’ after the holy spirit required to sell all that he had in order to obtain this field. The members of the body of Christ, who are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, are called upon to follow in his steps and required to do so. They, too, are required to sell all they have in order to be with him in the Kingdom. The same consuming joy is set before them and it must inspire them with the same unalterable determination that no sacrifice is too great or obstruction too difficult for them to overcome to have a part in this reward to which Jehovah invited them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">new world. But before laying down his life, what work did he take up as pleasing to God and of highest importance? To what did he devote himself as being the most pressing need of the people facing destruction? At the appointed time marked out in prophecy he took up preaching. Though he knew it would lead to a martyr’s death in public disgrace, he devoted himself to spreading the knowledge of Jehovah God. He thus established preaching God’s Word as being the highest vocation. We can enjoy no privilege higher than to preach. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was poured out on the day of Pentecost A.D. 33. This water in turn reached others who also responded. And so on until about forty years later, when Jerusalem was destroyed. Then Jehovah did not hold those early ministers blood-guilty. They had sounded the warning, resulting in salvation for those heeding it and destruction for those scoffing. Today the Watch Tower Society shows the same concern for this generation now facing world destruction at Armageddon. It fulfills God’s purpose to sound a warning by sending his witnesses forth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A tale repeated, regardless of how good the intentions, becomes busybodying and gossiping. The tongue, most difficult to control, will not long be content with mere repetition. Use care then; ‘take need to your ways that you sin not with your tongue.’ (Ps. 39:1) The tongue cannot praise God and at the same time malign a brother; neither can time be spent praising God and also making the stones cry out. He did, however, choose to use an anointed remnant of the “little flock” to do the work of putting the enemy to flight. Later, as more of the “other sheep” class are taken into the fighting ranks, some may lament that they were not informed sooner about these Bible truths, that they could have had a fuller share in the gospelpreaching work. But they appreciate the reason for what seemed to them a tardy call to service, when they learn of Jehovah’s purpose first to gather, sift and judge an anointed remnant.—1 Pet. 4:17. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in their self-willed independent spirit.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That consummation reached its end A.D. 70 with the destruction of old Jerusalem and its temple and the scattering of the Jewish nation for almost nineteen centuries. The system of Mosaic law and its animal sacrifices and oblations offered by priests of the tribe of Levi ended, for thus the priests were forcibly deprived of their sacrificial work by the destruction of their typical temple,</span></p>

Many are farmers, carpenters, fishers and factory laborers by trade and training. Peter and Andrew and other apostles were fishers by education. Luke was a physician by schooling. Jesus, which has continued unrestored till this very day. Although the old world kept standing, certain systems of things ended there, to make way for new ones. Again the apostle speaks to prove this. He tells of the faithless acts of the Jews and the punishments that befell them for it in the wilderness after they were saved from Egypt. Then he remarks: “Now these things went on befalling them as examples and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the accomplished ends of the systems of things have arrived.” (1 Cor. 10:11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">So we are living under new systems. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">slaves of God and owe him our undivided service.

We delight to commend him to all and to correct others’ misunderstanding of him. “Publicly and from house to house” we let our praise of him be heard. We have no encomiums for the “golden calf’ of commercialism or for political and military gods of the nations.

In each and every one of these eases it was Jehovah’s holy spirit or active force upon them that enabled them to take up their new assignments and carry them out as Jehovah’s special servants. They cultivated the gifts that they received, and Jehovah blessed them. The same holy spirit of God will be upon any servant of his today if he willingly accepts his assignment and diligently works at it, trying faithfully to do his duty. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life.”—John 8:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A special feature of the celebration of the feast of tabernacles was the lighting of clusters of lamps in the court of the women each night. These lamps made a brilliant light that could be seen a considerable distance. They pictured the spiritual light from God’s temple. It is possible that Jesus made the above statement the day after the feast was upon another who would have to carry it. Each must bear his personal responsibility before God. (Gal. 6:5) Besides assisting their weaker brethren and the people of good will, Jehovah’s witnesses decline to put burdens upon them. They live up to the name by conducting Bible studies and making revisits upon the people of good will and visiting the sick and infirm without charge. Money received from those willing and able to contribute is used to print and distribute other literature. Thus no heavy burden is bound upon any. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

It brings stagnation, perhaps providing obstacles to being received into the new world. Those who are fearful are in a continual condition of anxiety and worry about many things that never happen. Needless to say, many do not take Jehovah at his word and cast all their cares upon him. So they are unhappy because always fearful about something that might happen. The truth sets free from such fears. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">over A.D. 32. At that time the bright temple lights were now out and gave no light to anyone, so the people would then walk in darkness; but the light Jesus gave would shine forever, for he gave the light of life. Psalm 119:105 said: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” This light shining from the Word is from God and is reflected by Jesus Christ. It now guides his people through this dark world, till they reach the new world of righteousness, where there will be no darkness of error to blind God’s redeemed ones. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some may hold back from preaching because of timidity or fear. Jeremiah surmounted that obstacle.

Theological training in a religious seminary does not equip one for Jehovah’s service now, no more than it did in Jesus’ day when he and the apostles confounded such trained ones. Private study of the Bible and group study with other witnesses, plus Jehovah’s spirit, give ability to answer second to none! “Thy commands make me wiser than my foes; I am never without them. I have more insight than all these oracles, for I muse on thine injunctions!

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To be faithful in our service we must use our Kingdom interests so they will increase. Try to double them. All servants of God are entrusted with some Kingdom service, large or small.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah, the great Theocrat, understands all things and gives understanding to his faithful servants as they need it.

The One wiser than the writer of Proverbs said to the Holy One: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of power. No, for it is the loving-kindness of God that grants this treasured knowledge. Then what are we doing with this interest? Are we increasing in knowledge and understanding? It grows with use, it does not increase by hiding it. Then we have interests in magazine advertising, back-calls on interested persons, Bible studies and other field service. Then the congregational services must be attended to. Every servant, every pioneer, all serving in the Society’s institutions have Kingdom interests.

So we gladly accept the Son of God. For us to reject him means we are cutting ourselves off from the central connection with God, the one channel of life from God; and this would likewise spell utter destruction for us. How beneficial to take in right knowledge! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the one whom yon sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW}</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> This knowledge of the Holy One means much more than just a mental idea of his existence. It means a proved knowledge of Jehovah and of his purposes, a knowledge which resists any and all efforts to upset it. It means an understanding of him and an appreciation of why he does the things he does. This proved, tried and unupsettable knowledge is something to be striven for. Because of it we pay attention to what God teaches us, and this increases our understanding of him and our relationship to him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

To do such work means that the individual will be content and happy and will always have something that is truly worth-while. The only way that true godliness can be of great gain to us is if it is combined with contentment. Our mind and heart as well as our body must be used in preaching the Word.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">After Kingdom publishers distribute Bible literature, they follow through by calling back on the obtainers, to answer questions, to conduct home Bible studies, to show interested ones how to preach, to spring them from bondage of this old world into the prospects of freedom in a new world of righteousness. Theocratic ministers know that the truth of the Bible is likened to water, and that it may be said that or for Jehovah’s witnesses to be deported from the country, as if these witnesses were living on soil where they did not belong. In fact, they would deport them from the face of the earth. But Jehovah’s faithful servants are the only ones with a right to occupy the earth. God will demonstrate that right in the battle between the Lamb and the worldly nations. There Jehovah will clear the earth of these fanatical superpatriots of this world and let only his witnesses survive into the new world where all will pay back to God the things belonging to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Kingdom has been set up and now we have a reigning King. This certainly makes a difference, and so we take orders from our King. We are theocratic. We are proclaiming the good news of God’s government, and we have renounced a deceitful tongue. We are not peddlers of God’s Word who misrepresent their product in order to deceive customers and make sales for self-enrichment at the people’s expense. We boldly declare the truth and let its simple purity recommend the truth to every honest seeker of truth and right. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">within the covers of a Bible help is a reservoir of such water. Moreover, when water remains dammed up and motionless it becomes stale, stagnant ; it must flow like a stream to be clear and sparkling. So ministers call back, encourage obtainers to open the publications, let the message on the page free to flow through the eye into the mind and fill the heart. If the truth waters have been befouled and polluted by lying shepherds, the back-calling minister can settle the dirt peddled by mudslingers and clear up the waters, to stream sparkling clear. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

Today, after seventy-one years of publication, our Brooklyn presses run off about 1,200,000 copies of each issue.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our heavenly Father rejoices to see us fruitful. He is pleased, therefore, to bestow everlasting life upon us in the new world. It is for gaining this life that we receivers of his Word must be fruitful now before Armageddon. But not only is our own new world life involved with our productivity. Through our fruit bearing God is also pleased to confer life upon others upon whom he uses us to scatter the seed and who</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The end of the “appointed times of the nations” in 1914 meant just the reverse of what their beginning did in 607 B.C. So in 1914 God Almighty took again to himself his power. He began ruling as king, not at earthly Jerusalem or over the former promised land of Palestine, but over all the earth and all its nations. He did this in remembrance of his kingdom covenant with David notice of governments of every political shade who have resorted to banning Jehovah’s witnesses and their Bible literature, dissolving their local organizations, committing them to prisons, concentration camps, exile and execution; but, in the face of such worldwide antagonism, a movement to make the name of the living true God known and famous throughout the earth, advertising his kingdom by Christ, announcing his righteous new world, and drawing together in a oneness of belief and a unity of action Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">likewise become fruitful manyfold to God’s glory and vindication. Though the coming battle of Armageddon will wipe out and uproot every ungodly plant which our heavenly Father has not planted, it will not destroy the precious fruits of our righteousness in preaching his Word and advancing the interests of his kingdom by Christ. In the time yet remaining before Armageddon may he continue to cultivate us as his ministers and constantly renew our strength to endure and bring forth more fruit for his vindication and our own eternal life in his new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

Not as King on a material throne in an earthly Jerusalem, but on the “throne of Jehovah” which is in heaven and where Jesus had been sitting waiting for all his foes to be made his footstool. “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool,” says Jehovah. So since 1914 is the time for the nations to be no longer on top but underfoot, to be trampled on by the heavenly Rulers till they are ground to powder at Armageddon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Phil. 2:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s name is being made known in all the world. The good news of the Kingdom is everywhere being preached. Multitudes are being taught the commandments. The warning to the wicked is being given and the end of this world proclaimed. The marking of those to be spared at Armageddon goes on. The “other sheep” are being gathered into one fold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By exercising love toward one another Jehovah’s witnesses live np to the name of Jehovah which is on them, for he is a God of love. They show their love by helping one another. They know the law requires them to love their neighbor. While people of good will are their neighbors, their closest neighbor is their brother. With a brother they avoid petty jealousies and other misraising them from the dead and conferring life upon them for their unfaltering loyalty. Will those he makes “princes” be limited to such pre-Christian witnesses? No! The “other sheep” who now manifest their faith and integrity to the full will become children of the King Jesus Christ, just as much so as the faithful ancients who preceded Christ. Since they manifest a similarity of faith, nothing Scrip-turally argues against his taking as many of these “other sheep” as he requires and making them “princes through all the land”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kingdom Signal is raised on high, the road prepared for the returning exiles. The sheep are protected against aggressive, ruthless men and those who would harm their eternal interests. The barren places in the world are blossoming, for where only a few years ago one or two persons were praising Jehovah now there are hundreds, yes, and thousands. Blind eyes are being opened, deaf ears unstopped, the dumb tongue unloosened, and the lame can leap. These miracles now being wrought in the spiritual sense will be realized literally in the new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">understandings. Having in mind the Kingdom interests they do not resent the added privileges that are given another; they rejoice to see another brother put into a position of special service privileges. By loving their closest neighbor as well as themselves, they live up to the name. Their God is a God of peace and order. Hence his witnesses work so as to avoid faultfinding, murmuring and complaining against one another. They avoid fights with one another over personal or petty matters. They let nothing divide them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

However, deal kindly and not dogmatically, or with a domineering attitude. A little reasoning on some of these matters, with time taken out to explain, will be time well spent and reap its own</span></p>

It might be argued that Paul thought the time was short away back rewards. Do not hastily brush aside their problems and seemingly great barriers, but try to understand their attitude, and help them. Remember that the timid ones want the assurance that everything will be all right if they go on, not a blunt word that they should not fear; for very often they know that themselves. Sometimes those who have been the fearful ones become firm loyal soldiers of Christ, having learned that their own lack of strength to go forward in God’s service necessitated complete dependence upon him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">only key that throws wide the doors to mental freedom! Did not Jesus say, “Know the truth, and the truth will set you free”? The most vital truth is that contained in God’s Word, the Bible. Do you doubt that? If Scripture truths were known and followed there could be no racial prejudice, religious hate, national greed, no juvenile delinquency nor adult crime nor international wars. It would be a changed society, a new society. Bible truth would free the mind from Satanic captivity and give it a new outlook that would reveal what would be really good, pleasing and perfect for mankind. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

Perhaps several generations will yet come and go before God’s wrath is expressed. Such a conclusion should be hastily dismissed from mind, for Jesus further said, when speaking of the signs: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;This generation </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” (Matt. 24:34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is the generation </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> are living in that is primarily concerned.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God has given his spirit in abundance to his servants and with that has come a supply of spiritual food and knowledge of his purposes that we cannot contain. When we are working hard we use more of the food and we appreciate it more. It gives us added strength to stick to our work. The strength God gives us to endure in this old world is beyond the world’s understand-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To be guarded and retained, understanding must be cherished, preserved, and striven for. No issue pertaining to Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ should be let arise without getting a proper understanding and view of it. What is God’s purpose about it? What is my theocratic responsibility toward it? No price is too great to pay for understanding. Solomon, the highly praised servant ing. It sees that as an organization Jehovah’s witnesses are sticking to their work under any and all conditions, in the face of the violence of persecution and war. The efforts made to stop the work would ordinarily bring an end to the activities of any group. We know it is only Jehovah’s help that makes it possible for us to endure, and so we do not boast in ourselves. Thus we can endure, we find ourselves able to persevere, we can continue, we can stick to our work. It is the only wise thing to do now. The time is so near. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">er’s misstep.

We will not increase his burden by going to others and whispering just what his difficulties are and wherein he has erred, not. if we love him and want to help him as one of God’s sheep. We will try to visualize ourselves in the same position and then we will act toward him as we would want to be dealt with if we made the same mistake. This is the gist of the apostle’s advice at Galatians 6:1. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah, lost his understanding, which at one time was so precious and important to him. He set his affections on other things than Jehovah. This leaning to his own will corrupted his understanding and he died condemned of God. (1 Ki. 11:1-11) This teaches that no other creature, be that one as near and as dear as a wife, can be permitted to come between the servant and his God. Solomon was properly warned of the consequence of his course but chose to ignore it. This was a serious step and denoted that corrupted understanding had set in. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah is conducting a Government school of success. There is nothing else on earth like it. Since it graduated a Master Instructor, Christ Jesus, it has been in operation for nineteen hundred years. The wonderful course it offers through him is an education and training for life through all eternity to come. You will not graduate from this school until you have proved yourself worthy of the right to everlasting life. Gaining this right is the measure of a person’s real success, and it is a credit to the School Instructors and a lasting joy and blessing to the successful graduate. Success is really to be measured in terms of living, and not in the fleeting superficial things of the world. (Matt. 16:26) To what greater success could anyone attain than to gain endless life in happiness, that with it he might serve the God who bestows this prize? Next to that, what sweeter privilege could we have than to help someone else to gain such life with us? None. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Add something to your service. Do not be trying to show the Master how to do his business, but get busy with those interests committed to your care. If only all his servants would put the same thought, planning, enthusiasm, hard work, alacrity, in the new world’s service as they do in their own worldly affairs, then they would reap 100 per cent</span></p>

Those taught in this school are blessed with peace and prosperity and arc kept from the selfish, deadly conflicts of this old world. Let us see to it, therefore, that our teachers are not men with their dead precepts, traditions and worldly philosophies, but the two great Instructors of the universe, Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

Do not let your personal business matters and other affairs hinder yonr handling his interests that they may increase. Accept your responsibilities and do not wait for someone to urge you on, but go forward yourself. You are one of the Lord’s servants.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ps. 35:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has always been interested in the poor and helpful to them. Christians should be too. The favor of God does not go with the oppressor of the poor. To know that he will protect the poor against the oppressor, the strong, the rich and the mighty is surely a comfort. Good men will help the poor. The poor love life the same as all other folks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Faith is a requirement. Jesus surpassed ns all in this quality. Without it it is impossible to win God’s good pleasure. (Heb. 11:6) With it the servant’s mind and heart are in the right attitude for understanding and are quick to respond when enlightened. Jesus was a true servant, fired with a zeal that caused him to work at his Father’s service as did no other. When he entered God’s full-time service on earth, his faith was sufficient</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday, September 6 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For God gave us not a spirit of cowardioe, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.—2 Tim. 1: 7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Threats are made by the workers of darkness against the children of light to try to intimidate and if possible bring fear so that they will desist from spreading light. Nevertheless, God’s displeasure will be made manifest if we shirk responsibilities because of fear. (Prov. 29:25) A mighty work has to be performed before this old world is destroyed. No time is this for fleeing when no one is pursuing, but the Christian, bold as a lion, stands fast in the knowledge of the supremacy of his God and devotes his time to profitable pursuits. Perfect love casts out fear, leaving the mind free to think clearly and direct the body in profitable works of praise. (Prov. 28: 1; 1 John 4: 18) One who is interested in having more time to devote to profitable works casts aside worldly cares and fears God alone. Rather than halt or interrupt your work for fear, _ “oppose the Devil, and he will fiee from you.”— Jas. 4 : 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW. W 2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that he left his support completely at the disposal of his Father in heaven. By faithfully preaching he found that those who listened to him were in many cases willing and anxious for him to dine with them. While dining Jesus imparted spiritual food far more valuable than the material food he consumed. He was not particular about his lodging for the night, but slept anywhere Jehovah provided, whether under the stars, in a stable, or in a home. He said: “The Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” What faith !—Matt. 8: 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW. W 4/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hesitation, timidity or fearfulness, but a time for going forward. This is a time for courageous action and marvelous expansion on the part of all true servants of God. The whole world and the invisible evil powers are exerting every effort to prevent this prosperity. Every expression of hatred is being and will be raised to create barriers, but such obstacles will not succeed. “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.”—Isa. 54:17. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Friday, September 7 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled . . , And the men of Israel gathered themselves together . . . and pursued.—Judg. 7:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Was it not after the death of Egypt’s firstborn by the tenth plague that the mixed multitude of good will is shown marching out with the Israelites? (Ex. 12:38) And after the killing of the Midianite power by Gideon’s rout of them that large reinforcements joined the three hundred? So it is after the antitypical tenth</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the feast of tabernacles all Israelites were to live in huts made from boughs of “goodly trees”. This is significant. A booth is a temporary dwelling place while the occupants are looking for a permanent home. On the journey from Egypt to the promised land the Israelites dwelt in booths. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob dwelt in booths in their day. They did not wish to be</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">be slack.—Zeph. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">You are engaged in a constructive work for the new world now at the portals. This upbuilding work is the service to which the new world’s Creator has assigned us. You are pioneers of the new world ! Always let ring in your ears the divine encouragement, “Fear not!” and, “Droop not your hands!” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Mo.)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> And oh! what constructive implements the heavenly Father has put into plague and rout begins that the “other sheep” class flock forward to join the anointed remnant. The truth concerning the “higher powers” as being God and Christ was made clear in 1928 and 1929, and since then that pointed truth has been repeatedly wielded as an important part of the “sword of the spirit”. As the message penetrates to new lands thousands more take up the fight, showing that this world is a dead thing to them, void of any life hopes. Like Ephraim-ites in Midian’s day, they take the battle stations assigned them by the organizational head of the antitypical three hundred. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">part of Satan’s world, but looked for a government that would be controlled by Jehovah. They confessed they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. (Heb. 11: 8-16) Jesus said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” So all those who are looking for God’s kingdom as their hope are not permanent dwellers in this evil world and do not consider themselves a part of it. They do not devote their time and energies accumulating worldly riches. These will all be swept away completely at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">our hands! These were meant for work, for our use to the full. The field of action to which we go forth, and the future stretching ahead of us till Armageddon, are not the place and time for us to slack our hands, either through laziness or through fear. Know for certain: the time is short! Lift up your hands and put them to work with a will. Only if we fulfill the work for which God has gathered us will he grant us a share in the fulfillment of his precious promise: “I will make you a name and a praise among all people.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:39, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When we carelessly drift back to the old world's ways and become ensnared in any of Satan’s many pits or traps we suffer the untold miseries that we bring upon ourselves. Very pitiful is the state into which failing to stick to God’s work and his organization has led some individuals. That is what Satan will bring upon those who give him an opening by pausing to associate again with</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah is our king; he will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">save us.—Isa. 33: 22, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How strange it is that earth’s inhabitants do not want as their King the Creator of the earth and of man upon it! Not the men of this atomic age, but God is the One who pre-eminently knows how to run the earth and can regulate it for mankind’s good, keeping a perfect balance between all forces in and about the earth. Satan the Devil has misused all these forces. He has exercised only the “means to cause death”. There is no life in him</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, September 12 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his steps closely.—1 Pet. 2:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses preach as did the primitive followers of Jesus. They have a far grander privilege than the early disciples, because they are now advertising in this “time of the end” the complete fulfillment of all that has been written in the Bible. They accept the responsibility imposed by God and the Lord Jesus Christ to declare now the good news of God's kingdom over all the old world: mental suffering, misery, unhappiness. Bur if we truly love God we will turn to him and seek his help, as a child will go to its father. When we sincerely repent and seek to go in the right way. getting back into God’s work and determining to stick to it, there is Jehovah to help us to recover. At the very least, the period of suffering is certain to be a most difficult time —there are many who never recover—and so the wise servant of Jehovah will keep his vision of the issue clear and will stick to his work, not taking any risks with his life in the new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or through anything he has established. As “ruler of this world” and as “god of this system of things” he has failed. It has not meant life or good government for us, but the direct opposite. Now a lifegiving change is under way. The settling of the age-old issue of universal sovereignty will shortly take place at Armageddon. Jehovah our God the Almighty now reigns as King of earth and heaven. He is the Conqueror who has ousted the Devil from heaven and will shortly destroy that one’s world and create a new world of life and joy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the earth. They have answered the great challenge of preaching this gospel in all the world as a witness to all nations by employing modern inventions, such as radio, the printing press and modern transportation, to supplement their primitive method. This sharing of the truth with others they do without financial reward. It is only by this wise course, as sons of God, that they can have a part in vindicating Jehovah’s name and live up to the name as his witnesses, making glad his heart, that he may answer his reproachers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We can pay back “Caesar’s” things conscientiously to “Caesar” while at the same time paying back God’s things to God. In view of Jesus’ words and the apostle’s instruction, this course denotes our subjection to the “superior authorities”.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Remnant and “other sheep” will together make it safely to the new world, no matter how desperately Satan’s old world tries to destroy us. It can no more prevent us from surviving the battle of Armageddon into the new world than it can block or destroy the new heavens and earth. Jehovah’s now preparing of a nucleus of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The seed of God’s Word is not dead but is a living force. It has power to bring preaching abilities and activities to the surface, so causing a crop of Kingdom proclamation to be reaped by the great Sower. By the divine Word and spirit within us God creates the fruit of our lips. (Isa. 57:19) The “good soil” heart with the der them. To “Caesar” we will render what is due him for services he renders us, but we will not let him crowd in upon our worship of the Most High by decrees against God’s arrangement. To persons in prominent places within “Caesar’s” organization we will give due and proper respect, but will do so with fear of God. (Matt. 10:28) Peter writes: “Honor men of all kinds, have love for the whole association of brothers, be in fear of God, have honor for the king.” (1 Pet. 2:17, 2VW) In the fear of God we will honor his King clothed with new world authority. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New World society will never be in vain. Hid by his powerful hand in the days of his anger against the doomed old world, this nucleus will go through Armageddon, just as Noah and his household went through the Flood, hid in the ark. You survivors of Armageddon will be the first on the field of action in the “new earth”. But what we want is that when, after Armageddon, we do emerge from the ark of hiding we will emerge organized. So let us keep theocratic organization and let God continue improving it as a New World society. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">living seed implanted in it is deeply stirred and it moves the vocal cords and tongue and lips into action to “preach the word”. Fruitage thus produced is proof that the person is of the “good soil” class and that he is in very fact a minister of God’s Word. His producing Kingdom fruit wins the great Sower’s approval and makes it possible for the Sower to scatter more seed upon other hearers. Thus through his followers he continues sowing the precious seed. So God “will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow”.—2 Cor. 9:10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW. W 18/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This is no local call to praise God. It is a universal appeal to all creation to join in singing Jehovah’s praise. Today all of us who have heard the truth, by God’s mercy and loving-kindness, must be constantly aware of the fact that he is allowing this brief interval of time between the enthroning of his King and the violent outbreak of Armageddon so that “this good news of the king-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Often it is a trivial thing, a matter not worthy of the time it eventually consumes, that hinders the work of a Christian or the congregation of Christians. Little misunderstandings are certain to arise as long as men are imperfect. The adversary will see to it that they do.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers are cultivated by God for his work of advertising his Kingdom and warning of the battle of Armageddon. This is the acceptable time for all who can to join the pioneer ranks. Never was the need for them so great, nor the time so short and the harvest to be reaped so plentiful. If you have been called out of darkness indom” may be preached to all earth’s inhabitants. All men that know Jehovah must praise him now, so that maximum opportunity is afforded others or good will to learn of him and join in the praising. Every available instrument must be pressed into service to sound out his glories. No one must shirk his privilege of joining in the “Hallelujah” chorus, for the only creation that will survive to all eternity will be that which renders unceasing praise in this “day of Jehovah” and forever beyond its terrible climax. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">son becomes divided. Instead of thinking on ways to buy out opportunities to serve God, it dwells upon the fancied wrong. Time once profitably spent is now wasted in feeling sorry for self. Sympathy is required; others must be told; the time of others must be consumed. An unwary person, hearing this tale of abuse, may take sides in the difficulty and what was once a trivial matter may sweep through the congregation like a conflagration, disrupt the orderly and profitable service of God and give rise to charges and countercharges, publicly aired.

The more time you spend in reflecting the light, the brighter your reflector becomes and the more brilliant your light, and the more are attracted to the truth. The day of Jehovah is far spent and the night of Armageddon is very near. Do not be caught napping and in a state of indifference toward those who are in world bondage. Hear the call for more and more pioneers of good news. Feel the urgent need, and then respond. Imitate Jesus in his pioneer activities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The witness given since 1914 has steadily increased the sway of the Kingdom in the lives of men of good will. It could not have been otherwise. Over God’s own name the above prophecy was long ago declared, and this must come true, though now the King rules in the midst of multitudinous enemies. The irresisti-er, the faithful and true servant of Jehovah, would take. Moses the prophet also manifested exemplary meekness and looked to Jehovah for understanding and direction, and for this the Lord God used Moses mightily. (Num. 12:3) However, the greatest example we have in seeking understanding and in applying it is, of course, Jesus of Nazareth. By not seeking his own will he did not mar his wisdom and understanding. “Christ Jesus . . . has become to us wisdom from God.” (1 Cor. 1: 30, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> We do well, therefore, to give particular attention to the example he has set for us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are brought out, they not only enjoy that truth themselves but think how they can use that knowledge in their own preaching work. They are “doers of the word, and not hearers only”. (Jas. 1:22) They fill up with the waters of truth that gush forth at meetings, but as they do they keep eyes and ears open to service opportunities in which they can let truth flow to others. As they themselves learn, the desire to tell others builds up. Then they get relief by opening their lips and letting the message bubble out for others to enjoy. So Jehovah uses them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ble zeal of Jehovah of hosts will never let his prophetic Word be shoved back unperformed into his face and the increase of the government of his Son be blocked successfully. The Kingdom witness must go on increasing. Through the knowledge spread abroad by Jehovah’s witnesses the people of good will everywhere can have the opportunity to know of the only Righteous Government and can gather round it as the only hope of mankind. They can give it their unqualified allegiance before Jehovah’s King destroys his foes. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

Is there not something in it, something material they will gain by being his witnesses? No, the only thing to gain, as far as being one of them is concerned, is treasure in heaven. They are trying to be rich in good works so as to “get a firm hold on the real life”. How do they do this? By spending their time it becomes our duty toward God to resist the impure-minded persons who try to sneak in and lure unsuspecting Christians into sexual abuses by wrongly claiming God’s mercy for willful sins. Let the evil-designing sneaks and all worldly persons know what high moral principles the true knowledge of God and Christ stands for. Let the world know the position of morality that Jehovah’s theocratic organization takes, that they may know it is a pure organization. Keep the organization that way, as far as in you lies.

So we need to be fearless and to adhere strictly to what God has commanded and tanght us.

There is danger in being indecisive, pausing on the way to life. We are wise when we understand that once we have made a consecration to serve God there is never any question about how to decide matters. We play safe by making our decisions always in favor of God’s work and in harmony with his Word. Jesus gave us a good example of how</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As the visible theocratic organization increases, the new strength of numbers is dedicated to Jehovah’s honor. They are not held under as a laity class to bear up and support a clergy class. There are no class distinctions or discriminations or respect of persons shown in the visible organization; all are under God and Christ.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who are strong caunot please themselves as to their course of conduct, for they must help the weaker ones. How easy for the strong ones to say to the timid and fearful ones, Stand aside and let me go on ! Or to lose patience with the Lord’s “other sheep”, and, because they themselves can go boldly forward, think that every one else should and it is just too bad if they cannot. No, to proceed when the Devil tempted him in the wilderness. He knew what the Scriptures said, so he used them as his vehicle for reply. The Devil could not make him change from his positive attitude of mind. We must likewise watch out that our fleshly desires or other creatures are not permitted to influence us unreasonably to keep us away from our theocratic activities. It is necessary to stick close to God and his organization to be safe. Our minds must be trained through study of his Word if we are to stick to our work. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

So taught from above, all Jehovah’s ministers can say: “Wisdom is better than strength . . . better than weapons of war.” Without carnal weapons they will encircle this religionized old world that lies in darkness and loves it. They will let the truth torch shine, lift up their voice like a trumpet, shout out the praises of God and courageously wield the “sword of the spirit” with the battle cry: “For Jehovah and his Greater Gideon!” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it cannot be this way for God’s devoted ones. The responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the anointed remnant and their companions to strengthen the weaker ones, and not push them to one side. The timid ones should not be bruised or hurt or loaded with further handicaps. It must not be that way. Obey God’s command above. Then instruct and explain, showing reason for not being afraid. Strengthen them in the knowledge of the truth; give them the assurance they need. Point to the true Deliverer. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ is the invisible Head of this “faithful steward” or slave, and all must recognize it. His most vital Kingdom interests on earth are not just passed over or simply given away to the slave class to do with just as they wish. No, it is not like that at all. The “belongings” are still those of Christ Jesus, the Master, and he puts them in the slave’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s zeal is drawing close. But not without warning from the God of love and mercy. In this time of the end he has kept his promise and turned a “pure language” to the peoples who long for truth and righteousness. He has not left himself nameless, but has revealed his identity in order that the people may know to whom to turn through Christ. He has through the theocratic organization of his anointed witnesses been clearing up the Bible truth and purifying their speech.

Living up to the name of their God will continue to mean arrests, cruelties and injuries inflicted at the hands of demonized men. It will mean even the loss of life to some of the faithful; but this does not dismay them. The threat or even the danger of loss of life does not stop them or slow them down. They believe with all their heart, soul, mind and strength Jesus’ words: “Whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">care, in his custody. They are handed over as a trust. Furthermore, would it not be strange if Christ had more than one “faithful and discreet slave”? Suppose he had two, or more, and each contended he had the rulership over the belongings. There would be confusion; and God is not the author of confusion. There is only one Most High Jehovah, one Lord Jesus Christ, one holy spirit. There are not two Christs, and neither are there two anointed companies. So today there is only one “faithful and discreet slave” class entrusted with his belongings. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

Not only is the mind thus occupied too busy for the Devil to tempt and trip up, but constant activity improves the efficiency of the preacher so that more can be accomplished in the available time.

Now God is calling his people out of antitypical Egypt under his greater Moses, Christ Jesus. No life of luxury in abundance and ease is promised to these now. But there is ample of what they need most to sustain them. What? It is a table of not spent in praising God, but time is also consumed in regaining past efficiency. The remaining time is too short to permit such losses; and there is the ever-present danger of being completely swallowed up in the old world. What has been done or what we have failed to do in the past cannot be changed. That time is, gone, it cannot be used again. But in the present and in the future are yet many opportunities awaiting the one who would serve God.

By casting the invisible king of mystic Babylon, Satan the Devil, and his demon organization out of the.heavenly heights from association with the holy angels and down to God’s footstool, the earth.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Since Jesus’ resurrection from death and his glorification in heaven he is “The Ruler of the kings of the earth”. He is indeed an object of fear to those doing evil, but he is an encourager of those doing good according to God’s will. These have no fear of him in his position of authority since 1914, but good-will persons of all nations are led to rest their hope in him. (Rom. 15:12; Rev. 1:5) For doing good in obedience to God’s Word we do receive praise, so that we know we have the divine approval and blessing. Because the “other sheep” do good to the anointed witnesses who are Christ’s brothers, the King Jesus Christ calls them “you who have my Father’s blessing”. (Matt. 25:34,40, All<sup>7</sup>) So in the strictest sense the Ruler Jesus Christ is God’s minister or servant for our highest good, lie assures us of his approval despite persecution by world rulers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

It was a sure promise, but it meant that the individual must follow God’s commandments and walk in them. As far as the provisions of life are concerned, God guarantees these the year round to those who walk in his statutes. In the very beginning of creation Jehovah provided all the necessary things for man, and they were for all in abundance.

All normal persons should want to seek the favor of the new King, especially if all must eventually submit to his rule or perish. Common sense dictates this as the wise course, because it is for one’s benefit and glorifies God. It upholds his universal sovereignty against the Devil’s false charges and assaults. As Jehovah’s witnesses keep on preaching the Kingdom gospel, more and more people hear the sound of the great crowd saying: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” It is high time for all hearers to act upon this call to praise him as their personal King whom they have chosen to worship and serve forever.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Prov. 22:6, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not say: ‘I will not fill his young mind with ideas that would make him unpopular with his neighborhood playmates, and for this reason I will not encourage my child to serve God now, but will wait until he is grown ; then he can decide for himself.’ Is this true love for the child? True love would be to take the course that would benefit the child most, over the longest period of time. At Armageddon’s slaughter old and young alike will not be spared. Therefore no guarantee is given that a child will pass through Armageddon by reason of the parent with a field-service record but who is careless toward his own children. In fact, the parent might be zealous and faithful on every point except that of offering his own children freely in God’s service. The selfish love held for a child might cause a parent to try to protect it from the adversary’s rebukes which come to all who stand for the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus did not preach one thing and do another. His course of action was consistent with his words. Everything he had Jesus gave up for the sake of the Kingdom, even to life itself. But he gave up a great deal before his life was given in sacrifice. First he gave up his heavenly existence as the Master Worker and Spokesman of the Creator. Then consider his earthly prospects. This brilliant young man (indeed his mind was perfect) might have devoted his time to advancing science, to lengthening the life span of people through medical and social researches, to building great cities with model housing or huge commercial organizations. With his perfect body he might have devoted his time to physical feats. Whatever he set his mind to he could undoubtedly have been the best. But Jesus turned his back upon all these things, and his decision hinged around what he, with perfect perception, considered to be the most profitable use of time. He preached. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

The time will not drag if spent in zealous work. Because of the love we have for God and his King and the Kingdom work the time separating us from Armageddon will seem as a fast stream of pleasant days. When those days are past the history of the final witness will be recorded, and that is a history that will not repeat itself. This world’s days are numbered, its hours are numbered, as God knows its final hour. Our hours for gospel-preaching are numbered with it. The Devil uses the short time remaining as a wild, raging, roaring lion seeking to prove his challenge; we should use our time as zealously for good as he uses his for evil. Gone will be the time for proving him a liar and sharing in the final witness when the great clock of God strikes and booms out the fateful hour of Armageddon !

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">If the Christian witnesses had been chosen by the worldly systems of Christendom, they would not now be witnesses of the Most High.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To be successful for life eternal we have to listen to God’s instruction through his theocratic organization and to abide by it even under circumstances of great stress. The heavenly Father likens his organization for teaching his children to a woman, a mother who is very devoted to her husband and to their children. He wants us to have respect for his educational organization. If we keep his fatherly instruction and comthe Bible instructions, dedicate themselves unconditionally to Jehovah God to do his will in imitation of Jesus. If Jehovah chooses to accept them and makes them his witnesses, then no religious system can upset God’s choice or accomplish anything by denying it and fighting against it. By separating from these “latter ones”, the vessels of common use lacking honor, a person proves he is consecrated or set apart for God’s sacred use. That way he is fit for Jehovah’s service, worthy of being “prepared for every good work” as Jehovah’s witness.—2 Tim. 2:20, 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vindication of Jehovah’s name. Paul the apostle deflated those looking to creatures as responsible for organizational increases by saying: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow; so that neither is he that plants anything nor is he that waters, but God who makes it grow.”(l Cor. 3 : 6, 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministers may plant the seed of truth and water it by calling back on interested persons and conducting home Bible studies, but it is God who gathers in new ones to give growth and increase to the visible organization of preachers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">mandment, not only will he be with us, but his “woman”, our “mother”, will also be with us. Every normal woman is attached to her children. (Isa. 49:15) God’s woman, or theocratic organization, is like him. She never forgets her children, those whom she teaches and brings forth as witnesses and representatives of her husband, the Most High God. We should show our love for her by not forsaking the law of our mother. It would be foolish to give up her law and treat it with contempt. “A foolish man de-spiseth his mother.”—Prov. 15: 20.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The foundation of a new world was truly laid in the sacrifice Jesus offered nineteen centuries ago. After his baptism in the Jordan he was anointed with God’s spirit to be the King of the new world, and by his integrity to God he proved his right to the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We must not let prejudice build up within us against another sister or brother in the company organization, so that we cannot speak to her or hear him speak without being overbalanced adversely to the extent of closing our mind to the good things from God's Word that he may be imparting to the congregation relative to our mutual service.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For whom were these seventy disciples working? Were they working for some human leader, even the great Jesus of Nazareth? Were they working for the people of good will upon whom they called and to whom they ministered? No. They were servants of the Almighty God, their Father in heaven. And he was the one who had guaranteed them food. Therefore all earthly accumulations would indicate lack of faith sufficient to trust Jehovah to the very end. The disciples dom of heaven but also those of mankind who would become his earthly subjects in the new world. Thus in a twofold sense the foundation of the new world was laid in Jesus’ perfect sacrifice. That he might one day be King enthroned in the government and that he might act as High Priest in applying the benefits of his human sacrifice, God raised Jesus Christ from death as an immortal spirit Son and ushered him into his heavenly presence. As a result, the foundation of the new world has stood solid and immovable until now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to sour our mental disposition and distort our thoughts. The resulting mental upset will not let us benefit from attending meetings. Instead of fixing our minds on the important things of God’s service, the united service is forgotten in favor of personal selfish inclinations. There is danger, too, that this attitude, as a cancerous growth, may spread to others and thus inflict spiritual damage to more than ourselves. We must strive to counter such imperfect inclinations by exercising love and forbearance. Do not be touchy and sensitive.

They, like David, testified by their life’s course: “I have been young, and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” (Ps. 37:25) Jesus himself had faith based on understanding that when he went out in God’s service his Father would see that he had enough to cat, that he obtained the needed sleep and had sufficient clothing.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are those who enthusiastically tackle the seemingly big tasks, especially if it brings them into the limelight, but how about smaller, insignificant tasks, perhaps menial ones, not seen by others?

(Acts 15:14) Now it is the turn of you his witnesses to demonstrate what the true knowledge of God will do for a people, an organization on a world-wide scale. One of the ways to do this is by acting as servant must prove his own dependability. The Creator himself supplies the pattern for all his creatures to follow. Note how carefully and with what thoroughness he has provided for all. Observe too all the careful preparation for the new world’s rule. The Lord Jesus is a perfect example of one caring tor the smallest details. Any service we are called upon to do by his “faithful and discreet slave” is important. Do it as to him.

Surely there is nothing of higher value in this transitory world. It is not common or ordinary.

(Matt. 13:7,22) Do not most persons find some time for less essential things, such as secular work? shopping for food? reading the newsearth. Today there are many among Jehovah’s witnesses who, as the world views things, have unusual natural abilities or talents. But do they choose temporal things, the loss of God’s treasured work and blessings? Certainly not. Rather they use all their natural abilities for the advancement of his work. We should consider our natural abilities as gifts from Jehovah and cultivate them in his service. Whatever abilities we have, therefore, whether many or few, should be applied to his work and to help us stick to it.

Every law and statute that is in harmony with righteousness the true Christians will obey in an exemplary fashion. But any law and demand made in conflict with the superior law and ing times set aside specifically for preaching, but throughout the day’s activities occasions will arise to present or defend the truth. Peter gave the above counsel concerning such. Is not this constant readiness the only way to be sure not to let opportunities slip by, to be certain that every moment is put to profitable use? Great joy is frequently derived from speaking about the truth to a person you might have been prone to let go without including it in your conversation. “Happjr are they who hold to what is right, who do their duty at all times </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">—P</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">s. 106: 3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mo.

It is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth is bound to speak. Having been favored to receive the Kingdom message into right and good hearts, we must “always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public decla-ratiou to his name”.

How much better it would be for a man to make his wealth work to the benefit of others while it has some value than to hold it until it gathers moths and rust and becomes useless! It is really a sound investment to make your money work on behalf of the poor and by so doing store up treasures in heaven. Christ Jesus preached the Word, and you can make your riches help you preach the Word. His admonition to us was to go forth and preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness.

At all times Jehovah protects those devoted to him from wild and beastly enemies, while at the same time he provides them fertile pasturelands of spiritual food and leads them along the life-sustaining streams of refreshing waters that constantly flow from his Word of truth. He has appointed servants to feed, aid and comfort his sheep in these modern times. They must not neglect their duties. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall we hold a grudge and be unyielding in our attitude and wait for the offender to come beaten and penitent at our feet?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The doing of God’s commandments through Christ proves we love Jehovah our Father. To love him aright, it takes understanding. (Mark 12 : 32, 33) Understanding him gives us an evaluation of all that the one Supreme God Jehovah is and all that he means to us for our eternal welfare; and it makes us love him more.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience to the great Lifegiver spells eternal life for us in the new world, and the old world’s persecution of us will continue failing to halt the Kingdom's increase. We will keep our integrity to God in vindication of his universal sovereignty and his right to rule his creation. In theocratic obedience and faithfulness we possible disturbance. If he will not hear us, then we can lay the matter before representative members of the congregation so that they, quietly and in a spirit of gentleness, may remonstrate with the offender. (Matt. 18:15-17) We must not let slip from our mind the general good and welfare of the congregation. Our efforts at settlement of auy dispute should be put forth having first in mind the company’s peace and unity, so that God’s service of praise is not interfered with. Thus we hold onto our brothers, and willingly help others with their load. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of understanding is therefore the only way that will bring any of Christ’s anointed followers into the Kingdom or any of his “other sheep” of good will into endless life on a paradise earth in the new world, now so near. In the matter of getting understanding, Jesus Christ is our highest example, for no other son of God is more understanding than he is. For this reason our heavenly Father loves him most tenderly. In teaching him understanding his Father said: “Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. Get wisdom, get understanding.”—Prov. 4: 3-5. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">will march on toward the new world, rejoicing in all further expansion of his kingdom, for there will be no end to its increase even this side of Armageddon. If we keep on sowing his Kingdom message, we shall reap returns for eternity, for God will give his promised increase. Having sown to the interests of Jehovah’s Theocracy by Christ we will reap the increase of thousands of other Kingdom adherents, the “other sheep” whom the Right Shepherd will yet gather into the “one fold” of everlasting security.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The visible theocratic organization that now grows and prospers has been cleansed, purged of ensnaring practices as creature worship. The increase in the number of active witnesses is credited to Jehovah God; it comes not by human might or power, but by his spirit.

Such worldly elements are opposing the divine purpose and are vessels of divine wrath fitted for destruction at Armageddon.

Into his organizational arrangement they come, and the gates are open to receive them, shut neither day nor night. And why the ever-increasing tempo of ingathering now? Is it due to any brilliant human minds in the visible organization? or to efficient methods or procedures practiced?

The assurance that they will not be driven over the precipice to which that broad road leads, into the abyss of death at Armageddon, causes them to rejoice.

What separateness from all elements of this world, and what dedication to Jehovah God, could be more complete than these have expressed and maintained? Maintaining this attitude, the witnesses associated with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have proved to be clean vessels, fit for the Master’s use.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The “faithful and discreet slave” class have been absolutely dependable. No opportunities have been allowed to slip by that could be used to further the Kingdom interests. Complete performance has been rendered. Not only have they cared for these “belongings”, but have sought to advance them always.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Peter looked forward to the new world, and he tried to live worthy of entering it. And especially for the benefit of us living at this world climax he wrote telling us how he tried to live and how we ought to live. After the “sheep”, scatter the flock, and even rob and devour widow’s houses to satisfy their lustful and greedy appetites. Make no mistake: if any servant with Jehovah’s fold would prey upon his brethren or in any wise follow such a course of iniquity as seeking dishonest gain, the Right Shepherd's holy angels would move so swiftly in casting the worthless wretch out that his teeth would start to gnash and chatter. If he proved unrepentant, his end would be the same as that of the false shepherds: everlasting destruction.

There is much to be accomplished, and by Jehovah’s goodness the great work will be done. But how about all the individuals making up the anointed remnant and now the thousands of “other sheep” of good will? Does the King express his pleasure and confidence in these individuals, or does he reckon and deal only with groups? Unquestionably he judges and approves or disapproves individuals. Of course, such persons do not operate independently of the “faithful and discreet slave” class. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">describing the world-wide flood of Noah’s time and then the thieflike arrival of Jehovah’s destructive day upon the Devil’s heavens and earth, he wrote the above. We may not know now the day or the hour when the battle of Armageddon will break out and the wicked heavens and earth of the Devil’s world will be dissolved to make way for the new heavens and earth of the precious new world. We do not need to know, but every day we can live in the consciousness that it is near. We can live lives harmonizing with our hope.

Jesus referred to this dark time as proof that we had reached the time of the end of this world, and that conditions would not grow better, but worse. But while those that are in darkness would be busy trying to improve conditions in this old world the servants of Jehovah would be busy preaching the good news of the Kingdom as the only hope for peace and security for the human race on earth.

He has rid the organization of his people of all untheocratic features and individuals. He has therefore lifted his curse from us.

But he became so carried away with his own importance and disturbed by Israel’s repeated transgressions that he failed to honor Jehovah proptheir change by death and resurrection and be gathered into the invisible new heavens, but the “other sheep” will carry on as the new earth with visible “princes”. That righteous “new earth” will grow from this small nucleus until it includes all those resurrected from death who obey the Kingdom. When the Kingdom will have accomplished God’s purpose toward men by the thousand years’ end, then that arrangement will end.

Their heart stores up treasures of good things, because it fixes its affections upon such. When God’s ministers come along with the seed of his Word, they let God by his Word and spirit write his law upon the tablets of the heart, so that from then on they do God’s will from the heart, by the power of his spirit. They guard their hearts with all vigilance, for out of it flow the wellsprings of life.

The greatest enemy of understanding is self in any form, self-importance, self-pity, or self-indulgence. Self always beclouds the issue and obscures the vision. Therefore, if we would retain understanding, we must continually keep self in subjection and our eye focused on Jehovah’s glory. We must study his Word and meditate upon the examples he sets forth in the Scriptures for our guidance and follow them closely. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When Paul was traveling from place to place, he did not want to make himself a burden to the brethren, so at times he would stop and make tents.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Because we have not cowardly drooped our hands since he turned us from a captive state in 1919, he has vindicated this promise to us in a wondrous way. For the shame we once bore, he has made Jehovah’s witnesses a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth. Not among the hardened worldlings who ridi-earthly needs, but at the same time he could not neglect his preaching duties. Luke tells us, at Acts 18: 3,4, that Paul never failed to go to the synagogue on the sabbath to preach God’s Word to the Jews and he also mingled with the Greeks that they too might hear. Eating and drinking and being clothed are not the all-essential things in this life. They are necessary, yes, but the big thing is storing up treasures for oneself in heaven.

Their congregations are neighbors living within their reach, to whom they preach. Thus true love is expressed, not only to God in obedience to his command to preach, but also to their neighbors. Doing this, these ministers guarantee salvation for themselves and also for those who respond to the Kingdom message. Truly Jehovah’s new world ministers, whether pioneers or otherwise, are a special possession to him. He will never forsake them.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Let earthly society of Satan’s dominion go on writhing in anguish for stubbornly refusing divine rule.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have no cause to be impatient. It is God who sets the time for all things, and being unduly concerned about when Armageddon will come does not hasten it. Jehovah is more fully aware of men’s wickedness than we are. It is Uis name primarily that they are maligning, it is His creation that they have been corrupting for centuries. If he is patient enough to allow men a little more time to heed and turn from their time-wasting, life-wasting</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark288"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gideon and his three hundred started the battle under Jehovah’s direction. By his grace they finished it. So it is now the anointed remnant that plays the principal role in the visible Christian warfare against Satan’s agents, being used to start it and finish it so far as it relates to these “last days”. Back there Ephra-imites captured and slew the Midianite princes Oreb and world and has now established the theocratic government for it in the mighty hands of Christ Jesus. Shortly the removal of the Devil’s old world will follow as a certain consequence at Armageddon’s war of vindication, and the new earth will be established on the foundations of everlasting righteousness. We delight now to obey the prophetic command for this glorious time in the above psalm. This prophetic command determines for us our message and states our commission of service. So our commission and our message remain unchangeable. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">course, surely we should have patience to give them the opportunity, knowing God’s will is “that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”. (1 Tim. 2:4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> No servants of God, even those who become impatient, feel that their work of gospel-preaching is wasted. They see and experience evidence of God’s approval on their actions. His assurance they have that they have been doing well. God rewards every man according to his works and eternal life is granted those who patiently continue doing good. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeeb, but Gideon took and destroyed the two kings of Midian. It is necessary for “other sheep” now to keep such things in mind, that they may always appreciate their relationship to the remnant, to the organization, to the Greater Gideon Christ Jesus and to Jehovah God. The fact that by weight of numbers they now perform the bulk of the witness work should only make them humble in their precious privilege. Never should it cause them to exalt themselves against the remnant under whose immediate direction they work. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The entire body of Christ is to be associated with Jesus in the heavenly kingdom in the world to come. This Kingdom body with Jesus Christ as King of kings will be Jehovah’s capital organization oyer the universe.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We can no longer be reproached as a man-made organization, following a human leader. Now we are theocratically assembled and organized and have a Rightful Ruler over us, the King of eternity. The enemy will never again be able to break up our worldwide unity.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Each day makes the appointed time shorter. Each day presents opportunities to proclaim God’s name and purpose that will never be repeated. And each day faithful ministers are buying up their opportunities, with the result that a growing throng is halting from the headlong plunge that the nations are taking toward destruction. As they halt and hear and learn they joyfully devote their lives to Jehovah’s service and share in the most were next to Jesus Christ the Head. Hence they formed part of the superior authorities to which every Christian soul was to be subject. (Rev. 21:14; Rom. 13:1) Paul was one of the governing body of the first century and speaks in places of his authority. According to the theocratic arrangement today there must be a governing body for the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the earth. These are associated with the Watch Tower Society. But the twentieth-century governing body are no part of the superior authorities as the apostles were, but arc subject.

By turning to us his one “pure language”, and by his setting our hands to work in his united service, and by assembling us together in conventions and other gatherings, the God of peace and unity has welded us together more tightly. Through the common worship and faith given us out of his One Book, the Bible, and through his one theocratic organization, he has cemented us together in the unity of a new world people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">profitable activity ever presented to man.

In the thousands of years ahead in which you may enjoy the blessings Jehovah has in store for those who serve him, you will never regret you were among those who did not act thoughtlessly but, like sensible men, made the most of your opportunities in these wicked times.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the proclamation God’s praisers must make, let all men note that the only government which he promised to set up and which he has set up is a kingdom. It is a kingdom in which Jehovah God is the absolute Ruler, and it is not a democracy. So it is a Theocracy, and not a people’s rule.

But they are too concerned about tomorrow and its needs and so do not uproot such thorny things by fully trusting Jehovah according to his promises. Then, too, they are deeply heirs worship the Supreme Ruler as God. This is proper, because Jehovah is indeed the living and true God and all mankind owe to him their existence and all life’s blessings, and notably their redemption from sin, condemnation and death by the sacrifice of his Son. Jehovah our God is the Almighty, and happy it is for mankind that such an allpowerful one as he has taken the reins of government of the earth.

If they have time, they must spend it in the “pleasures of this life”. For relief from anxiety and boredom they feel they must turn to such pleasures. If we are infested with those sticky, thorny growths, we need to burn them off so as to allow the seed of God’s Word in us to grow, leading to fruit bearing.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah, the great Builder of the universe and the Creator of life, is worthy of praise. For his own pleasure he willingly undertook the burden of bringing into existence a great mass of orderly creation, visible and invisible.

No, they are prompted by no such selfish motives, but count it a greater blessing to give out the truth to others than it was to receive perish. The rapidly approaching battle of Armageddon makes the matter of praising God increasingly urgent for survival. At this critical stage of world history it is more than a question of what is expedient for us. We cannot avoid the issue, nor will the shortness of the time allow for us to ponder our steps indefinitely. Only positive action now toward praising Jehovah will guarantee continued existence, for God is now bringing everything into final judgment.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">No, God, with whom a thousand years is as one day, is not slow in allowing these few intervening years to be used for the profitable purpose of gospel-preaching. With him it is as but a few moments; and the remaining days can go by rapidly for you too. You can ‘keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah’ by having a share in the purpose for which these days have been set aside. (Matt. 24:14) If the remaining days are occupied in profitable service they will not drag for you ; they will fly by as if on wings. Do not allow this world’s false sense of security to lull you to sleep and think that God’s patience will continue forever. This generation is “too busy” to stop using its remaining time in the manner in which it is accustomed.

If we love life and want divine approval, we, of course, want to do right and escape God’s wrath. Fear of wrath is not (Matt. 9 : 35, 36) He may have been tired and weary from his extensive travels throughout all the cities and villages, and from his exhaustive work of teaching, preaching and healing the sick and diseased, yet he did not pass up this multitude of sheep and leave them without a shepherd until sometime later. When he saw they were sheep who were going astray, he “started to teach them many things”, pointing out to them the right way that leads to eternal life. (Mark 6: 34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> He surrendered his human soul that they might live. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">after dominate all the earth without any rival powers.

Subjecting ourselves to the “superior authorities” because they are God’s arrangement is right. So, not just to avoid God’s wrath, but rather for the sake of our good conscience, we will keep subject to them. This means life.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall lie increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Dan. 12:</span><span class="font4"> 4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The people’s running to and fro through Christendom fails to locate the words of Jehovah for the relief of the spiritual famine. Then what running to and fro is it that results in the promised increase of knowledge? It is the running to and fro in God’s written Word, that is to say, the scrutinizing and examining of the Bible for our direct instruction. If the clergy reject the Bible in favor of worldly philosophy and traditions of men contrary to can be found. After they find one of his sheep, they do as the Master told his disciple: “Feed my little sheep.” Repeated visits are made on these, and home Bible studies are conducted with them, that they may learn the good purposes of Jehovah and take their stand on his side, then joining in the gathering work. “Let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ ” (Rev. 22:17, iW) The work is great and the workers are few. All who love Jehovah God and their fellow man will join in this ingathering work of Jehovah before it is too late. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">midst. He, the Supreme Ruler of the universe, is our King! The kingdom of God, prayed for so many centuries, has at last been established. We belong to Jehovah God by individually dedicating ourselves to him. His Son the Right Shepherd surrendered his human soul for us that he might purchase us; and we have acknowledged his rightful ownership of us. God has therefore every right to be our King and to establish himself as our King. His enthroned Son Jesus Christ we will have as our Leader rather than any totalitarian dictator. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">10/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God's Word, then the people who want life must themselves run to and fro through its pages if they are ever going to get the life-giving increase of knowledge. So let the people act independently of the religious leaders who have failed them. Let them exercise faith and run to and fro through God’s now unsealed and opened Book. His spirit that searches the “deep things of God” has been poured out. The greatest service we can render humanity is to impart the knowledge of God and encourage them to run to and fro through his Book in personal Bible study. IF </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out from there to teach.—Matt. 11:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The instructions on doing the work must have sounded strange to the disciples, such being so entirely contrary to human reasoning that one might think they would not understand ; but they were willing. (10:1-16) But this is the procedure Jesus himself followed, and it is the course of action he advocated for his followers to take. He knew that any earthly accumulations other than what was absolutely</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The obligations of Jehovah’s witnesses, requiring them to live up to the name of Jehovah, arc carried out by both old and young alike. In every part of the earth are to be found young and old preaching and teaching the glad tidings of God’s kingdom. True to the admonition of Ecclesiastes 12: 1, the young ministers of Jehovah God remember their Creator in the days of their youth. To escape the destruction which is the destiny of the unfaithful religionists at Armageddon,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Your sons shall step into your fathers’ place, and rise to be princes</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> [sartm] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">over all the land.—Ps. 55:16, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To be made princes, in the Hebrew sense of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bar, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in the New World society, in the “new earth”, offers a variety of opportunities of service with responsibilities of varying degrees; and there will be many such privileges. In the new earth they will not be addressed with the title “prince” before their name. No; we will be living then under a </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christian</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> government. Those “other necessary for them to get along with would simply De extra burdens upon them and would interfere with the commission they had received from Jehovah. All unnecessary weights that would interfere with accomplishing their very important work must be given up. These things would just be something to worry about, to divide their attention. Above everything else Jesus wanted their minds to be free and entirely devoted to their commission from God in order to insure its success. Jesus had understanding and helped the disciples understand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">they offer acceptable sacrifice of praise now. They do not wait until they are old and decrepit to praise Jehovah by preaching and teaching. They serve while they have vigor. They put forth all their energies in their youth, laying up a great treasure of right works. Preaching work is not reserved to the few. It is open to all, young and old, from every nationality and walk of life, who are willing to enter into relationship with God and who want to volunteer to live up to his name by declaring his work, kingdom and name in this time of the end. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sheep” who have been given positions of responsibility in the visible theocratic organization of today, even if it be over a group of ten who meet for Bible study and united service in the neighborhood, should look well to how they discharge their responsibilities now. Remember the rule stated by Jesus: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.” (Luke 16:10, A’lf) Only if you prove yourself faithful in what is committed to you now in this passing old world will you have any likelihood of being made prince then. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread thereof. Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify : and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.—Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8:12, IS, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Just try to imagine the fear you might have toward these evil worldly powers. Go to the limit in your imagining, and then realize with all the force possible that the fear of Jehovah must be far greater than all that. Sometimes there is an inclination to water down this expression </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fear</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and say it means just “reverence” of Je-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone.—Matt. 18:15,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> A'IV'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A great amount of time, mental concern and productive effort can be saved when the above Scriptural rule is followed. Usually difficulties can be settled between the two concerned if each is willing to put his own feelings second and love his brother as himself. Not even one night of anxiety should be spent while the wrong, either real or imagined, grows in the mind. “Let not the sun set with you in a provoked state.” (Eph. 4:26,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday, December 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 6: 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus was a busy man; he was looking after Kingdom interests. He was moving throughout the whole countryside, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. His disciples followed him and were instructed by him. He could not be confined to some particular locality to take care of possessions, nor could his disciples, not if they were to preach the gospel throughout Israel. Jesus had not even a place to lay his hovah. True, reverence must be included in our fear of him, but fear also means dread, awe. Does not ordinary sense convey to us that Jehovah the Lifegiver can just as easily take away our life as he can give it? (Job 1: 21) Knowledge of the great Creator is so essential, and those knowing him best trust him most and fear is with all. No one is exempt from fearing Jehovah, not even the beloved Son of God. Why, even he was “favorably heard for his godly fear”, his reverent fear of his heavenly Father. —Deb. 5:7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IF.

Rising in the morning, he joyfully goes into the service of his God instead of lingering with a heavy heart. A servant of God, busy about his master’s business, does not let himself become involved in controversies of others. Before he can extricate himself from the situation he will have spent much more time there than he intended and the evidence will clearly show that it was not time profitably spent.—Prov. 26: 17. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">head, much less a house to call home. Jehovah provided for Jesus, the second Adam, just as He did for the first Adam. The Son of God had the necessary food, clothing and a place of shelter. He was a welcome guest in the homes of those who loved truth and righteousness. Jesus knew a laborer was worthy of his hire; for He worked in the interests of God’s kingdom. The necessary things of life were assured; so why should he try to accumulate great wealth? He had food and raiment. With these he was content </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to render to each one as his work is.—Rev.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 22</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It has always been true that Christians are required to work, for that is according to God’s principles. The work we have been given is a great blessing. It keeps us away from the dangerous things of the old world, so it acts as a protector. The work we have to do now is teaching and preaching. All of the time and strength we can possibly muster should go into the work. We have entered into it with determination to see it through to the finish. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Tuesday, December 25 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You should go on walking worthily of God who is calling you to his kingdom and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Thess. 2:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Being a God of purpose, Jehovah arranged to have a separate and distinct people for his name in this time of the end. They must not be his people in name only; they must live up to the name. Jehovah’s witnesses will live up to the name notwithstanding all that their enemies can do in an effort to stop them and throw them from the path of righteousness that leads to life cver-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, December 26 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.—Isa. 26: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Continued study and use of Bible truth brings great peace of mind. Those lacking this bulwark find their minds besieged with all manner of cares and worries. Consider what a tremendous amount of time is wasted daily through worry alone! Worry accomplishes nothing. Jesus asked : “Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?” name of Jehovah is involved and so is our eternal salvation. We want to win and we can win by doing good works. Now is the time. Because the final settling of the great issue is to come in this generation, our salvation is much nearer thau when Christians first started to serve God, even much closer than when we first started to do God’s work. We must not take chances by looking back to the old world for anything. We cannot risk even the slightest slowing down. We must stick to our work, faithfully looking to the time when Jehovah fulfills his statement above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">lasting. They must, to live up to the name, always be circumspect and walk in a way they know to be pleasing to Jehovah God. They pray that they may not be abandoned when tempted by the enemy, Satan the Devil, and be left without protection from his assaults. They know they must keep their minds set on things above, not only when in the missionary field, but also at every other hour of the day. The business of living up to the name is a twenty-four-hours-a-day job. It requires all of one’s time and attention. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5/15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matt. 6:27, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> One cannot lengthen the remaining time for him by worrying, neither can he profitably use that which is already allotted. And how can time-consuming worry be effectively banished? By comfort from God. Paul contended that God had comforted him that he might in turn comfort others. Doing so, he followed his Exemplar, Christ Jesus, whose commission was, in part, “to comfort all that mourn.” (Isa. 61:2) Sharing comfort, preaching gospel truths, will free distraught minds for profitable use. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun io rule as king. —Rev. 19: 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The wrathful nations, though resorting to totalitarian methods, are unable to drown out Jehovah’s praise. We can hear the voice of a great crowd sounding like many waters and like heavy thunders. Yes, we can hear them saying: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.&quot; Since the sound of their voices is so mighty that it is likened to the sound of many waters and to thunder peals, terrestrial and celestial sounds, it suggests that an earthly class and a heavenly class are producing the mighty proclamation. The facts agree with this. The remnant of spiritual Israelites, in line for the heavenly kingdom, have been openly praising Jah or Jehovah since 1919, when they were released from Babylon’s power. They have since been joined by thousands whose hope is for an earthly destiny. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Luke 8: 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yielding a hundredfold is outstanding. But it does not denote perfection of service in the case of any of us imperfect ministers. It denotes our trying to live up fully to the opportunities that present themselves or that we can clear the way for. We are not to make comparisons among ourselves, cither to blow ourselves up with pride or to make excuses for our underproduction. Such</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday, December 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But if you are doing evil, be in fear: for it is not without purpose that it</span><span class="font4"> [tfte </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">authority] bears the sword; for it is God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath upon the one practicing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">evil.—Rom. 13:</span><span class="font4"> 4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ is on the throne and ruling in the midst of his foes. He is God’s avenger and the vindicator of his universal sovereignty. The sword which the authority bears symbolizes God-given power to execute judgment and cut off those who range themselves against God. So as Christ rides to a course is not wise for us. But we can note and rejoice in the increase which God gives in varying amounts in this one’s case and in that one’s, and we can study the reasons for it to our own profiting. We all have room for growth in productivity. None can ever equal the great Sower himself in bearing fruit to God. The Christian who sows the Word sparingly will reap sparingly. But those who zealously expend themselves will have God make them abound with the righteousness of spreading his life-giving Word.—2 Cor. 9 : 6-12. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">execute God's vengeance at Armageddon, “out of his mouth there protrudes a sharp long sword, that he may smite the nations with it.” (Rev. 19: 15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> At Armageddon he will not recognize the political powers of this world as the “superior authorities” with absolute control over every soul. No, but he will destroy them, treat them as his footstool, beneath his feet, and will tread them to destruction. No more will there be a Caesar to whom anything must be paid. All things will be God’s and be paid to him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

Remember that he will save his theocratic organization whom he here addresses, and so let our desire for safety and deliverance spur us to adhere tightly to the organization.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Have I not told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Isa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The privilege of preaching the Kingdom message has been joyously caught up by Jehovah’s witnesses. Since 1918 they have been running to and fro in the Scriptures and their knowledge has increased. Now, as the “wise” among the people, they instruct many by a great campaign of education of the people in God’s purposes. (Dan. 11:33; 12:4) Such facts prove they, exclusively, are living up to the name. Je-its godly submission and obedience to him in the midst of an enemy world. And in loving his organized people he finds rest. He is not excited, disturbed, irritable, and suspicious, for joyfully he observes the unmistakable proofs of our love for him. He has restored his organized people to his love and has renewed her in his love. So, seeing that he rejoices thus over his organization, and since he rests in his love for it, let us individually give him no cause for uneasiness about us, but let us keep ourselves in God’s love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W10/1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hovah now has anointed witnesses who are true, legitimate sons of God, begotten by his spirit, and spiritual brothers of the anointed King Christ Jesus. Associated with them and also bearing the name, are a “great crowd” of “other sheep” who are to become earthly children of the King. Together they bear the name Jehovah’s witnesses. By testifying concerning the truth of God's purposes, they live up to the name. By doing so they have distinguished themselves from the false impersonators, the religious clergy and their followers.—Rev. 7:9; John 10: 16.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>REMAINING FEARLESS TO THE ACCOMPLISHED END</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today fear and anxiety grip nearly all of earth’s inhabitants, as they look ahead to what is coming upon mankind. Foretold in Bible prophecy, the approach of the accomplished end of this present old world is marked with mounting troubles and woes, of kinds and intensity without parallel in human history. For these very days of uncertainty and insecurity Almighty God has decreed that a comforting, confidence-inspiring message be taken to all willing hearers. Support and strength can come only from the true Source: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1, 2</a>) To find this refuge, and to learn how to gain this strength, we must study God’s Word, both individually and with others, and then share in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. Have you prepared to participate in this work during September, by fearlessly making known this good news in your neighborhood, offering the book <em>“Let God Be True” </em>and a 32-page booklet on a contribution of 35 cents? Report your activity as you help others in remaining fearless to the accomplished end.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><em>● </em>In the famous seaport of Valparaíso one of the missionaries began a study in <em>“Let God Be True” </em>with a Catholic family. Like all Catholics they had their own statue of the Virgin, a large expensive one in this case. Following the study of the chapter, “Use of Images in Worship,” they realized the pagan nature of such worship, but they did not wish to lose the money invested by destroying the image so an advertisement was inserted in the daily paper. Many came to investigate but in each case they asked, “Why do you wish to sell it?” To all they explained the truth they had learned from their Bible study as to the uselessness of such an image. This resulted in no buyers but many hours of witnessing. It gave so many opportunities to witness that they became loathe to sell it.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Hearing that there was to be a great assembly of the people from different places at the kraal [native community] of one of the Paramount chiefs and that he was to be present also, I arranged with some brothers to witness to the people gathered there. While witnessing an official whom I knew arranged for me to be among the speakers that were to address the assembly the following Sunday. Sunday we came and gathered outside the kraal’s yard. There was an attendance of more than 600 people. We were surprised to see representatives of various creeds and denominations present. The first to deliver some talks were the Abafundisi [local religious cult]. They dealt with the resurrection of Christ, as it was Easter Sunday with them. I was then called upon. I stood up and gave my talk, “Peace on Earth, When?” First of all I noticed that they were surprised that I had chosen this topic instead of one having to do with Easter. Afterward they all attentively listened and some of them nodded their heads. When I looked at the Paramount chief I noticed that he was smiling—it was apparent that he is a man who likes Bible facts. It seemed that the time would not allow me to finish my talk. While I was still talking, the chief indicated that I should be given more time. After I concluded two others spoke. After that the chief stood up and summarized the talks. First he thanked me for coming and for telling his people the truth. He then told the audience that I was the only one who was able to convince those who, like himself, love the Bible truth. He then discounted what the Abafundisi told the people by stating that the Bible showed that these were misleading the people. He also gave us an invitation to speak at a great gathering that was to be held at his royal kraal.</p>

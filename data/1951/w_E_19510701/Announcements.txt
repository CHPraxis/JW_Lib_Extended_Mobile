“LIFE-GIVING KNOWLEDGE” TESTIMONY PERIOD
The greatest service any man or woman could possibly render to humanity today is to impart to them the knowledge of God and encourage them to run to and fro through His Book in personal Bible study. Knowledge of this kind, if taken in and acted upon, will result in its bringing life to its possessor. Appropriate now when there is so much falsely called “knowledge”, Jehovah’s servants on earth have set aside the month of August as the “Life-giving Knowledge” Testimony Period. The book “Let God Be True” and the latest self-covered booklet will be offered to all kinds of men world-wide, on a contribution of 35c, in order to give them the opportunity to gain the most important knowledge in the whole world. Align yourself with this life-giving work, turn in a report of what you do in that month, and be one of this great crowd in spreading knowledge that gives life to those that want it and are willing to work for it.
NEW WORLD TRANSLATION
To every sincere seeker for truth this Bible translation will be of genuine value. It contains an outstanding rendition of the sacred Greek Scriptures, commonly called “The New Testament”. It uses up-to-date English but sticks scrupulously to the wording and thought content of the Greek original. A simple yet vivid and consistently accurate translation, it wholly ignores man-made traditions and false religious creeds and dogmas. It faithfully adheres to the basic text found in most recently discovered copies of ancient and reliable original manuscripts. Historical and Scriptural explanations of perplexing points and questions are found in both its text and appendix pages. Obtain a copy for a contribution of $1.50.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE great Master Worker of all is Jehovah God, and all his works are perfect. Christ Jesus is also a worker extraordinary, for no other man ever performed works as great as he. “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.” “We must work the works of him that sent me,” Jesus said. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:17-43:5:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 5:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:4-43:9:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:4</a>, NW) From village to village he hastened, preaching and teaching in the synagogues and in the homes of the people. On the mountain sides, at the seashores, by the roadsides, and in the market places, Jesus taught the people out of the divine Textbook of wisdom, God’s Word the Bible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What a wonderful example Jesus gave in the pure worship! Recommending that others follow him, Jesus trained and instructed his disciples and sent them out to do the same worth-while work. And this is what Paul meant when he urged Timothy, “Continue in the things you learned.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14</a>, NW.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Remember Lot’s wife! Do not be a quitter and turn back to the filth of modern Sodom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:32-42:17:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 17:32</a>) Look ahead to the sublime Kingdom and its divine blessings! Do not let worldly attractions or desires turn you aside. Your time and energy are limited. Expend them in God’s service.</p>

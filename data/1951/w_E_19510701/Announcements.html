<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“LIFE-GIVING KNOWLEDGE” TESTIMONY PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The greatest service any man or woman could possibly render to humanity today is to impart to them the knowledge of God and encourage them to run to and fro through His Book in personal Bible study. Knowledge of this kind, if taken in and acted upon, will result in its bringing life to its possessor. Appropriate now when there is so much falsely called “knowledge”, Jehovah’s servants on earth have set aside the month of August as the “Life-giving Knowledge” Testimony Period. The book <em>“Let God Be True” </em>and the latest self-covered booklet will be offered to all kinds of men world-wide, on a contribution of 35c, in order to give them the opportunity to gain the most important knowledge in the whole world. Align yourself with this life-giving work, turn in a report of what you do in that month, and be one of this great crowd in spreading knowledge that gives life to those that want it and are willing to work for it.</p>

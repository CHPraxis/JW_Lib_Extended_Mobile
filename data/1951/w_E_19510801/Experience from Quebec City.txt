Experience from Quebec City
During his sickness, Brother Bilodeau was visited almost like the faithful Job. His brothers, sisters, priests, Franciscan Fathers, Jesuits, nuns and one of his sons were afraid for him. All of them in general tried to bring him back into the Devil’s organization. Regularly we visited him and very often he said: “Something makes me tired.” He was too weak to say more. Under the bed we found a large idol tied there. We showed it to him and destroyed it, after which he said, “I am happy.” Many times we had to do that after finding idols under his bed. Brother Bilodeau kept integrity till death.
His relatives said that the funeral was good, much better than any other religion, and that they were surprised to hear what the Bible said concerning the dead. One of them, his son from Lauzon, said that our sincerity and devotion for his father opened his eyes and that, “I will be very glad to continue to open my eyes by studying the Holy Bible with the great help of Jehovah’s witnesses who will visit us in my house.”

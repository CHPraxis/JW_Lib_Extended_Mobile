<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>REMAINING FEARLESS TO THE ACCOMPLISHED END</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today fear and anxiety grip nearly all of earth’s inhabitants as they look ahead to what is coming upon mankind. Foretold in Bible prophecy, the approach of the accomplished end of this present old world is marked with mounting troubles and woes, of kinds and intensity without parallel in human history. For these very days of uncertainty and insecurity Almighty God has decreed that a comforting, confidence-inspiring message be taken to all willing hearers. Support and strength can come only from the true Source: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1, 2</a>) To find this refuge, and to learn how to gain this strength, we must study God’s Word, both individually and with others, and then share in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. Have you prepared to participate in this work during September, by fearlessly making known this good news in your neighborhood, offering the book <em>“Let God Be True” </em>and a 32-page booklet on a contribution of 35 cents? Report your activity as you help others in remaining fearless to the accomplished end.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“LET GOD BE TRUE”</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In this day when honesty among men, high and low, is sadly lacking, great satisfaction results from knowing that humanity has one sure and trustworthy source of truth. That source is the true and living God, Jehovah. Accurate knowledge of him and his revealed purposes anyone can now gain through study of his Word, the Bible. Helpful for such Bible study is the book <em>“Let God Be True”</em>. In its 320 pages, basic truths and sound doctrines are made plain and understandable. God’s truth is clearly set forth; lies and errors of men and their traditions are boldly identified and dispelled. With a complete index of subjects and scriptures, this book (available in 26 languages) is sent, postpaid, on a contribution of 35c.</p>

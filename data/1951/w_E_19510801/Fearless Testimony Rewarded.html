<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● I tried to obtain school buildings and other available places for our public meeting series, but after explaining the nature of our work I was turned down at each place. As a last resort I called on the local judge and requested permission to use the courtroom for our public lectures. After a lively discussion concerning the nature of our work the judge said: “Are you not connected with that sect whose members refuse to fight for their country and whose children refuse to salute the flag? And you have the nerve to come and ask for my courtroom to hold meetings to instruct the people in such things?” I frankly called his attention to the Lord’s message and the dividing of the people, read a few excerpts from the booklet <em>God and the State </em>concerning the stand that Jehovah’s witnesses have taken, and then mentioned that Jehovah’s witnesses are law-abiding citizens who have the greatest respect for the laws of the United States and the principles for which the flag stands. After a brief silence the judge exclaimed: “You seem to be earnest enough in your convictions, therefore I will not make a hasty decision regarding your request. Write a letter stating the reason for the use of the courtroom and I will take it up with the county authority.” The letter was written and sent. Result? Courtroom obtained; attendance, first meeting, 53; second meeting, 75.—C. J., Virginia.</p>

<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Atomic Dilemma</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font2">WO “shots” fired In Japan in the momentous month of August, 1945, were truly &quot;heard round the world”. The echoes from the atomic blasts that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never died away. The years since have seen repercussions from the initial blows of man’s mightiest weapon swirl m a pool of world hate and jealousy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the arrival of the<sup>j</sup> Korean affair pressure has increased both for and against use of the A-bomb by U. N. forces. Primary attention has centered around the moral question over which American and world church groups have presented a divided and indecisive front On December 5,1950, the International Council of Christian Churches sent to President Truman its authorization for use of the atomic bomb &quot;to defend human freedom if necessary”. They declared that use under such conditions would violate no moral principles. Going much farther, Edmund A. Walsh, S.J., vice-president of Georgetown University, declared that even an aggressive &quot;preventive war” spearheaded by an atomic attack on Russia would be justified if certainty existed that this nation were itself in imminent threat of such an attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In general, however, reactions have been considerably more modified. During the last week of November, 1950, a special commission of Protestant theologians and laymen meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, approved use of atomic weapons, but in reservation, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;If atomic weapons or other weapons of parallel destructiveness are used against us or our friends in Europe or Asia, we believe that it could be justifiable for our government to use them In retaliation with all possible restraint.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A fiat protest against use of the atomic bomb was issued the first of last December by a group of seventy-eight Protestant clergymen of western New York. They pleaded with “our people, our government officials and the United Nations not to permit use of the weapon lest we lose all claim to God's mercy by permitting the destruction of the innocent as well as the guilty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Representing 160,000,000 church followers of forty-four lands, the policy-forming committee of the World Council of Churches, though approving U. N. action tn Korea, resolved that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Such methods of modem warfare as the use of atomic and bacteriological weapons and obliteration bombing involve employment of force and destruction of life on so terrible a scale as to imperil the very basis on which law and civilization can exist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another expression was made by Henry Knok Sherrill, head of the young National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S. A. In a seeming attempt to appraise both sides of the moral question, this nominal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">head of thirty-one million Protestants said use of the bomb was not necessarily “immoral” He continued, “I don’t see how you can say knives are all right and the A-bomb all wrong?* Asserting that it is not the business of the church to promote war, and ‘Tm not sure it’s right for the church to bless war” this prominent clergyman thus struck squarely on one of the clergy’s most vulnerable positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no use denying the countless conflicting political regimes and wars the clergy of Christendom have blessed. While the motive behind their general plea now against the atom bomb may be quite humanitarian, it would seem the gentlemen of the cloth could go much farther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many sense this. Following the use of the first A-bombs, Denis de Rougemont, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Last Trump,</span><span class="font2"> referred to “pastors, bishops, popes, rabbis and priests” who voiced initial protests. “In general they held the view,” he states, “that it is criminal not so much to kill as to kill </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">en masse </span><span class="font2">and by new methods?’ He asks ironically what should have been done, “abide by the good old methods tacitly approved by the clergy of all countries such as bayonet thrusts in the abdomen and flame throwers which roast a man alive in three seconds”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is undeniable logic here. A man killed by a plane, tank, flame-thrower, grenade, land mine, bayonet or plain gun is just as dead as one obliterated by an atomic blast. Certainly, the latter occasion will take many more lives with it, but a hundred thousand lives are just individual cases multiplied one hundred thousand times and collected into one place. Admitted, bombings of cities, for which atomic bombs are specifically designed, mean an excessive loss in civilian life. But a number of civilians were being bombed under the old “blockbuster” system too. Will an A-bomb deprive the user of any more 'Claim to God’s mercy* than a blockbuster? How does a flame-thrower rate as a peril to the *130518 on which law and civilization can exist”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a politician betrays the trust of the people he serves, it is bad. When a religious minister does so, it is just as bad and, on top of that, it drags </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">into disrepute </span><span class="font2">the lofty name of Almighty God, whom such men profess to represent. The name and purposes Christendom has taken upon herself she has had sixteen </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">centuries </span><span class="font2">to live up to. Has she done so? Rather than her claims, let her political conspiracies, wars, many of which she was at the very bottom of, and the condition of spiritual want by her subjects give answer. How many times has she met in solemn religious assembly in search of a ‘better world’? How often has the name of God been on her lips? How little in her heart? How often have her many words touched on the real afflictions of the people, wars for example, and how to relieve them? These questions answer themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hence, it brings no satisfaction to read of the fifty-odd clergymen who met in the Washington Cathedral, Washington, D.C., on “Ash Wednesday”, 1950, to discuss “God, Man and the Hydrogen Bomb”. Their opening words convicted them; “Almighty God . . . We stand before thee in this time of peril and perplexity, our hearts failing us for fear, our minds groping in darkness ...” In obvious accord with their past confusion, they had nothing of comfort to offer, no answer to their dilemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the hands of such guides, Christendom can expett no relief from her spiritual famine, Their condemnation of single weapons while lifting not a finger against the carnage of war itself is typical of them and is like fighting a forest fire with an eye-dropper. It is likewise evident that their many words in such vein have as little effect with God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Once again terrible flames of violence, fanned by Catholics and Protestants, are licking the heels of Jehovah's witnesses, in the Eastern zone. The crazed communists are attempting to accomplish what the demonized Nazis could not. But firsthand reports from behind the iron curtain also reveal that the results are the same as before—persecution is again defeated!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font2">HE pattern of persecution followed today in the territory occupied by the Russians is the same as that cut out and used by the Devil's agents against Christ Jesus and the early Christians nearly 2,000 years ago. Under totalitarian Roman rule the compromising Jewish clergy were contented and undisturbed until the honest preacher Jesus came along and exposed their errors, hypocrisy and fraudulent practices. That message inflamed those religionists with jealousy, hatred and intolerance,' and they contrived to do away with the Preacher of the truth. They scoffed and ridiculed, they threatened and reviled, they sent their crafty spies among Jesus' followers with catchy questions, and finally they brought false accusations against him and put him to death. Oh, yes, they took the trouble of giving him a mock trial, and they attempted to justify their action with a boisterous proclamation of patriotism. Shrewdly they maneuvered events to make it appear that responsibility for Jesus* death hung on the neck of Pilate the politician.—Matthew 12:14,24,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">38; 15:1,2; 19:3; 21:23,45,46; 22:15-23, 34,35,41-46; 27:1; Mark 3:6; 12:12,13; 15:1,2; Luke 6:11; 20:19,20; 22:66; 23:1, 2; John 5:16; 7:19,32, 45-47; 8:40,44,59; 19:12,14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all of these details there is a striking parallel in what has occurred during the last five years in Eastern Germany. When the Nazi concentration camps were smashed open, out walked thousands of Jehovah's witnesses who had survived up to 12 years of imprisonment, and once again these faithful Christians went about preaching their happy message. They told the people, not only the good news that God’s kingdom is the only hope for sincere and honest people, but also that this theocratic kingdom was established in the heavens in 1914. The leaders of both Catholicism and Protestantism, having rejected God's kingdom as the only hope, and being a very important part of this present evil world, lost no time in denouncing these devout Christians before the new Communist bosses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the false charges now made by the Soviet administration first appeared in official publications of Catholic and Protestant organizations. As, for example, the preposterous lies that the witnesses are an American organization engaged in espionage service for imperialism, and they stir up the population against the People’s Republic of Communism, and are therefore a threat to Germany’s social rebuilding program. A stream of lies flooded forth to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">arouse the political powers against the witnesses. They accomplished their wicked purpose, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is an old trick, when evil ones in authority desire to do away with a small and defenseless minority, to stir up the spirit of ignorant masses to accomplish their purpose. This makes it appear that the majority approves and democratic rule prevails. Such an instance occurred in the district around Behnsdorf in May, 1949. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font2"> female burgomaster of this town, formerly a rabid fascistic nazi but now one who claims to be an ardent communist, called a mass meeting and read a resolution demanding that the witnesses be banned as a “murderous organization”. Posters were put up about town spreading the lie that these innocent Christians offered blood sacrifices to their God, and warning people not to allow the witnesses to enter their homes, since they were only looking for new victims to sacrifice. It was the same wicked lie the nazis used against the Jews, but it accomplished its intended purpose. With the whole community stirred Up the police then outlawed the Bible meetings of the witnesses. Even private studies of the Bible were broken up. Everywhere the witnesses went—down the streets or in the stores to do their shopping—senseless mobs set upon and beat them. The windows in their homes were smashed, their furniture and belongings were seriously damaged, and other injuries were suffered at the hands of these wild mobsters. The demons were certainly on the loose, and it was some time before the higher governmental authorities stepped in to restore law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spies Give False Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a certain village one of Jehovah’s witnesses who had given a public talk was called before the Russian commander. The charge was that he had talked about a coming “big war” in which those on the “left” would be destroyed and those on the “right” would begin living in a lovely new world. The commander interpreted the “big war” to be World War IH, those on the “left” to be the Communists, and those on the “right” to be the reactionaries and Nationalists. The witness then told the commander what he had said. He explained that the “big war” he had talked about was the battle of Armageddon, to be fought between Christ Jesus and Satan the Devil. As for those on the “right” and “left”, the speaker pointed out that he was talking about the parable of the “sheep and goats” recorded in Matthew </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">25.</span><span class="font2"> The commander was fully satisfied, but wondered how his informers made such a stupid report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But this report was no more ridiculous than other nonsensical “evidence&quot; turned in against Jehovah’s witnesses. Under pressure from the modem religious Pharisees the Communists sent their own specially trained spies to the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. When a report was given on the Watch Tower Society’s president, Mr. N. H. Knorr, and his visit to Germany in 1947, these roguish spies scribbled down in their notebooks: ‘The speaker admitted having talked to American agents.’ Again, when a Bible study meeting was opened with prayer and the conductor asked the great Jehovah God to bless the president of the Watch Tower Society and his fellow ministers in Brooklyn, New York, down went the notation ‘Jehovah’s witnesses pray for the victory of America*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These unprincipled informers mingled privately with the witnesses and asked many catch questions. For instance, “What is your idea of the Soviet government?” A witness would then take time to explain that Jehovah’s witnesses are true followers of Christ, that they copy his pattern and devote themselves to God’s kingdom, and hence preserve strict political neutrality, giving Caesar what belongs to him and at the same time giving God what is rightfully God’s. However, these unscrupulous and wicked men wrote down in their notebooks: <sup>ft</sup>Jehovah’s witnesses are against Caesar, against Stalin and against the Soviet government,” The exact opposite from what was said!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">See how this parallels the accusation against Christ, concerning which it is written: &quot;They sent out men secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous, in order that they might catch him [Jesus] in speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor, And these men questioned him, saying: <sup>1</sup> ... Is it lawful for us to pay tax to Caesar or not?’ He said to them: ‘By all means, then, pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God? Well, they were not able to catch him in this saying before the people, but, in amazement at his answer, they said nothing.” However, later on in the courtroom the accusation was brought against Jesus: “This man we found subverting our nation and forbidding the paying of taxes to C a e s a r?’—Luke 20:20-22, 25, 26; 23:2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So the Devil’s tactics against true Christians have not changed much in 2,000 years. As then, so now the truth is seized upon, twisted, completely removed from its setting, and mixed with a mass of deliberate lies, and then used to incriminate and conviot innocent people. Some of the “evidence” turned in by the Communist spies was so ridiculous and far-fetched even an official of the Soviet administration was overheard to say: “Such foolish stuff. People know Jehovah’s witnesses better than to believe that!” But what did that matter? It was of little consequence that such so-called “evidence” was not the truth, it would still be used in the Communist trials to send Jehovah’s witnesses to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">a prison camp, and if anyone objected, they too could receive the same treatment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christians Kidnaped by Gestapo</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When false arrests and imprisonments failed to stop Jehovah’s witnesses the Com-&quot;munlsts tried to intimidate them with torture and cruelty. *TTiis particular campaign of terror began in February, 1950, when Paul Grossmann, a prominent member of the Watch Tower staff in Magdeburg, suddenly disappeared. He had gone to the home of a supposedly interested person to help him study his Bible. An investigation was started and a reward pf DM 1,000 was posted for any information on the crime, but it soon developed that the police were doing everything possible to cover up the matter. It was then learned that the supposedly interested person was an agent of the Soviet State Security Service, so representatives of the Watch Tower Society went to the state attorney general in Halle demanding that he investigate this crime. Helplessly, he admitted that Grossmann had been kidnaped and turned over to “higher authorities”, and consequently he could do nothing. “I am not allowed to say anything,” he kept repeating with his head hung in shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two other members of the Bethel staff of the Watch Tower Society in Magdeburg were also kidnaped in a similar fashion. Also Paul Schwarz, a circuit servant for the Watch Tower Society, and his wife were pounced upon in Schwerin by the police and turned over to the mysterious “higher authorities”, who turned out to be Eastern Germany’s Gestapo organization which is controlled by the Russians. Not until several months had passed was it learned that Schwarz had been sentenced to 25 years of hard labor and was in the concentration camp of Bautzen, He had spent many years in Hitler’s concentration camps and now he was sentenced to spend another 25 years, his only crime being the fact that he was a faithful and true Christian!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not all kidnaped were thrown into the labor camps. Several were released after receiving brutal treatment, to allow them to spread fear among the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses. For example, there was a well-known chiropractor in Magdeburg, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who was notified to appear at the office of the public health. Asked several routine questions about his business and related matters, the discussion finally turned to Biblical topics. The official feigned great interest. It being about noontime, the official invited the witness to accompany him in his car and tell him more about the Bible, Ufton reaching the car and being introduced to another man the witness was forcibly thrown in and driven off at high speed. Yes, he too was being kidnaped by the Russian Gestapo, At their headquarters he was grilled all night with questions and at the same time was threatened that much worse things were in store for him if he persisted in his beliefs.

<p><span class="font2">Well, how did Jehovah’s witnesses react to this brutality? Did fear and terror spread through their ranks and slow down their preaching? Not in the least! Like early Christians they joyfully suffered the plundering, knowing that through such experiences they were gaining an abiding possession. “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted,” They endured these hardships as good soldiers of Christ, and God blessed their efforts by expanding their numbers. (Hebrews 10:34; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2 Timothy</span><span class="font2"> 2:3; 3:12, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font2"> Just think of it, from January to July, 1950, the number of those preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Eastern Germany jumped from 20,386 to 23,220!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But this overwhelming manifestation of Jehovah’s blessing upon his people was too much for their enemies, and so on August 30 the government of the Soviet zone launched its all-out effort to suppress Jehovah's witnesses completely. On September 4 public announcement was made that the organization and activity of these Christians were officially banned, and within 24 hours 1,000 of the most prominent witnesses were rounded up and thrown in prison. Some were sentenced to life, others drew long terms at hard labor, and in many of these cases the sentences were equivalent to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Devil concluded that if he killed Christ he would put an end to Christianity. He failed Next he tried to stop it by persecuting and martyring the apostles and disciples. Again he failed. Many of the Devil’s servants haye since attempted the same thing and have also failed. Hitler the paper hanger, in spite of the fact that he was backed wp and supported by the pope, also failed in his folly, and Jehovah's witnesses came back stronger than ever!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now, do the Communists imagine such a vain thing as to think they will succeed where others have failed? Impossible! Better they try blotting out the literal sun than attempt to eclipse and destroy the shining of the true Sun of Righteousness, the glorified Christ. Officially puny men may ban and outlaw God’s witnesses, but all good and honest people of Soviet Germany know that by God’s grace and in His strength His faithful witnesses will continue preaching this good news of the new world kingdom, whether chained or free, whether inside or outside of prison, whether above oh under ground!—Romans 8:35-39; 2 Corinthians 11:23-28; Ephesians 6:18-20; Colossians 4:2-4.</span></p><img src="g_E_19510422_files/g_E_19510422-5.png" alt="" style="width:316pt;height:132pt;">
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark16"></a>-True and False</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font2">CCORDING to both the Bible and the dictionary, religion is a form of worship. The apostle James speaks of a “form of worship” which the old Latin-speaking Christians called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">religid<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">1</a></sup></span><span class="font2"> (See James 1:27, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.,</span><span class="font2"> footnote.) Webster defines religion as being, among other things, “The service and adoration of God or a god as expressed in forms of worship in obedience to divine commands?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Man’s faculties of reason, imagination, conscience and emotion all play their part in causing him to worship, fear and seek to please someone greater than himself But without knowledge of the true religion he gropes blindly and erects an altar to an &quot;Unknown God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The true religion should teach us to know and reverence the true God. It should show us the way to life and should appeal to our reason by being consistent with itself and in harmony with the known facts. It should give us an appreciation of what is right and wrong, and free us from error, superstition and fear. Of the many religions in the world, which one meets these requirements?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hinduism and Buddhism</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the oldest living organized religions in the world is Hinduism. In this religion the thing of paramount importance is caste. “No one is interested in what his neighbor believes, but he is very much in</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">terested in knowing whether he can eat </span><span class="font2">withhEoESbiSteri</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">fam hlshandg.</span><span class="font2">’<sup>1 </sup>There are four main castes which in turn are divided into </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">3,000</span><span class="font2"> castes and </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">10,000 subcast</span><span class="font2">es. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Caste j§_ hereditary and dejter</span><span class="font2">^ </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mines oqcj^aTjo</span><span class="font2">mMost Wretched were the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">outcastes</span><span class="font2"> or the “untouchables’<sup><a href="#bookmark17">1</a></sup> who, because of violating the rules of their caste, were considered as being without caste. Their very shadow was deemed to defile one with caste. Gandhi in particular championed their cause and on April 30, 1947, the Constituent Assembly in India in framing the new constitution </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">adopted a pro</span><span class="font2"></span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">posal that abolished untouchability</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">N</span><span class="font2">ORTHERN Rhodesia is ready to display its wares to the big game hunt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ers of the world. Little disturbed since the arrival of the white man in this vast territory, the game has thrived and multiplied m certain areas to magnificent proportions. And now, after careful planning by the organization built up to control Northern Rhodesia’s wild animals, the immense Luangwa valley, home of almost every African game species, is to be opened up to hunting parties.” This opening statement in a government pamphlet, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Big Game Safari^</span><span class="font2"> excites interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Glancing quickly at a map one finds the Luangwa river running in a more or less north and south direction down through a valley by the same name, in the northeastern part of the country, near the very heart of Africa. But one must visit the region to be transported back to the Africa that existed centuries before the European entered the country. This place, known as a rift valley, Is v/alled In on either side by mountainous escarpments running several hundred miles and which form barriers that hinder and in places defy passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The valley’s greatest claim to fame and fortune, however, is the fauna which it holds in its bosom. During the dry season, when the water holes and small streams disappear, multitudes of wild animals congregate along the banks of the Luangwa river in almost unbelievable numbers. Here one finds in great abundance practically every kind of big game for which Africa is famous, besides innumerable smaller creatures. Now these are the “wares” that are being offered to American big game hunters in an effort to lure U. S. dollars into Northern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanguine Carnival for Modern Nimrods</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hunters who are out to adorn the walls of their homes, dubs and sporting dens with trophies from this virgin field must pay a considerable sum for the privilege. The government supervises the whole business, conducting hunters in groups of four on a two-week safari at a cost of £200 ($561) per person. This indudes the services of an experienced game ranger, four African game scouts, and boys to care for the camp, cooking, etc. If “non-shooters” want to go along just to take photographs they may do so at a reduced rate, £150 ($420.75) each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The high limit set on the number of animals each hunter is permitted to kill certainly impresses one with the extravagant waste of life and wanton slaughter allowed. Two elephants, four buffaloes and one each of the following: kudu, Cookson’s wildebeest, roan antelope, hartebeest, waterbuck, bushbuck, duiker, oribi, reedbuck, klipspringer, zebra, impala. The following may be killed without limit, since they are considered vermin: lions, leopards, hyenas, warthogs, bush pigs, baboons and crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Lundazi district of the valley six camp sites have been established for the convenience of the hunters. These consist of three rondawel huts and a kitchen shelter. besides grass latrine and bath shelters. In addition to these six camps there is one in another district known as Chief Nsefu’s Game camp, an altogether different type, for there only shooting with a camera is permitted- Excellent opportunities for game photography are afforded— close-ups of elephants, rhinos and buffaloes—as well as superb studies of graceful antelopes. But for those interested, it is well to heed what the sportsman’s Handbook says: “Big game photography, however, can be a dangerous pursuit, so visitors are warned to have a reliable shot covering them when taking pictures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is a prudent warning for those “citified” people coming out here who have only seen docile elephants performing at a circus or eating peanuts in a zoo, and who underestimate these big fellows as clumsy creatures. In his native habitat the elephant can be anything but docile or clumsy. Notoriously poor of eyesight, yes, but equipped with extremely keen senses pf hearing and smell, they can quickly locate an enemy when aroused and charge them with the speed of an express train. The African elephant is a formidable sight when charging. His enormous ears fanned out on each side of his head, in some cases reaching a spread of fifteen feet, give him the appearance of a mountainside bearing down on one. Professional ivory hunters have fervent respect for this monarch, and some of the old-timers with whom this correspondent has conversed estimate that a few years ago the average life of an Ivory hunter was only about five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be observed in passing that the elephant can be made to work as a beast of burden. There is a school in the Belgian Congo to the north of here where the African elephant has been successfully trained to do domestic duties comparable to those long performed by his cousin in India. And so in a machinery-short country like Africa this fact underscores the gross sin in allowing a wanton killing off of these majestic creatures just for the sport of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hunters Bisk Being Hunted</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let all visitors to this section take note that Homo </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sapiens</span><span class="font2"> is not the only one that knows how to hunt; some of the native beasts have quite a reputation themselves. Once a lion acquires the taste for human flesh he becomes as bold and daring in his pursuit as any two-legged Nimrod. A long-time resident of this area relates an experience he had with the “local Hon” here a few years ago. He and his native helpers were sleeping practically surrounded by fires yet Mr, Leo crept in and made off with a native.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The buffalo must also be respected. Most numerous of the big game in this valley, they travel in groups of five or six, or sometimes several hundred may be encountered. Usually if left strictly alone they mind their own business, but when angered it is said that no more deadly or cunning a foe will be found in the whole animal kingdom. They may lay perfectly motionless until a pursuer is upon them and then like a flash they are upon their feet charging. Not only do they bring the fierceness of their powerful horns to bear, they use their cruel hoofs too, pawing and trampling until a victim is a mass of pulp. Particularly dreaded and feared is their strategy of circling back on their tracks and attacking pursuers from the rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Visitors to this, resourceful valley may have the misfortune of meeting up with another very dangerous inhabitant, the black rhinoceros. In fact, this character is so extremely short-tempered and belligerent, with apparently no sense of humor, it is wise if at all possible to avoid him completely. They are known to attack elephants twice their size. Rhinos have poor eyesight, but their sense of smell and sharp ears more than make up for the handicap. However, their main weapons are the two horns on their ugly head. The one on their nose measures up to 43 inches and the one in the middle of their forehead is as much as 21 inches. When charging they hurl as much as three tons of weight at a target at a speed faster than a man can run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Creeluremf the Jungle</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Leaving the more vicious members to their own company, the visitor can meet many peaceful African animals in this valley, as for example the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">tall</span><span class="font2">, gawky giraffe. This is one of the few places where they can still be found. Then there are the chubby striped zebras that one is bound to see because of multitude. A close watch will be rewarded by a glimpse of as many as sixteen varieties of antelope—some numbering in the thousands and some very rare, some, like the giant eland, as much as 5 or 6 feet in height at the shoulder, and some as tiny as the duiker, a mite just over a foot in height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The valley is also a great sanctuary for members of the feathered realm. Many types of ducks and geese are here, and several varieties of quail, francolin, guinea fowl and grouse are scattered over the foothills and at the bases of the escarpments. Not only the muddy banks of the Luangwa and its numerous tributaries, but also the streams themselves swarm with an abundance of wildlife. Around most all the pools and streams crocodiles are to be found basking in the warm sunshine, and there is hardly a stretch of the river that does not have its own particular school of hippopotami. Throughout the night their presence is manifest by the sound of their splashing and grunting. In fact, the noise of the jungle denizens—the mixed chorus of grunts, squeals, growls and roarings— will long linger in the memory of all who visit this more or less untouched region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All who have in mind the promises of Jehovah God eagerly look forward to the time in the near future when universal and eternal peace will settle down even in Luangwa valley. Neither dollar shortage nor the sportsman’s “thrill” to kill will cause hunters to invade and spoil this lovely region. Perfect friendship with absence of fear will be the lot of all creation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">P</span><span class="font12">UBLIC opinion can be a cruel thing. When a current of feeling attains the proportions of mass sentiment, when the majority think along the same lines, the way of minority thinkers becomes hard. The majority brand the minority with all the names and characteristics of the hated enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt; American public opinion, and the opinion of most countries closely tied to America, is jelling into a hard core of hate and fear of communism. What to do about communism and how to do it are pretty clearly defined ideas in the minds of the majority. There are others who oppose communism just as ardently but have </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font12"> opinions as to what should be done and how it should be done. There are some who strive to retain a balance of mind to the point of uttering the unthinkable fact that even communism's enemies can be in some measure to blame for the world’s woes, and that all would not be roses if there were no communist menace. There are some who go so far as to say that no worldly power can eradicate curses like communism and establish a righteous order of peace and security —but that such a cleansing work will have to be wrought by powers greater than men and nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt; Such minority thinkers and unorthodox spokesmen are the scapegoats of the majority. But such abuse is not becoming, even from the majority. It is the opinion of the United States attorney general, J. Howard </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">McGrath, that such</span><span class="font12"> abuse is more harmful than the opinions of the minority. Pseudopatriots, who ignorantly brand the unorthodox minority group of Christians known as Jehovah's witnesses as &quot;communists” and who “play right into the communists' hands&quot;, would do well to consider this: There are over one hundred thousand Jehovah's witnesses actively preaching their Bible message every month throughout the United States. Jehovah’s witnesses have been thoroughly investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That investigation has not altered the activities or message of Jehovah’s witnesses one lota, and the witnesses increase in numbers every month. Yet the attorney general declares **we have the Communist fifth column well under control”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">C Evidently Attorney General McGrath must refer to some one other than Jehovah’s witnesses, and their maligners should be at ease about their havlhg anything in common with communism. Speaking on the subject of the present hysterical practice of branding ev«y nonconformist with the Red label, Mr. McGrath declared in a Jackson Day address on January 13 at Springfield, Missouri, among others things (New York Times, January 14, 1951):</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">C “We have an efficient Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent sabotage and to keep track of Communist espionage, maneuverings and conspiracies.&quot; “But,&quot; he continued, J. Edgar Hoover and I are determined that there will be no gestapo witch hunts—that basic civil rights of the individual will be securely protected and defended as guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt; Discussing public feeling during the current emergency, the attorney general said he had been “concerned about those who would smear every opposition sentiment with the label of communism—men who would penalize the thinking of unorthodox thoughts, or the writing of nonconformist words&quot;. He asserted: &quot;Those who pose as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the saviors</span><span class="font12"> of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">aur </span><span class="font12">nation by seeking to abridge beyond reason our tradition of democratic freedom are as dangerous to American liberties as the Communists themselves. For in destroying that fabric of democracy and reason, they play directly into V<sup>16</sup> hands of the Kremlin’s agents. We must be ever alert and on guard to protect the rights of the constructive critic. We must be careful to use the words ‘disloyal’ and ‘subversive’ with caution. They should not be used as synonyms for 'critical’ and ‘uno rtho dox*.’ '-—Con tributed.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font2">USTRALIA is a big place, and, per capita, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. In square miles it is the same size as the United States, but its population is less than the population of New York city, only 7,579,358 people. So if you can picture the United States with only the population of New York city as its sole inhabitants, then you have a fairly good picture of what Australia is like, with only seven and one-half million persons spread over its 2,947,581 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the total population, but 20,000 are known to be members of the Australian Communist Party, the communists’ governing body in Australia. But the power and influence of communism, exercised chiefly through the trade unions, is immeasurably greater than the figure suggests. The party dominates some of the most important industrial organizations, its members hold executive positions in others, and they exert increasing influence on many unions still under what are called “moderate” officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hence, despite their obvious minority, the communists boast that independent of Parliamentary representation they can effectively control Australia through the trade unions. Being a minority has not hindered them any more than it has the Com</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">munist party in Russia which governs a population of 170 million, while itself a party that in 1947 claimed a membership of a mere 6,300/100. To illustrate their point is the fact that in the last Australian Federal elections 87,958 persons voted for communist candidates. While but a fraction of the total vote, this is over four times the official Australian Communist Party membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Up until only a few years ago, most Australians thought of the Communist party as an ordinary political organization; but over the last five years it has been brought home to even the unconcerned that the communists, through union and other influence, are following a program of fomenting dissatisfaction among all classes of workers, developing class hatred; and by a series of worker-strikes they have shown how they can ruin overseas trade (as in the Indonesian case), break the city’s power supplies, and thus bring the state to a halt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, when the leader of the Liberal party announced in his policy speech before the 1949 Federal elections that among other things he would take steps to destroy the communists’ grip in Australia, his party was overwhelmingly voted into power. Four months later, in April 1950, Mr. Menzies as prime minister introduced to the House of Representatives at Canberra what has become known as the “anti-Red bill”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Bill and Its Main Objections </span><span class="font2">In the preamble to the bill are the recitals that the Communist party in Australia (1) aims at establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) seeks the overthrow of the present government and attainment of its own ends by force; (3) is part of a world-wide communist party known to engage in sabotage to gain these ends; (4) and (5) is a menace to the security and smooth operation of many Australian industries vital to the land’s defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are six main provisions of the bill itself:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1) Dissolution of the Australian Communist Party,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2) Provision that any associations controlled by communists or advocating communism may be declared unlawful. Such bodies have the right to appeal to the High Court of Australia but will have the onus of proving themselves innocent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(3) Officers and members of unlawful associations are under penalty of imprisonment to cease their activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(4) Where a' person was a member of such bodies and the government is satisfied that ‘any activities of that person are likely to be prejudicial to the defense of the commonwealth, he may be declared. The declared one may appeal to the High Court but will have the onus of proving himself innocent The onus of proof shifts to the crown if he gives evidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(5) Any person so declared will be disqualified from employment under the commonwealth,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(6) If the government (governor general formally) is satisfied that members of an industrial organization (a union) are engaged in “key industries'* vital to the defense, that organization may be declared accordingly. The result is that a person declared under provision 4 shall be disqualified from holding office in that organization or union. No disability is imposed on the organization. (Communists are defined as persons who have been members or officers of the Communist party since May 10,1948, the last day of the congress at which the party’s constitution was adopted.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">House and Senate reactions by different factions within the opposition Labor party proved interesting. Against those who thought the bill too severe ranged the Catholic faction who favored it chiefly on grounds of their religious organization’s commitments. Principal objections were </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">directed</span><span class="font2"> against the clause </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">known</span><span class="font2"> as the “onus of proof” clause, under which the person declared bears the burden of proving himself innocent. A great cry went up from all parts of the country that this clause was a “denial of the principles of British justice”. So it is, but it is not new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">British Justice</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trial</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What are some of the basic principles of British justice as they apply to the individual? Briefly these include the principle that no man shall be detained without a charge being laid against him; that no man shall be imprisoned without a fair trial; and that an accused person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yet in one of his decisions, the late Sir Frederick Jordan, when chief justice of New South Wales, indicated that Australia^ own National Security Act was guilty of flouting these very principles. It can be mentioned that this National Security Act was described by the Sydney </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald</span><span class="font2"> as an act “which strikes at the very roots of Parliamentary government”. And this law was conceived, brought forth and used against the Australian people by the same R. G. Menzies during his first term as prime minister. So the “anti-Red” bill’s onus-of-proof clause is not original with it. Scattered feeble objections have previously been made to its enforcement, such as the comments referred to by Sir Frederick Jordan. But aside from talk, nothing has been done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other examples of crossing the line of these British principles can be cited As well. In the Crimes Act the statutes dealing with customs and revenue all provide that an official averment is to he taken as prima-facie proof of guilt. Similarly, the commissioner of taxation may, and sometimes does, exercise the most far-reaching rights of search and seizure of documents and cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And so it seems that many supposedly inherent British rights, particularly the assumption of innocence until proved guilty, have been side-tracked, altered and whittled away until mere shadows of their former weight- Indeed, the reverse of the assumption of innocence is now almost the rule rather than the exception. Though some Labor senators were highly indignant about this provision of the bill, it is curious to note that they did not object to the same clause when it first appeared in the National Security Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other arguments flared up and delay after delay occurred to block passage of the bill. At one stage the government threatened to dissolve Parliament and go to the people on the issue. Finally, however, the Labor Party executive directed that all opposition was to be withdrawn and the bill eventually became law on October 20, 1950, six months after its introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Issue Carried to the Courts</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the bestowal of royal assent, making the act law, the Communist party and ten unions immediately rushed to the High Court to challenge the validity of the act. Communist union bosses squealed “treachery to the workers”; militant communist organizers raced around in all directions to fix stop-work meetings as protests against the bill. Meanwhile, after the preliminaries, the High Court settled down to some steady listening. The hearing lasted twenty-three days, at an estimated cost of about £28,000 so far. And now the Judgment of the court is awaited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the interim the act is suspended, the tumult and shouting have died for the time, the lawyers have stepped aside and the communists are pursuing a policy of aggressive silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The communists in Australia have been rightly attacked for their industrial agitation and other forms of fomenting strife and civil chaos to further their revolutionary aims. But no word has been uttered against their campaign to discredit Almighty God. It is true, the Catholic Church has raised a bit of a shout now and then from her sheltered pulpits, but not in honor of God; rather to attract attention to herself. Literally hundreds of people have offered themselves as exposers of communism, but none have seen fit to reveal the communist plan to turn followers and fellow travelers into a pack of atheists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In interesting contrast to communists and to Christendom, Jehovah’s witnesses are not involved in politics, commerce or false religion. They are only interested in drawing people’s attention to the promises of Jehovah as set out in the Bible. It is because communism seeks to take the place of God’s kingdom and induces multitudes to turn away from the Creator that they now bear witness against this godlessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Australia, as in all the world, Jehovah’s witnesses observe impartially the battle for political supremacy and the plight of the perplexed people caught in between. Knowing God’s Word, they realize that communism is no antidote for Christendom’s failures, and that its day of final judgment at the hand of the God it denies is near. From that there will be no appeal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font2">N THIS day of complex inventions, the harried reader of the public press frequently encounters reports of electronic computers which are capable of performing mathematical operations at prodigious speeds. In the vernacular of our day they are sometimes known as “giant brains”, or by such abbreviated titles as: ENIAC, UNIV AC, SWAC, SEAC, BIN AC, RE AC, EDVAC, and, curiously enough, one by the foreboding name of MANIAC. To those humans who hate mathematics, perhaps the one abbreviated “Maniac” is the most appropriate of all such titles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Almost every phase of human endeavor requires the use of the science of mathematics in one form or another. Everyone, whether prince or pauper, artisan or atomic physicist, has need of it at times. Insurance companies, banking institutions, mailorder houses, engineering firms, the census bureau, and scores of industrial institutions employ hundreds of bookkeepers, clerks, and statisticians who devote all their time to nothing other than making Aiathematical computations. A great portion of the work these employees do consists of bulky repetitive operations which can be performed far more speedily and efficiently by using electronic devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But what is of particular interest at this time is not merely the speed and economy electronic devices inherently possess, but rather the far-reaching possibilities involved in the principles used in their construction, principles which can be applied</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to great advantage for many purposes other than for computation only. By employing certain functions embodied in the operation of these modern “thinking machines”, the completely automatic factory is envisaged to be a distinct possibility in the not too distant future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Some of Their Accomplishments</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to appreciate to a degree the diverse possibilities presaged by these modem automatons, consider for a moment some of the near-human operations they are performing today. One such machine evolved by the Bell Telephone Laboratories has a part within itself called a “discriminator”, that is, a part which can compare, select, or decide—can discriminate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The discriminator can decide whether a number is positive or negative; whether it is zero or not zero. The discriminator can stop the machine; it can stop the problem the machine may be working on and proceed to another problem; it can distinguish between right and wrong results; it can determine that a certain result is impossible; it can recognize that a certain result is the right answer; it can check a number against a tolerance; and, when a problem has been solved, it will proceed to another. Should the regular power supply fail, it will switch itself over to a stand-by battery power supply and pro-ce$4 on with its work without the assistance of anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Incredible, do you say? Seemingly so, perhaps. But what will you say of some of the feats performed by others of these esoteric prodigies? Such as those that are capable of learning what they are instructed to do; can apply instructions when needed, look up numbers in tables, memorize numbers, words, or pictures; can communicate automatically over any distance, and can set other machines in motion, keep watch over them and correct their actidn, keep accounts and make reports at any desired stage. Furthermore, one called “SWAC’ (Standards Western Automatic Computer), it is claimed, can translate from a foreign language to English and vice versa. Even though the translations admittedly are faulty, do not such accomplishments portend the day coming when the monotonous continuity of certain repetitive operations can be taken over largely by automatic electronic machinery? Who would not speed such a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Electronic Computers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Turning to the mathematical aspects of these modern electronic “brains”, their accomplishments are startling; the complexity of the problems they can solve and the speed with which they can obtain correct results are astounding. For example, one computer in operation can multiply two twelve-digit numbers (such as, 999,999,999,999 and 999,999,999,999) in onethousandth of a second. It would take a man about five minutes to do it the longhand way, or about 300,000 times as long. In an 18-hour test it did millions of multiplications without making an error! And it did it without even pausing to nibble on a pencil.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19510422_files/g_E_19510422-12.png" alt="" style="width:224pt;height:190pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Additions of two tendigit numbers can he performed at the rate of 15,625 a second. The value of “pi” (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) can be computed to two thousand decimal places in two days' time; it required five years for a mathematician using longhand methods to make the same computation to only 707 decimal places. As many as 150 simultaneous algebraic equations in many unknowns and involving millions of arithmetical operations can be performed in four hours. What is more, they will solve complex problems in higher mathematics, problems which would require a lifetime of mental drudgery for mathematicians to work out, some so complex and lengthy they are impossible to solve in the ordinary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As an instance, consider what was done during the latter part of 1950 and as reported in the public press. Using the selective sequence electronic calculator of IBM, in four weeks' time the orbits of the five outer planets of the solar system (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) were computed forward to A.D. 2060 and also backward to A.D. 1653. To do the herculean job required the solution of a thirtiethorder simultaneous differential equation involving ninety force factors acting upon the five heavenly bodies. The orbits were computed at forty-day intervals and each one had to be computed before the next one could be obtained. The mathematical work involved in the project was enormous; astronomers will appreciate its importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Machines with Memories</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SEAC, the $250,000 eastern brother of SWAC, can also add, subtract, multiply and divide at lightning speed. Being one of the more recent developments, it has an improved memory. While certain other computers use punched cards, paper tape, or magnetized surfaces to store away information needed for future reference, SEAC uses columns of liquid mercury for that purpose. It also employs a second form of memory device for greater speed, a device which resembles the picture tube of a television receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The portion of SEAC’s memory using the mercury columns stores away or memorizes numbers in the form of coded sound waves. At any time they are required these numbers can be “brought to mind” in the brief space of time of 168-millionths of a second. The picture tube section of Its memory is still more speedy; it can recall numbers in twelve-millionths of a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Memories are just as important for electronic computers as they are for humans, and more so. You see, it comes about this way: electronic computers are speedy because they use vacuum tubes, or their equivalent, as are used in radio receivers. Electrons move about in their circuits at velocities anywhere up to 186,000 miles a second. In order to slow down this high velocity in certain parts of the computer, the electrical pulses carrying the numbers are converted into mechanical waves In the liquid mercury. This is done in much the same manner as when a loud-speaker produces sound waves in air. The mechanical waves are transmitted through the columns of mercury and then reconverted into electrical pulses. Waves passing through the mercury travel much more slowly than do electrical pulses in their circuits. The delay is short, of the order of 336 microseconds, but it is of sufficient length of time to store as many as 1,344 digits. These digits are “brought to mind” by the computer whenever it needs them. It is seen, therefore, that time delay in an electrical or mechanical circuit is equivalent to memory in the human brain. Using only one such memory device in a computer is equal to the work done by as many as 550 vacuum tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SEAC does most of its thinking with 12,800 germanium crystal diodes instead of the more expensive and bulky vacuum tubes. Germanium diodes are the modern descendants of the “cat-whisker” galena detectors used in old-time radio receivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SEAC’s diodes are capable of receiving instructions in the form of electrical pulses at the rate of a million a second. It is completely electronic, with no mechanical parts in its operation, and resembles in appearance nothing other than a neat row of gray telephone racks filled with an assortment of radio gadgets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">How They</span><span class="font2"> Worft</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many find people hard to understand. Many will also find these modem electronic “brains” difficult to fathom. They are of two general types or families. These are named “digital” and “analog”, in accordance with the manner in which they operate. The digital family perform their computations in a step-by-step manner just as one does when counting things with the digits of his hands. All the mathematical operations in digital machines are reduced to the simple operations of arithmetic— addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Subtraction is done by adding the ones complement of the subtrahend and then using “end around carry”; multiplication is repetitive addition; and division is repetitive subtraction. Thus all the operations of arithmetic can be reduced to the one of addition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The analog family, on the other hand, perform in a continuous manner. As an example, the speedometer of a car registers the rate at which the car moves continuously, rather than in jerks, step by step. As the family name indicates, these computers use electrical analogies to represent physical quantities. Thus, a voltage, a current or a resistance may be used to simulate such physical quantities as force, weight, flow, height, damping, and other physical quantities. Adjusting the electrical analogies in the computer to correspond to the magnitude of the physical quantities involved in a problem, the computer can be made to determine precisely what variations will be experienced<sup>1</sup> throughout a definite cycle of time. Analog computers, therefore, are ideally suited for solving such problems as pertain to the flight of airplanes, the motion of ships, the trajectories of missiles, or the orbits of planets, etc., whereas digital computers are better suited for accurate, high-speed, arithmetical operations. The present trend in computer designs is toward the digital type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Examining and pondering over the inner workings of one of these modern digital “thinking” machines, one can understand how the amazing feats are achieved. Consider, for instance, how they add. Electronic “brains” use a different kind of language than humans do; their system of notation is different too. Whereas we commonly use a system of notation employing ten digits—0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9—and known as the decimal system, they use one of several systems of notation; one is known as “binary” and others as “biquinary”, “octal/’ etc. Those “brains” using binary notation do all their arithmetic using only two digits—zero and one. Any number, regardless of its size, can be represented by these two digits; moreover, any problem involving arithmetical operations, or even the higher mathematical operations of differentiation and integration, can be solved by using nothing other than zero and one. Strange as it may seem, yet such is a fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In binary notation zero is written as 0, one as 1, two as 10, three as 11, four as 100, five as 101, six as 110, seven as 111, eight as 1000, nine as 1001. It is readily understood that one may combine these units to form numbers of any size. The reason the binary system is used in certain computers is that vacuum tubes know just two conditions; they either conduct or they do not conduct; they are either “on” or they are “off”. In the binary system, when a tube is “on”, it is equivalent to writing one; when it is “off”, it is equivalent to writing “0”. Since a tube can be switched on and off electrically millions of times every second, it is seen that numbers can be manipulated at lightning speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ordinary arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are performed much more easily in the binary system than in our common decimal system. The reason is that the result of all <sub>t</sub> possible operations is always either zero or one, nothing else. To understand this, try to add 33 and 29 in binary. Thirty-three translated to binary is 100001; 29 in binary is 11101. Writing one number under the other and addtransmitted to the “brain” In the form of short electrical pulses at the rate of millions per second* The numbers are arranged by the network m columns, each containing only two digits, and added one column at a time. When zero and zero in a column are added the sum is transmitted as zero; zero and one as one; and one and one as zero, but a one is carried to the next column in accordance with the binary method; and so on and on, one column after another at lightning speed until all the digits are added. The answer is automatically translated to the decimal system and then is written by an electric typewriter on a roll of paper*</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19510422_files/g_E_19510422-13.png" alt="" style="width:387pt;height:250pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">ing in the usual way the sum is 111110; translating to decimal it becomes 62. Of course, if binary were used universally the translating would be unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But how do the electronic “brains” do the adding? Here is one method. The central “nerve network” which does the adding is a simple electronic circuit using “gate” tubes as shown in the diagram. A careful study of this circuit will reveal the process. The numbers to be added are</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Their Possibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Electronic “thinking machines” have been developed to a stage where they can read, write, do arithmetic, cause motion, all at a rate ranging from a thousand to a million times faster than any person could do it* Other ways they might be used in the future for the benefit of mankind are interesting to contemplate. That automatic machinery can perform certain kinds of work far more efficiently and satisfactorily than humans can do it has been demonstrated-conclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is entirely within the realm of possibility to develop an automatic machine to handle all routine matters pertaining to production and scheduling as needed in business or factory. The machine could take in a description of an order received and another description of its* urgency. The machine would have recorded in its memory the amount of each kind of raw material needed to fill the order and the manpower needed to produce it The machine would make a schedule showing what men are to be set to work to produce the order. It would turn out the best possible production schedule showing who should do what, when, and in what sequence. The machine can be instructed to perform these and many other operations just as readily as one can set the thermostat of a heating system to instruct it to keep the temperature of a room at a certain point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Automatic typists, automatic libraries, automatic translators, automatic recognizers, automatic readers, to name but a few, are envisaged as being quite possible of development. Making use of the principles employed daily in television, in radar, in microphotography, in magnetic recording, these and many other electronic “brains” may well be employed in the future to relieve mankind of the slavery of toil and for his lasting benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Granted that automatic electronic devices have a useful role to fill for the good of mankind, yet it is freely admitted that the most intricate of all the “thinking” machines conceived to date are far inferior to the capabilities of the human brain. For none of them could be in existence without intelligent minds to create them. The most that can be said for them is that they are obedient slaves. They are slaves because they can and will do nothing other than what they are instructed to do by their human masters. Said one expert: “The more I deal with these machines the more impressed I am how dumb they are. They do nothing creative. They can only follow instructions.” Man would not have the ability to instruct them—much less to build them—had he not been endowed by the Creator with the necessary intelligence to do so. While these electronic labor- and time-saving machines are used largely in this present dying old world for selfish aggrandizement, in the new world now dawning the products of intelligent minds will be utilized instead to honor the Creator, Jehovah, as is right* Righteously disposed persons hail that day with delight. May it come speedily.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Guard Against Covetousness’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">M</span><span class="font2">ANY people have the idea that the sin which started the human race on its downward course was sexual intercourse. A little reflection and examination of the Scriptural record, however, Will reveal the incorrectness of this idea. In the first place we read that Eve first took of the forbidden fruit and then gave it to her husband. Further, God had commanded Adam and Eve to &quot;be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it*\ How could they carry out this command unless they had intercourse? And is it reasonable to conclude that God would command our first parents to do something and then punish them because they started to carry out his command? Of course not!—Genesis 1:28, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">An Avner. Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fruit which was forbidden and of which Adam and Eve ate was a literal fruit of a literal tree, for they were commanded: &quot;From every tree in the garden you are free to eat; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you must not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall certainly die-” (Genesis 2:16,17, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">An Avner. Trans A</span><span class="font2"> Their sin consisted in disobeying God, and the motive which prompted them was covetousness. Ever since that deflection of our first parents in Eden one of the prime ways in which man has succumbed to covetousness has been in seeking to acquire material wealth. Christ Jesus warned us against this desire for selfish gain, saying: &quot;Be on the alert and on guard against every kind of covetousness-”—Luke 12:15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many are the Scriptural examples which should serve as warnings to us against covetousness. (1 Corinthians 10:11) Shortly after crossing the Jordan, the Israelites received a setback because covetous Achan took spoils contrary to God’s explicit command. (Joshua 7) Only after he and his family were executed did God again prosper the Israelites. Covetousness no doubt was the real reason why King Saul disobeyed Jehovah’s command and spared the flocks of the Amalekites. For this he was rejected as king and suffered destruction. —1 Samuel 15:9-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consider also the fate of Gehazi, the servant of Elisha. Elisha had cured Naa-man of leprosy, for which Naaman offeted him gifts. Elisha refused them, but his servant Gehazi ran after Naaman and got for himself two changes of clothing and two talents of silver. Because of seeking to profit from his master’s divine gift of healing, Gehazi was smitten with leprosy. —2 Kings 5:20-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Coming to the Christian Greek Scriptures, we find that Judas got his bad start because of covetousness. Bluntly the apostle John tells us &quot;he was a thief”. (John 12:6) Ananias and Sapphira also came to untimely ends because of their covetousness.—Acts 5:1*11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many also are the Scriptural admonitions against covetousness: &quot;Labour not to be rich.” &quot;He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.” &quot;Give me neither poverty nor riches.”—Proverbs 23:4,5; 28:16; 30:8. See also Matthew 6:19,20; Luke 12:13-21; 1 Corinthians 10:24; 13:5; 1 Timothy 6:5-11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our efforts to provide things honest in the sight of all men we must be careful not to take the line of least resistance by using our Christian associations to gain material wealth. The operation of factories, Bethel homes, a radio station and the publication of much literature by the Watchtower Society brings material gain to no one. This sets the proper example for us to follow in our relationships with one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Warning of the snare of covetousness, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> September 1,1948, said: “When professed Christians get to thinking that their adoption of godliness provides ways and means for selfish worldly gain, their minds have gone bad and have become corrupted. Such persons become lost to the truth. Sometimes people will associate with the truth thinking they are going to get some personal material gain from the individuals in God’s organization, A doctor may get closely acquainted with a few of God’s people and find it convenient to drum up a patronage among them and so find business coming from the congregation, Further to attract business from the congregation, he may adopt an appearance of activity and go out with the brethren in various forms of field activity . . . The Watchtower Society does not cooperate with any such doctors, nor with others who commercialize their association with Jehovah’s witnesses.’’-Page 265,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Covetousness is a form of idolatry, selfidolatry against which the apostle warns: *‘Deaden, therefore, your body members which are upon the earth as respects . . . covetousness, which is idolatry.” And again: “Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin.” (Colossians 3:5; 1 Timothy 6:9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font2"> Please note that the rich young ruler could not be following Jesus and have his mind on preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and at the same time wondering how his many possessions were faring.—Luke 18:18-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be on guard against covetousness we must first of all be diligent to study God’s Word, Getting His mind on matters will make us content. And as we strive to follow a course of truth and righteousness we will have godliness, and “it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency” or contentment —1 Timothy 6:6, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Godliness is a healthful means of gain because it brings with it heart satisfaction, peace of mind and hope of further blessings in the new world. Our goal should be becoming rich in good works, not in becoming rich in material possessions. Christ Jesus was rich but became poor for our sakes, but how rich he became in good works! No wonder God highly exalted him and committed to him all authority in heaven and earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Often well-meaning brothers get interested in a certain therapy and argue that by greater health ihore can be done in the Lord’s service. True, but how often does it work that way? Frequently we find these so concerned over physical health that spiritual health is neglected and they devote less time than others to Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So let us keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom, ever diligent to be rich in good works and to store up treasures in heaven, remembering that there is more happiness in giving than In receiving and that the spiritual welfare of our brothers is far more important than their physical well-being. Again, “Be on the alert and on guard against every kind of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.”—Luke 12:15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

They could profit by observing the inspired proverbs ? “He that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

During </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font2">jdaythepellets descend, and in thelntesHnesTlieTiacterial protein in themis^igestedT^^en they reach the Jarge’’ffitesflnF*S5ey bypass the material in the caecum and go on into the colon where the excess moisture is absorbed to produce the familiar dry beans or droppings that are cast ^way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This phase of the cycle completed, the material stored in the dead end of the caecum next enters the colon, but instead of having all the moisture absorbed it reaches the anus in a rather soft condition. It is in pellet form with each coated with a tough layer of mucus to prevent them from sticking together. Now when these pellets reach the anus, instead of being cast away, the rabbit doubles up and takes them into the mouth and stores them away in the cardiac end of the stomach until another meal has been eaten. In this way the special rhythmic cycle is completed and most trf the food has passed a second time through the digestive tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While it may be argued that this is not a chewing of the cud as this practice exists in what is technically considered the true ruminant, yet the principle is there, and Taylor recognizes this by naming the process &quot;pseudo-rumination”, saying; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Cov-Twhaav</span><span class="font2"> [act or habit of eating dung] is too wide a term, and, as applied to mammals, is suggestive of abnormality, nor does </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">it convey any</span><span class="font2"> idea of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font2"> specialized process of alimentation now seen to take place in the rabbit; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pseudo-rumina-tion</span><span class="font2"> is, therefore, suggested until more is known about the process and a better term is found.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further showing that in a general way the rabbit’s habit can be associated with rumination, and that it may not be possible to draw too sharp a dividing line on ruminants and non-rumi-nants because of varying degrees or extents of the process, ive quote Taylor again: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the result of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">hint from R. H. Bume, with whom the possible object of pseudo-rumination, and its analogy with the process of rumination was discussed, a visit was made to the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, where along the extensive collection it was possible to compare the anatomy of a variety of mammilian stomachs. One point there made clear was the great variety of sacs, dilations, and appendages at the cardiac end of the stomachs of a large number of herbivorous mammals, forming an ascending scale of complexities leading up to the four compartments of the stomachs of some ruminants as the most complex example of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of the surprising nature of these revelations about the rabbit, and to insure the accuracy of the foregoing information, this magazine wrote to the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D, C., for confirmation. Their reply was one of unqualified agreement with the findings of Taylor and the other scientists involved. We herewith publish a facsimile copy of the letter from the Smithsonian Institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such a wonder of creation discovered by this &quot;smart” age furnishes, as Taylor observes, &quot;a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">useful reminder of the incomplete</span><span class="font2"> and uncertain nature of our knowledge, even of familiar things.’’ More im-. portant, it serves to silence the foolish rebels against God who try to mock and scoff at the infallible wisdom and knowledge long ago written down under divine inspiration in Jehovah’s Word of truth, the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Crime Exposed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">&amp; Television’s audience skyrocketed. Thousands of New Yorkers stayed home from work. Stores opened evenings because customers were glued to TV during the day. Sports fans read the front page first, and all New York was agog. Much of what they learned had been published previously, but the public had only glanced at the headlines and passed on not really noticing the corruption that existed. Now over television they viewed the crime hearings, devoured newspaper reports and reveled in the gory details of officialdom’s corruption, the likes of which has rarely come to light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One racketeer, Costello, had an astounding series of connections with other U.S. underworld characters, haa entertained O’Dwyer and other top New York politicians, has made judges, and apparently wields much more influence than politicians would like to have known. O’Dwyer, former mayor of New York where &quot;any mayor in City Hall is sitting on a powder keg’<sup>1</sup> of gambling and graft, appointed gangsters* friends to high places, and was accused of accepting an unreported $10,000 political &quot;contribution”. New Yorkers watched, listened and read, but what they saw was just one rusty link in a chain of corruption that indicates a general moral breakdown. Television served a good purpose in at last getting the information before the public. It gave New York lots of gossip material, but real reform is doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Corruption In BFC</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Political oppression and injustice are not new. Jehovah God warned Israel that a king would take the best of their fields, a tenth of their crops, their slaves, the best cattle, and they themselves would become slaves. (1 Samuel 8:Ills) Today, 3,000 years later, political corruption continues. Witness the example of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A two-year investigation of its operations told a sordid story of influence peddling, political wangling and shady deals. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font12"> magazine said (3/5), &quot;Not since the five percenters were flushed from cover in 1949 had the capital had such a titillating scandal.” One alleged influence peddler, Meri Young, received an $18,000-a-year vice-presidency from a company that borrowed $37.5 million, a $10,000-a-year salary from another, and was charged with asking $85,000 for his influence in another instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truman denied there was </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;illegal</span><span class="font12"> influence” in the RFC, but the committee chairman pointed out that the charge was &quot;improper influence” and said, 'T think it is setting a low level if our only goal for official conduct is that it be legal instead of illegal,” and that his committee had &quot;amply proven” the existence of an &quot;influence ring” centering around the White House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Republican leaders revived the slogan, &quot;Turn the Rascals Out,” and hope to use it as a campaign issue; but rascals have been turned out of politics for thousands of years, only to be replaced by others. It is not ahopeles.s case, though, unless you Look only to man’s efforts. The Bible predicted in advance the political oppression in Israel, and as reliably predicts conditions of justice and lasting peace soon to come to earth through the blessings of God’s kingdom, which will forever turn </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> the rascals out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The War of Confusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It will probably continue to be called simply the &quot;Korean War”, but &quot;U.N. War I”, the &quot;Chinese-American War”, or even the &quot;War of Confusion” would be as appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One week in March the communists fiercely held their positions, the next they were gone, their guns deserted, their equipment abandoned and a alienee spread over the battlefield (3/13). U. N. forces slowly moved forward, met no opposition when they walked Into the former queen city of Korea, the shell-battered, bumed-out hulk of Seoul, the fourth time the city had changed hands in just one war. Why Mao pulled his forces back was an unanswered question that only added to the confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With the U. N. line approaching the 38th parallel came the question again, should the line be crossed? General Ridgway said (3/12) it would be a &quot;tremendous victory If the war could end with U. N. troops at the 38th parallel”, but MacArthur warned (3/15) that it would take as many troops to hold the line there as to </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">push </span><span class="font12">to the Yalu river and hold it at the Manchurian border. With these questions still unsettled the war of confusion con tinned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">World War m Preparations</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Both the Eastern and West* em campa are trying to stay ahead of the other in arming, and the world grows increasingly more fearful of a third world war. In Russia it was announced (3/7) that military spending would be increased almost 20 per cent this year. Britain’s defense budget has been pushed up from £715 million pre-Korea to over £1,026 million. Australia’s prime minister said (3/2) Australia must add 118,000 men to her services and increase her expenditure on equipment from £84 million to more than £300 million. In the U. S.<sub>t</sub> President Truman signed (3/11) the authorization for 173 new warships and modernization of 291 others, costing 52 billion, This Includes a new super aircraft carrier for use with the A-bomb, snorkel submarines, and rocket launching ships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">General Eisenhower said he would use the A-bomb 'Instantly” If war came, and he was convinced it would bring sufficient destruction to an enemy. India’s Prime Minister Nehru thinks an atom war would affect one billion of earth’s over two billion inhabitants, and Dr. Vannevar Bush, president of Carnegie Institution, said (3/4) that the A-bomb could wreck the Soviet, if she started a war now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Europe Eisenhower's headquarters for the North Atlantic Pact army, “Shape” (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe), were being set up in March, and the U. S. congressional debate against sending U. S. divisions to Europe had apparently died out. Fearing war, Tito said (3/11) Yugoslavia would not be taken by surprise. Reports from Germany indicated Russia was building up her forces, but was not rushing preparations for a swoop on Europe in 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Slave lAbor</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt;£&gt; &quot;Forced labor&quot; was the charge 0/15) In the U. N. Economic and Social Council in Santiago, Chile. The U. S. accused the Soviet Union of using millions of slave laborers as an essential part of Soviet economy. A communist representative retorted that forced labor also exists in other parts of the world, in Nigeria, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Southern Rhodesia, Uganda, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Whether all these charges are true or not, many parts of the world have such abject poverty that it makes a farce out of this world’s claims of justice and equality. The U, N. unit voted (3/19) for a worldwide inquiry into forced labor, but refused to study the working conditions of other poverty-stricken peoples. The dire need for reform cries out, but few ears heed it. An Indian Minis tiy of Labor survey described the usual farm worker in one area as earning the equivalent of less than 20 cents a day, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">12 cents of which goes </span><span class="font12">for food for an average family of five. The New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font12">showed (3/18) an appalling 46 per cent of the world’s population living in &quot;underdeveloped areas”, and it said that while the average annual income per person is 51,453 In the U.S., It is $473 in West Europe, $152 in Latin America, $118 in Africa, $89 in the Middle East, $55 in South Asia and only $30 in Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In contrast with this, note how Isaiah 65:17-25 shows that under the blessings of God’s kingdom each man will have his own possessions, slave labor will be abolished forever, poverty will not exist and man’s labor will not be in vain, but he will long enjoy the work of his hands. Neither democratic nor communistic lands can promise such conditions, so look to God’s kingdom as the sole hope, for suffering mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Communists Fulfill Prophecy </span><span class="font12">$&gt; Jesus gave his disciples many signs showing when he would establish his kingdom. One was, &quot;You will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.” (Matthew 24:9, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font12"> Abundant evidence of this hatred has been given in previous Awake/ issues, but from Poland comes an additional example. In Warsaw seven of Jehovah’s witnesses were sentenced (3/22)to from 5 years to life by a military court, on the ridiculous charges of conducting anti-communist espionage, propaganda for the United States and currency speculation. All Informed persons know that such charges are false, because Jehovah's witnesses meddle not in politics, working only for God’s kingdom. Yet the communists have again added themselves th those who 'frame mischief by law’ against God’s servants.—Psalm </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">94:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">African Badal Issue Boils</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">® Africa's delicate racial is* </span><span class="font12">sues boil continually. In the Rhodesias and Nyasaland nearly 6 million Negroes are ruled by 150,000 whites. In Nyasaland alone the whites are outnumbered 800 to 1. The Union of South Africa (where the apartheid plan segregates the Negro, Indian and white population) has definitely rejected U. N, recommendatlonB for talks on the racial issue, saying that this is purely a local matter. In some African countries there has been considerable development in local self-government by the natives under British training, such as in the Gold Coast which recently held its first elections and installed a predominantly African cabinet. The advancement of self-government has encouraged native nationalists, but European colonists,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">so few Ln number in compert-son with the native population, are afraid of being swamped by it. British policy has taken the view that native interests should take precedence over that of the colonists, Yet no solution is in sight and Africa’s racial issues continue to bolL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">New Tactics Against Huhs</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many fruitless a t te m p t s have been made to conquer the Hukbalahap menace to life and peace in the Philippines, and yet 15,000 communist-led Huks remain. They are mostly poverty-stricken, landless peasants, led into rebellion by false communist promises of justice. A new plan gives every Huk who is captured or surrenders </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">IQ</span><span class="font12"> hectares (25 acres) of land on Mindanao, plus work ant* mals, a house and tools. During six weeks 500 Huks surrendered and applied for resettlement in the promised &quot;green valley Where they can have their own homes and live happily&quot;. Communism thrives on poverty, but it fails to produce the promised results. The Huks would And far greater blessings than the 10 hectares of land promised by the Philippines If. they would look to the Bible and learn of the blessings for this earth under God's righteous kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Tibet Gets Peace Terms</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Tibet has for centuries been considered a part of China, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">although it</span><span class="font12"> has </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">had internal </span><span class="font12">religious self-rule. The Chinese Beds invaded Tibet about October 25, and, as Tibet had little with which to fight, not a single real battle occurred- The war was reported settled in early March when the Chinese guaranteed the Dalai Lama (religious and temporal ruier of the land) the right to conduct the internal government, and let the monks retain absolute authority and privileges of taxation over the 5 million inhabitants v In return thft conquering Reds got the control of Tibetan foreign affairs and the right to garrison Tibet's frontiers, saying they wanted “to protect Chinese territorial integrity'’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Nature's Fury—Ood's Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The power of nature was illustrated in New York when two houses were deposited on state park property by high winds and water last November, They had been blown sufficiently far that by March the owners still had not been found. Often rnan Is impressed with his insignificance by such examples of nature's fury, yet nature’s power </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">1b</span><span class="font12"> tar surpassed by that of the Creator who can hold all earth’s waters as in the palm of his hand.

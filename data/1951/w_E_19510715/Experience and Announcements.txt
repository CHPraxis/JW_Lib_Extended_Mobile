Experience and Announcements
Quebec City
Sister Saumur was in a house talking to a householder about the Scriptures. Someone nearby had phoned the police and a big bully in uniform came striding into the house and ordered the sister to leave right away, saying she was a communist. The householder was amazed at such tactics. The policeman continued his domineering attitude and instructed the sister to get out of the house. However, Sister Saumur said she was going to phone the mayor. But he rushed to the phone, saying: “No you don’t; I’ll phone the mayor,” and he did. She overheard the conversation, which clearly indicated the policeman was getting a dressing down and was being told to leave her there so long as she was not distributing literature. During this time the policeman was saying, “But she’s a communist!” Finally he left the house and was met in the street by a crowd of people who were waiting to see if he brought the sister out with him. It so happens that this policeman is not liked in the district at all, so the crowd began to laugh at him and kept calling out: “Where is she? Can’t you get her? What’s the matter with you?” They were getting after him because of their dislike for his tactics.

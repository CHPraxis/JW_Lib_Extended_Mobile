<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 1, 2. What other prophetic utterances point to the fact that the Lord’s people must enter into still more fulfillment of prophecies following the 1,335 days?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb">THOUGH the above portion of Daniel’s prophecy is realized, yet it is not the end, for Jehovah and His King are determined to deliver ‘all the children of his people’. Every one of God’s children will be brought to the beloved city; some already having been brought back are now ready for Kingdom service. So that we may learn the progressive purposes of God beyond the 1,335 days we connect Daniel’s prophecy with John’s vision at Revelation, and note that it takes us beyond the time spoken of by Daniel. With this in mind we now refer to Daniel’s vision of the angel standing on the water. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:5-27:12:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 12:5-7</a>) This same angel is also seen in vision recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:5-27:10:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 10:5-7</a>, <em>AS: </em>“I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz: his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.” This angel is identified for us as the Lord Jesus Christ in glory at the time of his kingdom: “And in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man, clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the breasts with a golden girdle. Moreover, his head and his hair were white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a fiery flame, and his feet were like fine copper when glowing in a furnace, and his voice was as the sound of many waters. And when I saw him, I fell as dead at his <span id="page439" class="pageNum" data-no="439" data-before-text="439"></span>feet. And he laid his right hand upon me and said: ‘Do not be fearful. I am the First and the Last, and the living one; and I became dead, but, look! I am living for ever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:13-66:1:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 1:13-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:17-66:1:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:13-27:10:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13</a> we see the great Prince Michael (Christ) coming to the rescue of one of the heavenly messengers, further establishing the fact that Christ Jesus is prophetically spoken of as the one who is over the great waters (multitudes). “Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:5-27:12:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 12:5</a>, <em>AS</em>) Here are many waters or a flood (great multitude), with one angel at one extremity and another at the other extremity, for they are on the edges of opposite banks. This obviously brings in all the multitudes, and inquiry is made. ‘How long to the end of these wonders?’ The glorious King Christ Jesus lifts up his right hand, which is in the nature of an oath; as when “Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:22-1:14:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 14:22</a>, <em>AS; </em>also see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:40-5:32:40" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>.) Turning now to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:5-66:10:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 10:5-7</a>, <em>NW: </em>“And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, and by the One who lives for ever and ever, . . . he swore: ‘There will be no delay any longer; but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he is destined to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.’” Here is the solemn declaration that there will not be any more waiting. The sacred secret of God is finished. This prophecy of finishing the sacred secret of God receives its fulfillment after 1926, following the 1,335 days, during the time of blessedness.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>SACRED SECRET OF GOD</strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 3. What questions have been cleared up for the Lord’s servants only since the year 1926?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Can you appreciate it is only about twenty-five years since the glorious and holy name of Jehovah was brought to the fore, and revealed to God’s people as a name which should be published in every part of the earth? Also do you know that until 1926 the name was seldom used even in gatherings of God’s people, and never in connection with the public ministry? That people of the world had difficulty in understanding what was meant by the designation of “Jehovah’s witnesses” first publicly proclaimed in 1931? That among the Lord’s people there were many puzzling questions such as, Why all these crimes and calamities? What is the reason for the persecution upon the children of God? Now that the Kingdom had come, why wars, and what was the position of the rulers of this world? Was God noting these things? When would he take action?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. What questions are still being asked by those outside the Lord’s organization, bringing what responsibility to His servants?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Now these questions are no longer puzzling to the children of Jehovah. “All thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 54:13</a>, <em>AS</em>) However, those outside the organization of Jehovah are questioning these matters and require information. Only those inside know, and therefore they are the ones to dispense the knowledge to those outside. They do ask, Who is God? Can he be responsible for all these terrible disasters? Does he authorize the false religionists to speak for him? Does he appoint wicked dictators? Has he an organization? Does he have just one people, or hundreds of different organizations? Is he a fiend, a monster, a god of blood? Why do the wicked prosper? Is God righteous, <span id="page440" class="pageNum" data-no="440" data-before-text="440"></span>pure and holy? Why is Satan permitted to fight God? Question after question is asked about God by those outside. Does it not make the hearts of God’s faithful people continually happy to know the truth? for to them ‘the sacred secret of God is finished’. They are in the time of blessedness.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5, 6. How can it be truly said today that ‘there shall be delay no longer’?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The day is not far distant, it will now not be delayed any longer, when Jehovah will rise up to punish the wicked nations of earth and so make a name for himself that will be remembered forevermore. Thirty-five hundred years ago he destroyed the Egyptians in the Red sea and more than four thousand years ago he brought the great Flood and destroyed a world. His name is still associated with these wonderful works. However, after Armageddon his name will be remembered forever. That time of deliverance for the meek, the faithful ones, is very close, and its information is being published as good news to them. “The sacred secret of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:7-66:10:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 10:7</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>All Jehovah’s witnesses and companions know we are living in grand and glorious days, because the time is here for the realization of every vision. No longer are they postponed. This truly is the day which Jehovah has arranged, the time for the realization of his marvelous promises. Let us as the witnesses of Jehovah fully enter into it and take our stand amid the inhabitants of the earth as those who belong to Jehovah’s city, and to the new system of things, as those who know that the Kingdom is established in heaven and Jehovah reigns. Live then in this knowledge and be as those who are wise and who turn thousands to the ways of righteousness, yes, into the new world.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7. What fact relating to judgment and deliverance would the peoples of earth do well to now carefully note?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>At this eventful time the seventh angel blows his trumpet, that is, after the 1,260 days ended in 1918. Then it is that these wonders can come to pass. “And the seventh angel blew his trumpet. And loud voices occurred in heaven saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.’ And the twenty-four persons of advanced age who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces and worshiped God, saying: ‘We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.’ And the temple sanctuary of God that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary. And there occurred lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-19</a>, <em>NW</em>) Is it not so very clear to God’s children how now the many waters, that is, the peoples, the nations, the tongues, have all come under Christ Jesus? The quicker people recognize this fact, the better it will be for them. This is a day of <span id="page441" class="pageNum" data-no="441" data-before-text="441"></span>judgment. It is a day of deliverance. Some know enough of the truth to fight it because it brings responsibilities, but this is taking a very unwise course, since Jehovah offers nothing else. Where else can you go, for Christ Jesus is in control and God makes known his will through his faithful Servant, and that will is the word of life.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. What dividing work is now therefore being accomplished?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Multitudes of honest persons are to turn toward the new world and the righteous King, and those who do so find peace and happiness even now amidst the old wicked world. But the “wicked shall do wickedly”, and their hatred for the children of the Most High increases. They know they have no part with the revelations, favors and privileges of the Kingdom, and they see that Jehovah has brought these wonders to pass in our midst, inside the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. The great, long-standing and marvelous prophecies have been fulfilled in us. Therefore with an unmistakable identity Jehovah’s witnesses are being pointed to by Jehovah’s Word and the facts in modern fulfillment thereof. They are his beloved ones. The wicked know this and see themselves cast out, and so wail and gnash their teeth in chagrin.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9. What strange identification work goes grandly on year by year, suggesting what sober questions on the part of those who are not following the wise course?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Jehovah’s remarkable, strange work of identifying his faithful servant does not stop. Year after year it becomes more evident. Visions and prophecies are coming to pass through the wonderful things Jehovah is doing for us. “Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:126:2-19:126:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 126:2</a>, <em>AS</em>) No one else has been chosen of all the organizations of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are for signs and wonders in the land. “Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in Mount Zion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:16-23:8:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 8:16-18</a>, <em>AS</em>) Those who profess to love God and claim to be doing his will and are not serving and worshiping with those who know the new world is at hand would be wise to consider their position quickly. If these would simply ask themselves one or two simple questions: Am I conscious of Jehovah’s favor upon the work that I am doing? Do I expect judgment from him as a result of the service being performed, and can I prove from His holy Word that my works are in obedience thereto? Or am I performing some service selfishly? Is it for my own praise or Jehovah’s? Am I learning more about God’s kingdom and its establishment? Can I appreciate the fulfillment of prophecy? If you are still in mystic Babylon, then consider the truths set before you and make haste to leave the condemned organization. “And I heard another voice out of heaven say: ‘Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. What experiences of the Lord’s servants, particularly from 1933 on, demonstrate the intensifying of the Devil’s campaign against them?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The forces of this evil system of things which are to pass away will make repeated attacks upon the Lord’s people, but they will never break and scatter them. Satan knows Jehovah’s witnesses are God’s people and the only ones on earth standing for Jehovah’s praise and proclaiming the kingdom of the Lord Jesus, and he will raise the whole world against this people to destroy them, but he will not accomplish <span id="page442" class="pageNum" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>this devilish plot, for “the power of the disperser of the holy people” is broken. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:7-27:12:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 12:7</a>, <em>Ro, </em>margin) His opposition and persecution have increased, greater by far than 1914 to 1918. It was intensified from 1933 until the second world war broke out, which provided an opportunity for enemies of Zion to rush at us in a great offensive. This attack was terrific, for all parts of the organization were besieged, but the organization of God took the shock, reeled only momentarily under the world pressure, but the stronghold of Zion stood fast. Satan the ruler of the opposition hordes forcibly took some brothers into his prisons and concentration camps, some he put to death, while on thousands of others he brought privation and much mental as well as physical suffering. But with what result?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>EVIDENCE OF RELEASE</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11-13. What were the results of this devilish campaign, and how testified to by the <em>Watchtower </em>issues of 1942?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Certainly the “continual sacrifice” was this time not taken away, for praise was offered daily, yes hourly, some of the faithful even honoring Jehovah with their life’s blood. God’s people were strengthened with ‘food convenient’, for right in the midst of that terrible destructive World War II the Lord spread a rich table of Kingdom truths. <em>The Watchtower </em>published during this period such wonderful, strengthening and heart-cheering articles as “Defeat of Persecution” (issue of July 15, 1942), “Fighter for the New World” (in five parts contained in issues October 15 to December 15, 1942, inclusive), “Micah” (in eleven parts, January 1 to June 15, 1942, inclusive), “Song-Call to Action” (July 1, 1942), and many more. Not only was Zion fed “with the finest of wheat” but companionship in convention was provided. Jehovah’s people were set, they were sure, they were steadfast, as evident by the resolution adopted at the Cleveland convention:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“ . . . THAT we are opposed to all totalitarian rule and its limitation of the worship of Jehovah God through Jesus Christ. We owe allegiance to no foreign power, religious or political, but our Head and Leader is the One of God’s choice and designation, Christ Jesus the King, whose example we will follow in the worship and service of God. Come what the Lord may permit, we will continue to worship Jehovah God and to resist all demonized encroachments upon His worship and service, and to fight on in indissoluble unity until He gives the victory through his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">“Dated, Saturday, September 19, 1942.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Also of interest were letters sent in from branches and companies in the field, such as the one quoted in the October 1, 1942, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>from London:</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">“We thank the Lord for the continued stimulating truths so abundantly provided through <em>The Watchtower</em>. We will prove our faith in The Theocracy by our works. We refuse to break our covenant vows. The ‘abomination of desolation’ can never take away from us the joy of praising Jehovah’s name. Doubtless many dark days are ahead. The people of good-will look to Jehovah’s witnesses for comfort. We cannot forsake them. We seek to be diligent and obey the Lord’s invitation ‘Feed my sheep’. We declare our determination to use every possible opportunity NOW to do this work. We will stand blameless.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“As a city compact together we face with full confidence in the Lord the threatening Assyrian entry into the land of Jehovah. Victory lies with The Theocracy, the Holy City. Come what may, we are ready and willing to bear whatever reproaches and persecution the Lord may permit to the vindication of his name.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page443" class="pageNum" data-no="443" data-before-text="443"></span><sup>13 </sup>Then in 1943, 1944, and in 1945 from Jehovah’s people the same “sacrifice of praise” was still ascending. How true that Satan could not now remove the continual sacrifice as he did in 1918! The Lord was in our midst and, though all nations battled at our gates and tried to break down integrity, Zion’s children stood faithful.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">14, 15. Contrary to natural expectations, what has been the condition of His servants since World War II?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Now what has taken place since World War II? Blessedness has increased and greater light has been shed upon God’s Word. Knowledge has been granted. The righteous coming out from the heavy times of persecution and suffering and bans and other forms of opposition were like the sun shining its way through clouds. Now in all brilliance the message of the truth powerfully penetrates all the faraway places, for no place seems hidden from the sunshine of the truth. One would expect in a natural way that after all the hardships and prison experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses they would be worn out and weary and in such a condition not able to go forward now with God’s work in the postwar period.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Remember the great international assembly in New York in 1950? Were those witnesses there like that? To the contrary! They were vigorous, full of burning zeal for truth, eager for every opportunity of service. There were no complainers, no grumblers or discontented ones of the witnesses here. No, for these thousands were at peace and full of joy, and their very faces and conversation expressed happiness. Yet these were the ones who had been so hard pressed by Satan. Satan is no conqueror; his power is broken, all he can do now is scrape together the remnant of the Gentile powers and hold them the best way he can until the strong arm of Jehovah destroys them utterly.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">16. What particular expressions of the prophecies can now be seen to be filled with marvelous meaning to the Lord’s people?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Oh, how fitting and full of meaning to these witnesses are the psalmist’s words: “When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, we were like unto them that dream. Jehovah hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.” “If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, let Israel now say, If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, when men rose up against us; . . . Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.” “They that trust in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Jehovah is round about his people from this time forth and for evermore. For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.” “Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:126:1-19:126:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 126:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:126:3-19:126:3" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:126:5-19:126:6" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:124:1-19:124:6" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 124:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:124:8-19:124:8" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:125:1-19:125:3" data-bid="16-6" class="b"> 125:1-3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:1-23:52:1" data-bid="16-7" class="b"> Isa. 52:1</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">17. How did the New York Assembly in 1950 signalize a truly blessed condition into which the Lord’s people had now been ushered?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>The captives home! Thousands upon thousands, all back! Who would have dreamed in 1919 that Jehovah would cause all these to flock to his city? What an increase! In gratitude his people assembled at New York in 1950 to celebrate “Theocracy’s increase”. And what a celebration! See what was happening, for there at this <span id="page444" class="pageNum" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span>the greatest and most important city of this world the people were witnessing the saints of the Most High God and their faithful companions in sweet fellowship, basking in the sunshine of Jehovah’s love and care. These children of God whom this world had tried to destroy and cause to be no more, out from the prisons, the concentration camps, the fiery times of persecution, walking about in peace and serenity, with God’s blessing upon them. “Behold, my servant [Christ Jesus], whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.” “Out of Zion shall go forth the law, . . . And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, . . . nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 42:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:3-23:2:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">18. Why do we understand that the Lord’s servants yet have unprecedented privileges before them in the days that lie ahead?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>“It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:6-23:49:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 49:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) “So shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:15-23:52:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 52:15</a>, <em>AS</em>) Yes, God’s Servant Christ Jesus in a place of great favor and exalted as the teacher of the nations by his faithful followers on earth. Note <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:52:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:13</a>, <em>AS: </em>“Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.” Certainly there is yet much work for God’s faithful servants under Christ Jesus to perform, a work among the nations such as has never been seen before. Before the work is over they will direct many more persons into Zion, yes, possibly millions! Zion’s day is here. The king of Zion will work through his visible organization, his “faithful and discreet slave”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>, <em>NW</em>) All his commands will be given that way.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">19. What important truths should be diligently studied and grasped by those who now read and understand the meaning of the “days” of Daniel?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The day of deliverance is here. After having considered some of the prophecies recorded by Daniel, and having understood the meaning of the 1,260, 1,290 and 1,335 days, do not “despise the day of small things”. But knowing these things, realize that the organization producing proofs of fulfillments of prophecies in and through them must be Jehovah’s people. God causes his word to come to pass, and he reveals his sacred secrets to whomsoever he wishes. Grasp the importance of these fulfilled visions, realize their import, know that we are in the day of prosperity and the time of blessedness is here. God’s Servant is revealed to the nations by His witnesses on earth, and that Servant will have to be recognized before God’s favor will be granted them. There is no other way of obtaining a knowledge of the truth. “Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples,” says Jehovah’s great Servant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:16-23:8:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 8:16</a>, <em>AS</em>) Do not despise the instrument God uses; consider first the message of importance the theocratic organization brings and the proofs which are offered.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Children of Zion, your King is here. He dwells in the midst of the city. Today is no time for waiting and inactivity. The city will be the joy of the whole earth. No city compares with her, “beautiful for situation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:48:2-19:48:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 48:2</a>) Fling wide open the gates, welcome with warmth the returning captives, offer them the hospitality of the city. Sing so loud and harmoniously <span id="page445" class="pageNum" data-no="445" data-before-text="445"></span>that it will be heard by those yet prisoners and give them heart and good cheer. Let them hear the good news they have longed for. Shout out, and let others know Jehovah reigns, for to this call many will yet respond. Blow the trumpet for the sleepy ones to awaken. Sound the notes for the marching, returning captives to sing as they come from mystic Babylon to Zion, out of captivity and into freedom, out of darkness into light. “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:6-66:19:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 19:6</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

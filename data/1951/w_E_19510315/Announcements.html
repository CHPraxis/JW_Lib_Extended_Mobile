<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“DROOP NOT YOUR HANDS” TESTIMONY PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This is the Testimony Period for the month of April. It was an encouraging command first uttered by the prophet Zephaniah to a people bearing the name of Jehovah and doing a work of praise. Today, as then, there is a people doing a like work of praising their Creator. This work is publishing the Kingdom message, “a pure language,” to all nations before the world’s destruction at Armageddon. All Bible prophecy calls for fearless action in this work, “Fear not, droop not your hands.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:16-36:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:16</a>, Mo) Do you want to put your hands to this work? If so, a ready implement is at hand; offer the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine subscription to others for $1 a year. To new subscribers during the month the booklets <em>Evolution versus The New World, Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth? </em>and one other will be given free.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>DEFENDING AND LEGALLY ESTABLISHING THE GOOD NEWS</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The record of the fight by Jehovah’s witnesses to maintain freedom for true worship is well known to all. Their legal battles in the courts during the past years have resulted in many victories not only in their own behalf but for the benefit of all citizens to exercise their civil rights, and to establish as law the right to worship and preach as God has commanded. How these liberties have been defended, established and written into the law of the land is made clear in the 96-page booklet <em>Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News</em>. It will be sent on a 10c contribution.</p>

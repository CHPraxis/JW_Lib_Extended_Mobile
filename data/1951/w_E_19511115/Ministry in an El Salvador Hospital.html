<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Bible instruction has carried Jehovah’s witnesses into strange places in their efforts to reach all people. Take, for example, the case of the Bible study in the general hospital of San Salvador, the capital. It has now been conducted for over a year and the original small group has grown many times. These men, confined to the tuberculosis ward for an unknown length of time, have occupied themselves in the ministry work in spite of the most unfavorable circumstances. Some of the more active convalescents who have become Jehovah’s witnesses conduct regular Bible studies with other interested patients, thus working from bedside to bedside. They spend their out-of-bed time effectively preaching the good news, and they report their activity to the local congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. This month, April, witnessed the establishment of a theocratic ministry school in the hospital ward. Now they will have the benefit of an effective ministerial training course.</p>

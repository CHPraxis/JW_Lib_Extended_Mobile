<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Are you one of those Jesus mentioned in the illustration of the sower who produces fruit in abundance? If you are, it means life in the new world for you. The seed, God’s Word of truth, sown in a good heart is like a seed sown in good soil, as it is written, “As for the one sown upon the right kind of soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>, <em>NW</em>) Those who receive this seed and use it in the proper way spread the life-giving Word. This work of planting seed and cultivating the soil is being engaged in by Jehovah’s witnesses, and during the month of November they will plant seed by offering to everyone three bound books on a contribution of $1. You may share in bearing fruit manyfold by taking part in this activity. Why not write in to us, or attend the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses in your vicinity, and learn how you may share in this fruitful work of preaching his Word and kingdom?</p>

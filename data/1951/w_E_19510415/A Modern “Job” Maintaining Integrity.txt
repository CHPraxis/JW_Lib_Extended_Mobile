A Modern “Job” Maintaining Integrity
● About six years ago my wife and children started studying the Watchtower publications. At that time I had to go to the hospital for an operation, having cancer of the face. About three years ago I began to take an interest too. I know now that everything happens for good to them that love the Lord. While I was in the hospital this past year I tried to turn my remaining time to profit, as instructed at Luke 9:23. Some of the patients and nurses called me preacher and some called me Job. Job having been a preacher of righteousness, I felt honored in all my suffering to be put by them in his class. I have had 49 operations, losing my right eye, nose, roof of mouth, upper gums, teeth, lip, in fact, nearly all of my face is gone. On April 18, 1950, I was released from the Veteran’s Hospital near Atlanta, Georgia, a well man. I have a new face—plastic. I feel like it will last until Jehovah sees fit to make me another one. All the praise goes to him. As for me and my house, we will praise Him yet more and more.—M. H., Alabama.

Surprise from a Clergyman
● This morning I was preaching the gospel from house to house in a blizzard. At the third door I was able to place a Bible study aid. Returning down the street, the lady who had taken the book came out and said that her vicar had just arrived and would I come in? Now for it, I thought! But to my surprise he gave me a real welcome and said that he had just looked through the book I had left with the lady and was greatly impressed by the title and the numerous Scripture citations. He said moreover, “I admire you people who come in all weathers in order to do this work, and the more I read about you, the more I feel the uselessness of material things and the need of God’s kingdom.” He concluded by asking, “What books have you got for me in your bag?” The result was that I was able to obtain subscriptions for both The Watchtower and the Awake! magazine with very little effort.—J.

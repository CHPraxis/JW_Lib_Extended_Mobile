<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Regardless of how strange a foreign land and tongue may seem to a missionary, the Lord’s blessing will be upon sincere efforts, as the following experience from Peru clearly shows: “Breaking the ground in brand-new territory with a brand-new language, I thought I’d never live through my first day trying to preach the gospel in the Spanish language. But I did, and a happy surprise was awaiting me just around the corner. While knocking at a door during our second day of work here I said a little prayer and hoped that these poor people would get something out of the testimony that I must give in very poor Spanish. At this home the mother and daughter showed a great deal of interest, especially when they were shown from the Bible the real meaning of ‘hell’, the condition of the dead, etc., and a home Bible study was arranged for the following week. Imagine my surprise when I went back and found not just two people but ten ready to study. This study has continued without interruption ever since, and at times as many as thirteen have attended at one time. After three months of study and association with this dear family five became active preachers of the gospel and some of the others will join shortly. Much to our joy, several others in this neighborhood have become active Kingdom publishers too, and now this home is a regular assembly point where groups of ministers gather for gospel-preaching activity.”</p>

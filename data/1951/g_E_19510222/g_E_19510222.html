<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font29"><a name="bookmark16"></a>DOLLARS FOR DICTATORS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">I</span><span class="font2">N 1940 the world faced the threat of Nazi and Fascist totalitarianism. World War H resulted. In 1950 the world faced the threat of Communist totalitarianism, and in one of the Inconsistencies of world politics the democracies were being pushed into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">encouraging</span><span class="font2"> the fascism that they had fought during the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Spain’s Fascist dictator, Francisco Franco, was granted a $62,500,000 loan by the U.S. Congress (August 28). Spain was brought into favor in the U. N. October 31. Yet about the same time (October .7) a division of the U. S. State Department published a 951-page volume on “Germany and the Spanish Civil War”, laying bare the part played by Nazi and Fascist interventionists in overthrowing the Spanish republic and establishing Franco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The documents indicate that planes, guns, Italian divisions, and the German Condor Legion were poured into Spain. This cost Hitler $200 million. It cost Italy 1,000 planes, 6,000 lives and 14 billion lire. Without German and Italian help, the documents show, Franco’s cause might have been lost on several occasions. It was franco’s collaboration with Hitler and Mussolini that prompted the U. N. to resolve, in 1946, to withdraw ambassadors from Madrid and bar Spain in the U. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But since that time powerful influences have been at work. Attitudes began to change. In January, 1950, Secretary of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">State Dean Acheson said that withdrawal of the ambassador to Spain was a mistake, and the U. S. delegation in the U. N. opened a feverish campaign to have the General Assembly revoke its resolution against Franco’s Fascist government. The U. N. ban against Spain was revoked November 4. President Truman said shortly thereafter that it would be a long, long time before the U. S. sent an ambassador to that country, but then he too changed his mind and on December#27 it was announced that Stanton Griffis had been appointed as the new ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Agitation in the U. S. Congress to give Spain $100 million (Hitler had gone further, with $200 million) was first rejected, but then congressmen began to change their minds, and finally $62,500,000 was granted to the dictator. President Truman first impounded the money, but then changed his mind on this, too, and granted the gift to Franco. What powerful Influence got behind Acheson and Congress and Truman? What prompted them to believe that supporting Fascist totalitarianism would help fight communist totalitarianism? Senator Morse admitted that a ‘‘powerful lobby” engineered the Spanish loan. (New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times^</span><span class="font2"> August 2, 1950) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's</span><span class="font2"> magazine commented editorially (March 25, 1950) : “Generalissimo Francisco Franco . . , has got quite a corps of unofficial press agents in this country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Obviously Spain’s chief press agent, although Senator Morse and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collier’s</span><span class="font1"> chose to omit identifying it, is the church that Franco has served so well; severely restricting all other forms of worship, and making it the state religion. Anything that helps Franco helps his church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do you doubt that a religious organization would exert such pressure? Then let Walter Trohan, writing in the Chicago </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font1"> (February 19,1950), remove that doubt. He said that particularly during the last ten years political pressure from religious groups has been felt in Washington. He explained that in the early part of 1950 President Truman grumbled to a Republican senator that Catholics and Jews were exerting pressure to enforce /their political beliefs, and then said, “Recognition of Spain is at present one of the main political aims of Catholics. ... In recent weeks the State Department has been shifting toward the Catholic view on Spain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But let that church convict itself. The London </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font1"> (October 6,1950) attempted to convince its readers that the rebirth of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">militant</span><span class="font1"> Spain “is the one great positive development of the 20th century”, and that, had it not been for Franco’s rise to power, Spain would be an integral part of the Soviet military empire. It claimed that “the exclusion of Spain . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">deprives </span><span class="font1">Europe of her chief base, and of the moral and spiritual influence of the most Catholic country in Europe”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Putting Spain up as the “one great positive development of the 20th century” does not say much for the century! If Spain's totalitarianism is a “moral and spiritual influence”, then the world should shudder with sheer horror at the thought of an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">immoral</span><span class="font1"> influence!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That Franco’s publicity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">agents are </span><span class="font1">Rome-directed is evident from the general Catholic attitude. Roman Catholic Latin-American countries sponsored the withdrawal of the U. N. ban on Franco. The British ambassador to. Spain in 1939-40, Sir Maurice Peterson, spoke of “English Anglo-Catholics who saw in Franco a saviour of Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Belgium had a Protestant majority in Parliament when, in 1946, it proposed the U. N. resolution to withdraw ambassadors from Spain, It had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a Catholic majority </span><span class="font1">when, in 1950, it voted in favor of Spain in the U. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the need of developing Spain’s friendship to gain military bases, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collier’s </span><span class="font1">editor commented, “The democratic allies won two wars in Europe without the aid of Spanish arms or Spanish hospitality. We cannot believe that victory or defeat in another war would hinge on either of those factors. . . . We cannot forget that Franco is the creature and protege of Mussolini and Hitler and that, as such, he is the symbol of an evil which some people seem to have forgotten.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1940 Hitler said that without Italian and German aid “Franco would not exist today”. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hitler no longer gives</span><span class="font1"> that aid. Will the day come when historians will say that without U. S. friendship find aid “Franco would not exist today”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lovers of freedom in Spain now feel that the democracies have deserted them to fascism. But they should not despair. They have only proved again the truth of the psalmist’s words, “Put not your trust in princes ... in whom there is no help,” but, “Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.” (Psalm 146:3-5) The one who has Jehovah for his help does not fret over man’s political blunders, for he knows that God’s kingdom will soon bring a righteous government and blessings to the earth. Then no totalitarian governments of any kind will exist anywhere. Their oppression of the people will then be a thing of the past.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">R</span><span class="font1">EASON deserts a man gone mad. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, is the same with a world. Unthought-of things become obsessions; unnatural acts commonplace. Staggered to the knees by total wars, flattened by disease and famine, modern society next finds its wounds infected with the death-dealing.gangrene of sex madness. Forsaken by common sense and captured by empty sophistication, man answers the multiplying bizarre sex crimes by pulling sex out from every dark corner and illuminating it in a blinding glare. The world is fed sex through the eyes, ears, nose, throat and veins until at last rational persons are fed up. Still, sex lunacy zooms, crimes spiral upward and man sinks in the mire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Can this happen to a twentieth-century “brain age”? Now that the “brain age” is almost dead because of it,_we only waste time with such a query. In their zeal to punish the stork for ever letting the Victorians of two generations ago make that noble and unsuspecting bird a substitute for normal motherhood, the modems have swung the pendulum completely back to the frank, free and open era of the Caesars. In those “good old days” sex was a classical pastime, an indoor sport. Yet at its worst that society was a mere neighborhood scandal compared with today’s global attack of promiscuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now the experts have succeeded in convincing many anxious parents that the stork is a cad and a scoundrel, and that they should give their youngsters the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">truth. Well and good, but along comes Junior to ask one short, entirely uninvolved question with no complications. Said Parents’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in May, 1946, “At the first</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">question that shows any sign of interest in sex matters, even in young children, many mothers who have ‘seen the light’ tend to burden their children with all the minute facts of anatomical sex structure,\of the birth processes and of reproduction so that the children are sometimes overwhelmed, frequently bewildered and occasionally bored.” At this rate, it will hot be surprising if Junior soon drops his comic book with a yawn instead of a laugh and, with a cold, analytical gleam in his eye, decides that &quot;Maggie and Jiggs” are incompatible due to sexual maladjustment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Listen to Robert Thomas Allen as he is reported in header’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font1"> for April, 1950 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Uncle Wiggily was coming down the Old Winding Path. Hippity hop! Hippity hop! The sun was shining. The birds were singing. But something was wrong with Uncle Wiggily. Yes, sir! Something was wrong! Uncle Wiggily was sexually maladjusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I haven’t read that yet; but I expect to any day. There’s no reason to suppose that bedtime stories will escape the trend now that sex has found its way into everything else—magazines, newspaper columns, documentary films, advertisements and door-to-door surveys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Don’t get me wrong. I have nothing but respect for the men and women who took sex out of the root cellar. The airing is good. Let’s be frank about sex. Then let’s forget it For one thing, I want to talk about something else . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We’re not only looking at sex frankly, we’re staring at it until we’re cross-eyed. There has been so much written on it that a lot of young people are going to get the idea that married couples never get out of bed. They do. They have to put out the ashes. They have to go </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to work and forget </span><span class="font1">about sex in large stretches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The apparent reason for the current emphasis on sex is the mounting of sex crimes, which, we are told, are chargeable to the general ignorance of the public concerning sex matters. A teen-age boy ambushes, criminally attacks and kills an eleven-year-old girl. Within approximately fifty days, four Los Angeles, California, women are assaulted, beaten and mutilated. A high-school girl fights desperately and narrowly escapes from a knife-armed stranger who had offered her a ride. A sex-mad pastor is convicted of abusing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">young girls under</span><span class="font1"> his charge in a religious orphanage. Perversion cases multiply. A Hollywood doctor has advocated a “Sex Anonymous” club to help movie celebrities straighten out their love lives in the manner that “Alcoholics Anonymous” has assisted the habitual drunkards. In 1946, Los Angeles reported twenty-four sex murders, Chicago, 157 cases </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1">“indecent liberties&quot;, and rape was occurring every forty-five minutes somewhere in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is Ignorance the Cause?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coronet</span><span class="font1"> magazine reported concerning Chicago’s youthful sex marauder, William Heirens: “Dr. Foster Kennedy of Bellevue Hospital, one of a board named by the State of Illinois to investigate the notorious case, said: ‘His mother gave the boy his entire sex education in one sentence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“All sex is dirty; if you touch anyone, you get a disease.” ’ Again and again, parents of sex delinquents voice shock and surprise. Their son was always such a good boy. Why, he had never even been allowed to associate with girls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inference is clear: sex crimes occur largely because of improper sex education. So sex is promptly snatched from cover, made public property and strung out over </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">newspapers, billboards, schoolbooks and </span><span class="font1">every communication source available. But this argument alone simply will not hold water. Surveys by sex education proponents appear to prove that nearly everyone has received either an improper or an incomplete sex training at home. In October, 1948, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> cited a college student’s survey revealing that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">100</span><span class="font1"> per cent of a group of married men interviewed and 83 per cent of a group of ex-soldiers had found their early life sex education inadequate. If their figures and their reasoning matched, one might expect a sex criminal on every corner. No, a twisted, possessed mind and an utter disregard for decency are the prime moving parts in the machine of sex crimes. These factors in the most enlightened sex-wise ones will produce evil. Authorities are proving there is no set pattern for measuring all sex offenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, proper instruction is vital, as doctors </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">can readily show.</span><span class="font1"> But in this sex-drowned world its source is even more important. Reams of reading material are available; but much of it is mere idle chatter by someone wishing to keep in vogue in times when talking sex is smart. Moving pictures keep doing their bit, sexy novels have increased in popularity, even children's comic books have cut </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1"> laughs to accentuate the curves. Advertising has been strangled by the sex octopus. Want to make </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">him</span><span class="font1"> pop the question or guarantee that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font1"> will say ‘yes’? Then just</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">switch to the right hair tohfc or tooth paste and you can’t miss! Amusing? Then sober yourseif with the fact that a believing public makes possible more and more of the same. What do the million and one available examples add up to prove? That the wallowing world is already staggering and gagging on sex. But still more is demanded. Where now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sex Goee to School</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Adequate sex education in schools, even among elementary grade children, is be-tog relentlessly pushed by many educators as a last hope for civilization, Those wishing to keep this function in the home argue that If any training is necessary, let the parents have it so they can aid their own children properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the religious front, the Catholic Church has staunchly opposed carrying *ex etacatton into the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Protestant bodies have largely favored it. hi November, I960, International News Service reported that U. S. Catholic bishops challenged American parents to ‘retain major responsibility for guiding religious vocational and sex education of their children’* Yet this same apparent defender of the home front boasts of its own sex courses in some of Its parochial schools; and, whether parochial or public, many parents have been all too willing to drop their burdens into another lap. They have long done the sajne thing in regard to the “Sunday school”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regardless of whatever may be done by the schools, parents of all or of no religions will wisely ask themselves a few pointed questions: Who but the parent will beat know when his child is ready for each progressive step in this important study? Who but the parent can offer all the needed time and patience and understanding? Who but the parent can leel the necessary love for the child to make him see how this quality must dominate </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">bfotogiM side of life, thus presenting the Instruction in Its true beauty and in its proper reta-tlonshlp to the rest of God’s law as revealed in the Bible? This latter consideration will rank ever uppermost in the minds of all true Christian parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most informed advocates for school sex education usually admit that the home is the EUQerirrc glaca Qt watrocSJjw*, twft. that the school la necessary where parents fad. Quoting the British authority R. Weatherall’s summary of a ministry of education pamphlet, In its December 15, 1945, issue, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">School and Society</span><span class="font2"> said: “Opinion is unanimous, for instance, that the primary duty of giving young children a right and informed attitude toward human reproduction devolves upon the parents. But experience shows that most parents are unable, either on personal grounds or throng'iadk ol adequate &quot;knowledge, properly to fulfill this task; instead, the greater number of them would gladly hand it over to the schools.” But these are markedly treacherous times, and let any who would 'hand over’ this precious parental privilege take heed lest he later have sore regret</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children Threatened by Modernism</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To some it may seem incredible that the child could receive wrong or damaging instruction in school. But recall the subtle stealth with which the faith-destroying doctrine of evolution wormed its way into schoolbooks and out of the mouths of rubber-tongued teachers long before it was an accepted school subject anywhere. Many have similarly lived to regret the sectarian confusion of “three-headed gods”, weird purgatories and horrible hell-fires born of sending children to Sunday school for something the parent later wished he himself had taught. If this has been your experience you will know the harm of neglecting such parental duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today the danger is far more actual than imaginary that improper sex instruction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lurks even</span><span class="font1"> in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">halls of</span><span class="font1"> “higher learning&quot;. Declaims the “modernist” method of combating sex delinquency: ‘If you can’t stop it, approve it.’ Admittedly it is a sure “cure&quot;, just as all crime might be snuffed out overnight by simply legalizing it! While the numerical majority still resist this madness, they find themselves writing and talking </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">feverishly to sustain </span><span class="font1">their ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The American Social Hygiene Association, meeting in the Hotel New Yorker on the first of February, 1950, was treated to the spectacle of hearing promiscuity tacitly championed by a Yale professor of anthropology, George P. Murdock. Professor Murdock bluntly predicted that “within three generations” society would condone premarital sex freedom and consider it an aid in the selection of a proper mate. Shocked? Then how do you like to hear that this met with considerable acclaim, even from some clergymen? True, doctors, religious men, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">biologists and educators </span><span class="font1">who are honest can present no end of proof that physically, morally and mentally there is every advantage to chastity and continence. But the raw fact remains that they are all talking and talking loudly these days ini an effort to convince a wayward world that what was formerly taken for granted is really true. The tide is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">strong </span><span class="font1">in the way of ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other hard-to-face facts reek with evidence that the “brain age” of enlightenment has not succeeded where others supposedly failed. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collier’s</span><span class="font1"> advertised an article in November, 1948, by calling attention to the fact that 50,000 babies had been born illegitimately to girls of high-school age during the previous year. In England, an education official charged that eleven-and twelve-year-old boys and girls were putting into active practice what they learned about sex in the classroom. In answer to the claim that places where organized sex education is carried on are lowering school-age pregnancies, Presbyterian educator Charles R. Proudfit counters that instead he is informed the &quot;education” has merely better acquainted the delinquents with knowledge of effective safeguards and contraceptives. There is hardly any misconstruing the high-school class in hygiene that, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">given its choice of topics for open </span><span class="font1">discussion, selected, “How to have sexual intercourse without risking pregnancy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The True Cause and Right Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not forget that modem society, which hears more about sex than any previous generation, is the worst offender by far in immorality. Remember, this world that has for years been thinking sex, eating, sleeping, studying and talking it day and night is all but dead and buried in it. And there is good reason. Properly taught, sex education cannot be divorced from godliness in general. After all, the most compelling reason for morality is its part in Jehovah God’s requirements of those men and women who would win his final approval. Flouting his law is nothing new. Anciently the heathen worshiped sex and on occasion influenced God’s covenant people Israel to likewise succumb to such orgies. Degradation and God’s disfavor fell over the land to the ruinous tune of adultery by the matrons, harlotry on the part of the daughters and sacrifice by the men in company with temple prostitutes. —Hosea 4:12-14, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An American Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christendom, like Israel, while professing godliness, remains deaf to God’s Word and is snared in demonism. Hence, its last days, as foretold, are days of violence and debauchery, egged on by the spirit of driving devils. (2 Timothy 3:1-5; Revelation 16:14-16) The blind weaklings motivated by brute passion rather than brains will consume the crop to the full. The egotistical smart alecs will, in their &quot;enlightenment”, ride along on the band wagon while giving thanks that they are not like other men of former generations. And the simple fool will let his children soak’up what they can where they can for whatever use they may wish to make of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reasoning parents motivated by true love, particularly those devoted to God and his Word, will leave nothing to chance. Whether or not sex education is taught in school, they will see to it that the right knowledge is imparted at home. Unlike the Victorians, they will not deceptively neglect their child’s training now, to blame it on the helpless old stork later. Unlike the modernists, they will not open the door for a barrage of sex hormones, glands and technical terms to rush in, prey upon their offspring’s mind, devour reason and reduce natural instincts to animalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like individuals of sound mind they will reason that where the mind and thoughts are, there the child’s heart will be. Consequently, there also will his footsteps lead him. God’s law states as much, promising the devoted parents that their careful training will yield desirable results. (Deuteronomy 6:7; Proverbs 22:6) Wisely, they will remember and follow the advice of the apostle who said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things. The things which you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these; and the God of peace will be with you.” —Philippians 4:8, 9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">L</span><span class="font1">OST amid the snow-peaked ramparts of The Himalayas, almost forgotten by the greater portion of the world around her, apparently reposing in calm placidity at 16,000 feet above sea level, is the strangest land in the world—Tibet. The recent</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">--Strange Land</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">communist invasion of this quaint country has turned the eyes and attention of diplomats, statesmen and people of the world to “the roof of the world”. A land of blighted superstition, Tibet has ever remained buried in the depths of antiquity. Tibet of today is almost the same as Tibet of a thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Geographically, Tibet, with its 470,000 square miles in extent, occupies a position high bbove the rest of the world. The lofty Himalayan mountains, with their steep cliffs and declivities, inaccessible deserts and quagmire, form an insurmountable barrier on Tibet’s southern border. Access to the country is effected from its eastern,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">north and northwestern borders, which are flanked by China, Mongolia, and Chinese Turkestan, respectively. This seclusion no doubt is largely responsible for its lack of progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Very little is known concerning the early history of Tibet. The people are of Mongolian descent, and to this day the similarity between the two races in outward appearance and physical characteristics is remarkable. In general, with the exception of the lamas, the people are divided into two classes, the rich and the poor. Glimpses of their lives afford us some insight as to how these people live. In conformity with the rest of the world, the rich lord it over the poor. What little is available of the necessities of life is mostly taken up by the rich, which leaves just about nothing for the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The houses of the rich are built of mud and stone, square-shaped, with a single entrance. Generally they consist of three stories, with a fiat roof which is used for drying grain and sometimes for parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In direct contrast to the Hch, the one-story mud houses of the poorer cultivators are little better than hovels. Their domestic beasts occupy the ground floor, and the family, living no better than their beasts, occupy the first floor. Unable to procure fuel these people suffer intensely from the biting cold. Many of them are known to sleep and work in the same clothes for months, with the result that their garments get very dirty, which, far from disgusting the wearer, is welcomed* by him because it affords more warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Marriage customs in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tibet</span><span class="font2"> should bulge the eyes of the most seasoned American divorcee. According to the Tibetan custom, a boy weds at the age of twenty to a girl of his own social standing. The marriage is arranged by the parents after obtaining the consent of the young man and the approval of the local astrologer. The eager bridegroom certainly requires great patience. The astrologer with his report, the consent of both parties, the exchange of gifts and dowries, the discussions of the go-betweens, etc., and all the other details and arrangements, serve to postpone the eventful day by several weeks. If the husband has any younger brothers, the wife weds each in turn, with an interval of a year between each marriage. Incest is also common, and should offenders be arrested, they get off with light punishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fair-skinned, (Jark-eyed, well-developed Tibetan woman can certainly be described as beautiful. The Tibetan lady spends several hpurs at her toilet. In earlier times fat used to be rubbed into the skin at bedtime, but this is now replaced by cream imported from India. They are no different from their sisters the world over, so far as fashion Is concerned, and on special occasions bedeck themselves enough to attract a great deal of attention. In business they have an exceptional flair for salesmanship and often help their husbands even to the extent of controlling the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">entire business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Selling is done in the local bazaar, which, unlike other bazaars, is a portable one, similar to that of an auction sale, with the sellers as the auctioneers. The locality is generally the main street, where the sellers display their goods, and it is a common sight to see large crowds shouting and haranguing over the prices. The few stalls erected are presided over by women. Their natural aptitude for having the “last word” serves them in good stead against the most astute bargain-hunter and also derives a good net income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hidden away in those heights it is known that there are mineral deposits of unascertainable value; gold has been found, and it is thought that some radioactive metal may be there. But due to the belief that to disturb the earth will bring failure of crops and calamities on the Dalai Lama, the living Buddha, they will not permit it to be mined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What the cow is to the Hindus of India the yak is even more so to the Tibetans, for it provides food, shelter and clothing. The rising sun sees the Tibetan plowing with a yak, dressed in a garment made from yak hair; at noon he returns to his home, which is built partly of yak bones and horns. He sits down to a meal which will consist of either cheese made from yak milk or dried yak meat. His beverage will be yak-butter tea, of which he drinks 50 to 60 cups a day. As the cold evening sets in he will light his yak-butter lamp and warm himself with a Are made of yak dung. Should he be a traveler he will carry a tent made from yak hair and cross the rivers in a boat made from yak leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mules are used for transport on the trade route to Kalimpong. Burdened with goods weighing about 180 pounds, the strength and endurance displayed by these animals on the steep mountain paths borders on the incredible. There are two trade routes to India and two to China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All roads in Tibet have their source in Lhasa, the capital. Of the few good-sized towns in Tibet, Lhasa is the most populated and influential. The name “Lhasa” means “the place of the gods”. Standing on the tributary Kyi, it is roughly a mile square, with much open space for market places and parade grounds. Situated on a low hill rises the imposing Pot ala Palace In all its grandeur. It is indeed one of the (tew man-made wonders of the world; it is 900 feet in length and more than 400 feet high. The gold roofs of the red-and-white Potala flash and sparkle in the sun so that it may be seen a great distance from Lhasa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three and a half miles from Lhasa lies Drepung, the largest monastery in the world. Nearly 8,000 lamas inhabit this monastery. The number of lamas in comparison with the population is stupendous. This is largely due to an old custom among the people that one son from every household should be given to the priesthood. So fully one-sixth of the male population are lamas; this means that the largest proportion of the population take up religion as a profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both the lamas and the laity recognize the Dalai Lama as their supreme head and believe him to be the incarnation of Chen-resi, the patron saint of Tibet. Practically equal to him in power and position is the Panchen Lama, and he is involved in the present communist claim and invasion of Tibet. In 1923 a rift took place between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, with the result that the latter with his supporters promptly left for Kumbum monastery in western China and settled down there. His successor, a Tibetan, but Chinese born, was installed in the Kumbum monastery. He was later invited to Tibet to undergo the inauguration ceremony of the Panchen Lama after testing his claim with the other candidates in Tibet. He refused to do so, with the result that a second Panchen Lama was chosen in Tibet. Now the Chinese communists under Mao Tse-tung saw in the Chinese-born Panchen Lama from the Kumbum monastery an excellent medium for winning the support of the Tibetan people, half of whom owe allegiance<sup>1</sup> to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The communist invasion has awakened a long-slumbering nation to a world of grim reality. Through the smoky haze of a buried age, these quaint people observe with bewilderment and terror the triumphant march of the Red tyrant under whose tyrannical boot freedom is being crushed. The Red flame that consumed the vast land of China has now consumed “the roof of the world”—that strange land of antiquity.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>.. WHY THE INCREASING</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19510222_files/g_E_19510222-4.png" alt="" style="width:482pt;height:105pt;">
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">How Much Do We Actually Pay in Taxes and Why?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">1OSE who understand the Word of God appreciate that only God's kingdom can set all matters right. That truth we find strikingly underscored as we note the corruption, confusion, inefficiency and extravagance associated with the fiscal policies of a large nation. Also, we see in the ever-worsening situation a fulfillment of the prophecy that wicked men would go from bad to worse.—2 Timothy 3:13, An </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the tax situation is going from bad to worse is seen by a comparison of the taxes paid by the people of New York city 120 years ago with what they are paying now. Since 1830 their city taxes have increased 21 times, state taxes 50 times and their federal taxes 150 times. For the year 1950 total taxes for the United States, federal, state and local governments came to more than 53 billion dollars. That's onefourth of the nation’s income and more than its food bill. Did you know that your taxes cost more than your food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If this seems incredible to you it is only because you overlook “hidden” taxes. And if you earn $5,000 or less a year your “hidden&quot; or indirect taxes are doubtless higher than your direct taxes. A recent tax survey showed that a $10,000 house involved $2,500 in hidden taxes, a $2,000 automobile, $500. Why, there are at least 100 different hidden taxes involved in the sale of a dozen eggs, 116 in the cost of a suit of clothes, and 151 in just a loaf of bread. How can that be, you ask?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consider, for example, a loaf of bread which has six basic ingredients: flour, salt, yeast, sugar, powdered milk and malt.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">LOAD</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19510222_files/g_E_19510222-5.png" alt="" style="width:148pt;height:153pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Each of these involves a producer or farmer, one or more processors or manufacturers, distributors and railroads. And each of these pays as many as 35 different federal taxes, about as many state taxes, and also a number of local taxes. All these taxes are added to the cost of the products or services rendered, business merely acting as collection agencies for the government. So we find each business shifting the tax burden to the next fellow until it finally reaches the consumer, who, being unable to pass it along, pays the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">War Makes High Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Someone has well stated that “the crime of taxation is not in taking it; it's in the way it’s spent!&quot; How are the billions collected in taxes spent? As regards the federal tax bill, more than 70 per cent of the $40 billion can be charged to wars, past, present and future. In this amount are included expenses for defense, $7 billion for veterans, $5| billion interest on the national debt, some $3 billion in foreign aid, etc. (Since the beginning of World War I the United States has spent $81 billion in aid to foreign lands.) The less than 30 per cent remaining takes care of all other expenses incurred by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Corruption Makes High Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But war cannot be given the entire blame for high taxes. Corruption comes a close second. One modem popular writer (Oursler), referring to modem rampant political corruption in an article entitled</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Twilight of Honor&quot;, states: “The shocking lack of morality and integrity in public life Is a dire threat to the nation . . . Never before In America has official conscience fallen so low, or official Impudence grown so brash; and never before has public apathy seemed more profound.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The actions of such as the military aid to President Truman, General Harry Vaughan in the Maragon affair and his being kept in his position by the president in spite of the shocking exposures show that corruption has reached clear to the top and is being winked at by the chief executive himself. What can be expected of the underlings if the big boss himself acts that way? No wonder there is padding of payrolls, of expense accounts; no wonder the government is losing millions upon millions of dollars in revenue due it from properties rented to private businesses, to mention but a few cases of corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Extravagance Makes High Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Hoover Commission was appointed by President Truman for the purpose of recommending ways of eliminating extravagance and waste from the executive branch of the government Among other things it found that government departments had a surplus of supplies to the value of two and a half billion dollars; some departments having supplies on hand to last them from one to fifty years! They found that over half of the requisitions put through were for amounts less than ten dollars and that it cost more than ten dollars to put through each requisition. Also that each government department is ambitious to get as big as possible, and so adds as many to its personnel as possible, called &quot;empire building”, but they are all very reluctant to let help go even though not needed. As a result, as a recent press dispatch showed, whereas in 1900 one out of 24 workers was employed by the government^ (federal, state or local), in 1950 one out of ten was so employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indicative of the bureaucratic inefficiency and waste is the procedure noted in the following item taken from a national news magazine: “Is it necessary that the army put a simple order for buying onions through 288 separate steps as discovered by an investigator for the House Appropriations Committee? The order was date-stamped, time-stamped, examined, routed, copied, typed, receipted, entered on other documents, underlined, described, card-punched, coded, tabulated, checked, matched, filed, discussed, reviewed technically, indexed, analyzed, maijed, abstracted, printed, registered, inspected, sorted, stored, transmitted, and vouchered. Messengers handled the order 110 times in sending it through eighteen divisions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And in referring to the waste in the defense department another national weekly asks: “Who will tell the army and navy what every ex-GI knows—that the services could provide the same security with a billion dollar saving in airplane junkets for the generals and admirals and boondoggling projects for the ambitious colonels?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We read of 70,000 tanks built during the last war, although the very most that the United States was able to use was 20,000 and its allies 12,000, or a total of 32,000. Also, of the great waste In selling surplus</span></p><img src="g_E_19510222_files/g_E_19510222-6.png" alt="" style="width:322pt;height:221pt;">
<p><span class="font2">or obsolete equipment, like the six sub* marines that were soklto a Florida deep-sea fisherman for $40,000 and who made an easy net.profit of $615,000 on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Hoover commission discovered that the war department had asked for funds to modernize 102 more Sherman tanks than they had on hand; and by a typist’s error had asked for 39 instead of 9 million dollars for some howitzers. Nobody had noticed the mistake. What’s a mere 30 million to the defense department? An order was put through for tropical worsted suits at $129 each, more than one for each man in the army. After the Hoover Commission’s investigation the order was canceled. Somebody changed his mind, effecting a saving of more than 100 million dollars. Two and a third billion was requested fop construction purposes. When Congress asked for details, it took the war department a month to furnish them. Among the items listed were: 910 family houses m Alaska at $59,350 each; 828 family houses in Guam at $48,000 each, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Government hospitals also came in for censure. The average man spends less than a day and a half in a private hospital to have his tonsils removed, but active army personnel averaged more than 16 days in the government hospitals for each tonsillectomy. Each department insists on its own hospitals in the large cities and so there is much needless duplication. Many of the hospitals are less than half filled and yet more are being built in the veuy same areas, The new Navy hospital at Moffatt Field had an average of two patients a day during 1948! In such hospital not only are the Immediate members of the active personnel given free and complete care, but in onq year some 24 million dependents of veterans received some form of free medical care. At present the large majority of cases handled by veterans’ hospitals have absolutely nothing to do with the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently an investigation revealed that in a certain army center (St. Louis) veterans’ beneficiaries had been overpaid to the extent of $157,000,000! In presenting its budget the Veteran’s administration listed one billion dollars for &quot;salaries and expenses”. Why bother with details!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But let us leave the defense and veteran’s departments and see how the taxpayer’s money is spent by those engaged in more peaceable pursuits. Take the Post Office department. Last year it had a deficit of one-half billion dollars. Being run on the patronage basis it is doomed to inefficiency from top to bottom. It costs the post office 24 cents to print and deliver the penny postal card. It is supposed to be the poor man’s letter, but 85 per cent of them are used by business firms. Millions of dollars are lost by congressmen permitting lobbyists to take advantage of their franking privileges whereby propaganda is sent through the mails first class free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then there is that government agency that so delight^ to throw away the taxpayers’ money wholesale—the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Its activities have recently come up for severe criticism and not without good cause. To what extent such Ioans as the $975,000 loan made to a Reno, Nevada, hotel (whose business depended upon a gambling casino which it housed) are the result of lack of judgment or lack of integrity each reader can decide for himself, and put his own construction on the statement of one of its former directors: &quot;As it stands now, anybody with any brains in the private lending business wouldn’t make a lot of loans we do.” Loans default and more of the taxpayers’ money takes wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the heading “The Battle That Squanders Billions&quot; Leslie Miller, exgovernor of Wyoming and chairman of that part of the Hoover Commission con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cemed with natural resources, tells a tale of rivalry between the army engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation wherein “billions are being squandered on duplicating and badly engineered projects”. When the Bureau of Reclamation decided to build a dam of the most questionable value it let nothing like a highway or railroad stand in its way, even though it cost one and a half million dollars to move the highway and 15 million to move the roadbed of the railroad, the latter requiring the blasting of a tunnel a mile long through solid rock!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the dams are built without even making sure that there will be enough water to make it worth while! For instance —the Kendrick dam in Wyoming was built at a cost of 24 million dollars in 1934-5, but not until 1947 was there any surplus of water so as to make it serve its purpose. Among the more ambitious projects now under construction Is one involving the boring of a tunnel 13 J miles long through the Continental Divide, that backbone of solid rock of the American continent. Estimated at a cost of 44 million, its cost is nearing the 200 million mark and at that it will come far short of supplying the water originally claimed for the project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fantastic Fiscal Farm Folly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The way the agriculture department wastes the taxpayers’ money presents a tale almost too fantastic to be believed. Proceeding upon the theory that farm prices need government support, for the past seventeen years the government has pegged farm prices, buying up the surpluses at its set price. With what result? Its potato support has cost it a half billion dollars alone. Having bought millions of bushels and not being able to sell them on the market, the government resold the potatoes, for which it had paid from $1.65 to $2.90 a bag, back to the farmers at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">one cent</span><span class="font2"> a bag! Unprincipled farmers immediately resold them to the government at the regular rate! So the government had to dye them blue so that the farmers could and would use them only for hog feed or fertilizer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">।</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In one instance the government bought the potatoes at $2.90 a bag from a Maine farmer, shipped to Illinois at the cost of $1.10 a bag and then sold them to another farmer for fertilizer at a cent a bag, or at a loss of $3.99 per bag! One farmer bought 1,800 bags of potatoes for $18, fed them to his hogs which he then sold at $28 per hundredweight; sold the empty bags for ten cents each. He had made 900 per cent profit on the bags alone and fed his hogs for nothing! Does that make sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And how did the potato farmers fare? In one of the greatest potato counties in Maine, the farmers got 67 million dollars for their potatoes from the government in one year. Thirty-one farmers got checks ranging from $100,000 to $450,000; 146 farmers got from $50,000 to $100,000; 468 got from $25,000 to $50,000; and 1,200 farmers received from $15,000 to $25,000 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And that’s just one farm commodity! The potatoes, which cost the government a half billion dollars, had to be sold for fertilizer or hog feed because potatoes do not keep, but two billion dollars* worth of other commodities are now in storage (a small amount having been used for relief purposes). Mountains of cotton seed is stored right out in the open, there being no facilities to store it; some 600 million bushels of com is kept in airplane hangars, etc.; the 100 million pounds of butter is kept in refrigeration plants as is also the 76 million pounds of powdered eggs; storage of such items runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Also in storage is 400 million bushels of wheat, enough to furnish every man, woman and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">child in the United States with more than one loaf of bread per week. And that does not begin to exhaust the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Government Pork Barrel</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Space does not permit going into detail regarding the other follies of the agriculture department such as having some 178 agents in one county to advise its 2,500 farmers, etc., and so we hasten to the consideration of another great drain on the taxpayers’ money—the “pork barrel”. As one press report puts it: “ 'Pork/ in Congressional definition, constitutes proposed unwarranted spending of Federal funds on projects that will please local constituents and produce votes for their sponsors.” Says the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal,</span><span class="font2"> “Knock on any door and you will find a man with his hand in the public purse. Farmer, laborer, businessman ... all seem to be sitting with palm outstretched. The posture personifies the politics of our times. Never before in this country has the government made such frank appeals to cupidity. . . . There is, of course, nothing new in the idea of raiding the public treasury. What is novel is its newly acquired respectability. . . . Businessmen have been in the forefront of those denouncing government extravagance. Yet, when the line is formed, there are businessmen seeking subsidies for this or that industry . . . the big businessman seeking millions and the little businessman seeking thousands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All are for economy—as far as the other fellow is concerned. Typical of such pork barrel politics was the measure recently passed by both houses of Congress (in the House without even the formality of a roll call!) and signed by the president which provided for a new post office building in each of the 435 Congressional districts, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">whether one was needed</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not! </span><span class="font2">As a starter 40 million dollars was appropriated; how much the bill would eventually run to, nobody knew or cared. Also, in recent months a bill was passed authorizing expenditures close to two billion dollars for hundreds of river, harbor and flood control projects in nearly every state. When signing the measure the president admitted that many of them were unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another project involved 250 million dollars to dredge a river. Three government agencies were fighting for the benefits to be derived from the dredging but there would be enough water for only one. Why invest a quarter of a billion dollars in a project before definitely ascertaining whether its purpose is to benefit navigation, irrigation or soil conservation? When a number of such ‘pork’ measures came up in Congress one senator (Douglas-Illinois) began to point out their weaknesses, one by one, but he seemed to be like a voice crying in the wilderness. After a number of valiant but futile attempts to save the taxpayer’s money, he got discouraged and gave up trying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, the crime of taxation is not merely that taxes are high, 20, 50 and 100 times higher than they were a century ago, but is the way the tax money is being spent. War again dips deep into the public till. Corruption and pork barrel politics continue to take their toll. And though time, money and energy were spent by some of the country’s foremost citizens in ferreting ways and means for ending governmental inefficiency and extravagance it seems to have been all in vain, for late reports tell us: “Reforms in Peril, Hoover Warns, Citing Fight by 'Vested’ Interests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, men cannot expect any relief from the ever-mounting staggering tax burden until the Theocracy, the kingdom of God, replaces all selfish, weak and corrupt governmental efforts of man. Then righteousness will spring forth and man on earth will long enjoy the work of his hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">HpODAY the subject of blood </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font2"> substitutes is one of vital interest to every one, even the most healthy. Why? Because in view of the ever-worsening political situation the prospect of an atomic attack becomes daily more real, and an atomic attack plays havoc with the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to one medical authority (quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter,</span><span class="font2"> July 8, 1950), if atomic war comes, “Gelatin and dextran may have to be used as plasma substitutes in the case of mass burn casualties because there probably won’t be enough blood and plasma/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For a long time the medical profession has been rather slow and reluctant (at least so it seems to the layman) to explore and exploit the possibilities of blood substitutes. Note the tenor of the following (written as late as 1947) by Drs. Taylor and Waters, as quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Blood Derivatives and Substitutes,</span><span class="font2"> by White, and which expresses the orthodox medical opinion on the subject of blood substitutes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* (a) The molecule of the dissolved substance must be of a size that the fluid will not leave the body too freely; (b) the fluid must exert an osmotic pressure and possess a viscosity approaching as closely as possible to that of whole blood; these qualifications depend upon the molecular size and shape; (c) it should be as nearly as possible isotonic with the contents of the red cells; (d) it must, of course, be non-antigenic and innocuous in every respect. In addition, it should be readily available, preferably inexpensive and capable of being quickly and easily prepared for intravenous administration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stated in nonprofessional language, the molecules of a blood substitute should have as great a diameter as those of blood plasma, through the walls of the blood vessels and kidneys. This process of liquids passing through a&lt;membrane is known as “osmosis”, and th^ extent to which a fluid does this is&quot; termed its “osmotic pressure”. Also, the molecules must not be too long, as that would impart a greater stickiness or viscosity to the fluid, which would throw extra work on the heart. Gelatin normally has both of these weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The substitute must have the right kind of salt solution, in harmony with, or “isotonic” with, the red corpuscles, otherwise the little sacs which contain the hemoglobin are dissolved. Actually, the red cells are like so many ships in a stream, and the prime problem of a blood substitute is to furnish the liquid for them to float and navigate in and to give the heart something to pump, or else it will stop. Also, any fluid injected into the circulatory system must not contain any antagonistic foreign elements, known as antigens (usually composed of protein), which would cause the system to form antibodies to counteract them; so, as above expressed, the fluid must be “nonantigenic”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Merits of Saline Solutions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, it does not at all follow that anything less than a perfect substitute must be rejected. For, says W. Kaempffert (New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font2"> October 22, 1950):</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Despite their limitations, the Public Health Service, on the advice of the Sur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">gery Study Section of the' National Institute of Health, announced on October 13 that salt </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">solutions</span><span class="font1"> were as effective as blood plasma in the emergency treatment of shock from serious burns and other injuries. One level teaspoonful of table salt and one-half teaspoonful of sodium citrate and another of baking soda in a quart of water are considered about right. If sodium citrate is not available, baking soda may be substituted for it. [Such a solution is drunk.] . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A quest for a cheap and satisfactory substitute for blood, easy to administer, led the Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals in New York city to experiment with sodium salts in treating bums. Dr. Charles I. Fox, Jr., who has been conducting the experiments, says that 'we have treated severe cases of burns with isotonic solutions of sodium salts, or solutions in the same proportion as those of the body fluids, without the use of blood or plasma, and clinical trials to date have been satisfactory’,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Dr. Fox’s work has involved more than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">100 cases</span><span class="font1"> treated with the exclusive use of sodium salt solution, without blood or plasma.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After giving a history of the efforts to utilize gelatin and the results obtained therefrom, Kaempffert further report?:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Under the direction of Dr. Ellice McDonald, the Biochemical Foundation of Newark, Delaware, also experimented with a gelatin plasma substitute. The subjects were rabbits which had . . . suffered great damage from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">shock.' Drs. J. O. Ely and A.</span><span class="font1"> W. Angulo of the Biochemical Foundation’s staff gave the shocked rabbits a . . . gelatin-glucose-salt solution [which] proved to be as effective as blood serum in combating the increased concentration of red cells when serum was lost and blood thickened, and in restoring blood volume after as much as 60 per cent of the blood </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span class="font1"> rabbit’s circulatory system had been drained off. The Biochemical Research Foundation’s substitute for blood and plasma is based on the needs of tissue culture for growth. In this respect it seems to differ from most other substitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;So far as the record goes nothing was done with this gelatin-glucose-salt solution of the Biochemical Research Foundation. The results obtained in burns and hemorrhages in rabbits were so striking that it ought to be given a fair trial in hospitals. The prospect of putting up a gelatin substitute for plasma or serum is too bright to be ignored.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mayo Clinic Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The orthodox conservative medical attitude toward blood substitutes received quite a jolt recently from none other than Dr. John S. Lundy, who is the anesthesiology chief at the Mayo clinic, one of the country’s top anesthesiologists and &quot;who introduced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sodium pentothal, now one</span><span class="font1"> of the world’s most widely used anesthetics (in smaller quantities, it’s known as 'truth serum’)”. He believes, according to the Minneapolis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Tribune,</span><span class="font1"> November 4,1950, that there are three blood substitutes that can &quot;be backed as valuable and even life-saving agents:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’ 'Dextran—A sugar industry by-product first used in Sweden, still regularly used there and tested successfully here by Dr. Lundy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Periston—A chemical developed in Germany during World War n.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Gelatin—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ordinary animal bone gelatin,</span><span class="font1"> but of medical purity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After telling that “there is still no wide agreement in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">United States that in </span><span class="font1">dextran, periston and gelatin effective substances have finally been found”, the article lists the advantages that Dr. Lundy sees in using such substitutes—and for whole blood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;L There Is much skepticism today about plasma, for it has often carried a virus causing a serious liver disease. Ultraviolet irradiation supposedly kills this virus, but the question of whether or not it really does so is still open,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“2. No fluid is any good unless it stays in the vessels to keep up blood pressure and volume. Even plasma tends to seep out too fast. The new substitutes remain a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“3. Blood banks are being operated at increasingly high cost—which could be cut by stock-piling the substitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">*'4. Large-scale transfusions are getting more and more complicated as scientists discover more blood groups and subgroups and varieties that should not be mismatched. The less need for whole blood, the less this problem. Dr. Lundy believes a substitute can be used ‘wholly or partly* instead of whole blood in some cases. When a patient, for instance, loses three pints of his own blood, he may sometimes be given two pints of blood and one of the substitute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“5. With ‘the potential problem of preparing for another war’, use of substitutes could relieve the need for blood and plas-ma—and provide a substance which could be given in an emergency without previous examination for blood type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Swedish ‘blood substitute* dextran is an almost colorless fluid. Swedish doctors first reported its use in 1944. Dr. Lundy began trying it in April 1946 and up to January 1, 1950, had administered it to some 1,500 patients. Animal studies have been under way, too, in the Mayo foundation. With duty, Swedish dextran now costs about $8.50 a pint. It is also made in Great Britain and a company in Terre Haute, Indiana, has entered the field ... Even at $8.50, dextran is cheaper than Wood or plasma—where the patient must pay $25 to $40 a pint unless his friends or relatives can replenish a hospital's blood bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In the recently published 1949 report of the Mayo clinic's anesthesiology section, Dr. Lundy and associates teli of several cases—five or six last year—in which patients remained in severe shock, near death, despite several normal blood transfusions. With dextran, blood volume and pressure were restored and the patients recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ ‘We would not want to be without them/ the doctors comment on all three of the substitute fluids.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most remarkable indeed is the fact that, to quote Science </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">News Letter,</span><span class="font2"> October 28, 1950, on these experiments, “in five or six cases [dextran] was considered of lifesaving importance, having helped patients who had not benefited from several transfusions of blood/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also showing the widespread use and value of dextran and its superiority over blood plasma in many cases is the following report taken from the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font2">December 24,1950: “Dr. Gunnar Thorson, a Stockholm surgeon, recently presented a report ... of some near-miracles produced by the substance in counteracting shock in victims of accidents who to all appearances were lifeless. Thus far, he reported, more than 25,000 cases have been treated in Sweden with the refined products, with bad reactions in only onefifth of one per cent. This was said to be better than the Swedish or American experience with blood plasma.” Reporting on this same matter the Washington (D. C.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font2"> December 18, 1950, tells that due to the effectiveness of dextran “use of plasma has been almost completely abandoned in Sweden”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Progress nas also been made with other blood substitutes such as pectin and isinglass, and surely, in view of the foregoing, more progress will be made.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Argument Blood Substitutes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">from a blood or plasma transfusion Is still plaguing the medical profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Jaundice contracted in recent blood transfusions has contributed to, or even caused, deaths. Search for the formula that will doom the virus once and for all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W</span><span class="font2">HILE the matter of supplying a sufficient quantity of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plasma</span><span class="font2"> in the event of an atomic attack has been one of the major reasons for increased interest in blood substitutes, there are other reasons more potent and immediate. Strongest reason, to those who accept the Scriptures as the inspired Word of God, is the direct ban by the Creator himself. Yes, according to the Bible life is sacred and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">blood is </span><span class="font2">sacred because the “life is in the blood”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then there is the matter of diseased blood. Doctors gloss over the hazards involved in the matter of contaminated blood. Yet the medical profession still has far to go in this regard. Outstanding weakness is its failure to rid human blood of the hepatitis virus (causing the serious liver malady more commonly known as yellow jaundice). This virus ran rampant through the United States Army during World War II, some 200,000 Soldiers being stricken with it; and it is estimated, that from 60 to 100 thousand of these acquired it via blood transfusions. Each case accounted for a loss of 62 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Writing in the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">World Telegram and Sun,</span><span class="font2"> October 24, 1950, on the efforts of medical science to conquer the hepatitis virus, George Keaney, staff science writer, had the following to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The virus of yellow jaundice, believed two years ago to have been killed in blood plasma, is still very much alive. And the danger of contracting jaundice (or the disease of the liver, hepatitis, of which the yellowness of jaundice is the outward sign) must go on; . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Speculation goes on in the medical world as to whether the fault lies in irradiation itself or whether it’s in errors in processing, whether one kind of virus is rendered harmless by the ultraviolet ray and others aren't, and whether the quantity of plasma treated may hold the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association,</span><span class="font2"> three doctors challenge the effectiveness of uitraviotet light on the virus in plasma. Drs. Nathan Rosenthal, Frank A. Bassen and Sidney Michael have reported on the results of transfusions with irradiated plasma on 13 patients. Within three or four months two patients became jaundiced and a third, who got a transfusion of whole blood from a donor who had taken the plasma, became jaundiced 71 days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The carrier never showed a jaundice symptom. One may be Infected heavily for years and never be affected or show that he is a potential menace as a blood donor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patients got no other blood or tyood </span><span class="font2">products, the doctors say. . , . There, was nothing else to lay the blame on but the plasma.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same writer on the following day, October 25, told of further such results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In a report in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association, Drs, Roy</span><span class="font2"> N. Barnett, R. A. Fox and J. G. Snavely give the histories of three cases involving transfusions with irradiated plasma [at two different hospitals]. Each patient received one</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">unit of plasma and all three developed jaundice. Two of the patients died, one at each hospital. ‘Since they received no potential source of hepatitis other than a single unit of irradiated plasma, it seems reasonable to indict the plasma as the vehicle of the virus/ they said.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now for an ironic touch to the foregoing, note the following, taken from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font2"> for August 19, 1950, under the title, “Irradiated Plasma Danger”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Some of the blood plasma being collected and stored for use in a possible atomic disaster may actually harm the victims instead of saving them. If they are suffering from bleeding diseases, as many atomic victims would be, this particular plasma will make them worse, because it interferes with the clotting of normal blood. Warning of this danger is given by Drs. Seymour S. Cutler, Benjamin Burbank and Eugene R. Marzullo, of Long Island College Hospital and Long Island Medical College, Brooklyn, New York, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font2"> (July 22). This plasma may, on the other hand, be useful for patients whose blood has too much clotting tendency, as in cases of thrombosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The plasma with the anticlotting tendency is that which has been radiated with ultraviolet light from the Schumann region of the spectrum, with wave lengths from 1,751 to 2,026 angstrom units. Ultraviolet light is used to sterilize pooled batches of blood plasma. This is done because some plasmas contain the virus of serum jaundice. Irradiation at 2,537 angstrom units did not cause the change in clotting, the Brooklyn scientists found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The reason for the change in clotting, or coagulability, after irradiation from Schumann region ultraviolet light is not known. The fact that a body fluid, such as the blood, is so profoundly altered biochemically by this part of the ultraviolet calls for more investigation, the scientists point out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So It seems that the men of medical science are getting farther and farther away from their goal, for by irradiating plasma they not only failed to destroy the hepatitis virus, but actually injure the clotting properties of the blood. Surely as time goes on men have, even apart from the position of God’s Word on the subject, less and less reason for using blood plasma and more and more reasons for delving into the field of blood substitutes.</span></p>

Also, infotmatlon has been given as to what was involved in the way of risks and about the powers of the body to recuperate without the help of blood transfusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To show that transfusions are not always as imperative as doctors often contend, and to show what frequently happens when one of Jehovah’s witnesses refuses to take blood intravenously, or in any other form or way, the following letters are published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Recently I took very ill with hemorrhage. Upon having my most trusted phy-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fiteian examine me, hfr said that I must immediately have two or more blood transfusions if I expected to get well. I refused them, as I realized that this was against God’s law. I explained to him why I was refusing, giving him Gpd’s Word for proof. After learning my positive stand he felt that there was nothing further he could do for me. I did not take any transfusions, but nevertheless began to improve. This is five months later and I am well and able to do my work and service. Thank you for explaining this matter in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower”</span><span class="font2">—Mrs, E. J. M., St. Petersburg, Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I had two bouts of hemorrhaging and the last one robbed me of so much blood that I was weak and colorless and had to go to the hospital. The doctor urged a blood transfusion and when I refused he seemed none too pleased. He told me that if I didn't have it I would be months getting back to normal again. I told him that I preferred to build up my blood through -correct diet and he told me that that would take too long, and that a transfusion would give me a &quot;pickup” at once. However, I stuck to my guns. Going back to my regular physician for a checkup two or three weeks later, he was surprised to see how rapidly I’d improved.”—Mrs. W. L. K., Newport, Delaware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;In February, 1945, I was admitted to the Western Suburbs Hospital, Croyden, Sydney, Australia, having a blood count of less than one million cells or about one-fifth of normal. According to the medicos, my only hope of existence lay in blood transfusions, and so for eight months I endured transfusions. Three times I suffered septic from the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Although the flicker of life appeared to pick up a little after each transfusion, they were exhausting and very painful, as they had to cut my legs to find a vein in which to insert the needle, as the veins had collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I prayed to die, and then reallied that this was self-pity, and so prayed that I might be faithful unto death. When conscious and able to see, I read my </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazines, which were brought in regularly. Thus in one of these periods I read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> July 1,1945, article on “Sanctity of Blood”. I read it and reread it. Transfusions a violation of the everlasting covenant!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;I was afraid. Disease had changed my blood to water. For eight months I had suffered and fought for life—was all this to be in vain? After again reviewing the Scriptures on the subject my decision was made. I would not be a covenant breaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Timidly a nurse was told, then the sister, then the doctors, lastly my own husband, then opposed to the truth, now a person of good will. Persuasion, bluster, threats, appeals by all of them failed to move me. I was told it was suicide. The patients, although unable to understand, said they admired the stand I took. One doctor lost his temper after failing to persuade me, saying, <sup>f</sup>Ypu won’t be here much longer to argue with anyone.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Finally I was permitted to go from the hospital, but no outside doctor would treat me, as I had refused their only possible cure. A homeopath began treatment, without any hope either. For months I hovered between life and death and then came a slight improvement which continued until finally after more than a year, recovery came. Today I am fully active in Jehovah’s service, walking miles in the field service, enjoying street witnessing, attending all the meetings.”-—Mrs. N, B., Hammondville, N.S.W., Australia,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">tor said that he must have a blood transfusion In order to save his life, as the loss of blood combined with the effect of sulfa drugs had weakened him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Unknown to Bro. G--- (he being</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in a semiconscious state) a nephew, who was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses, volunteered to furnish the blood. However, when the nephew arrived the next morning, Bro. G---- was awake, and, learning of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">intended blood transfusion, told the nurse that he would not submit to one. She said, ‘You will have to see the doctor? He replied, ‘It makes no difference. I am not taking a blood transfusion? The doctor, when informed of his attitude, replied, I admire you for your integrity to your belief, but if you will not take my prescribed treatment, you might as well go home. Bro. G---- was taken home that same</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">day and in less than a week he was able to be out of bed, and the wound that was thought to require a flesh graft healed completely without it According to late reports this brother is still alive and active though now past eighty years.”—G. R. W., Merced, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“May I relate an experience my husband had a year ago? J---- had stomach</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ulcers and began having hemorrhages. This kept up for a week after he entered the hospital, and so blood transfusions were ordered by the doctors. When J----</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">refused the transfusions the doctor and head nurse were quite surprised, and frankly told him and us, his mother and me. at his bedside, that they didn’t expect him to live without it. J- - explained our position and upon inquiry we gave them the scriptures to read which cover the subject. However, they thought it merely a matter of interpretation. Then we were asked to sign a paper relieving them of any responsibility in the case of death, as they expected him to die before morning,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The next morning J---- was better</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and continued to gain and in a few days, much to the surprise of the doctors and nurses, he left the hospital. In five weeks his blood was up to normal without any help from blood transfusions. On his last visit for a checkup the doctor told him, ‘The Lord certainly was with you, boy/ At the signing of the paper the doctor had said that faith in our religion was all right, but we were carrying it too far; when a person was that sick it was time to do something. We know of a similar case here with a like result?’—Mrs. J. D., Marshall, Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The position of the Christian enlightened by God’s Word is that blood transfusions come under God’s ban on the use of blood for food. He will therefore refuse them regardless of the consequences. However, the foregoing should demonstrate that blood transfusions are not always as imperative to recovery as doctors are wont to claim.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">♦ Size is not all there Ie to strength. The female stag beetle during an experiment dragged two fountain pens, a pencil and watch, a total weight ninety times her own, for a distance of thirty times her own length In twenty-five minutes. Suspended by her claws, she held a weight of 200 grams attached to her waist. Proportionately, a man weighing 160 pounds should be able to hang by his hands or feet while dangling 131 tons from his waist! Consider the common flea. With legs but 1/20 of an inch long, It can jump as far as thirteen inches horizontally and 73 inches high. A comparative human athlete would have to make a broad jump of 700 feet and a high jump of 450 feet. Multiplying man boasts only one individual for each sixteen acres. Yet the soD teems with from one to ten million insects per acre. A column four Inches in diameter reaching to the bottom of the Atlantic would contain 576 billion sea protozoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">The Trumans Sing</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Some people</span><span class="font23"> like to hear Margaret </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Tru</span><span class="font23">man sing, like the Saugus, Massachusetts, man who paid $16 taxi fare to get to the concert. He paid, but didn't hear, for the taxi driver, Incredulous that anyone would pay $16 just to hear Margaret sing, became suspicious and turned the man over to the secret service. He missed the concert</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Some people do not like her singing, like the Washington </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Post critic</span><span class="font23"> Paul Hume, who received the following from President Truman: &quot;I have just read your lousy review burled In the back pages. You sound like a frustrated old man who never made a success, an eight-ulcer man on a four-ulcer job, and all four ulcers working. I never met you, but if I do you'll need a new nose and plenty of beefsteak and perhaps a supporter below. Westbrook Pegler, a guttersnipe, Is a gentleman compared to you. You can take that as more of an insult than as a reflection on your ancestry.” Signed, &quot;H. S. T.” The critic said that this version left out a couple of paragraphs of the page and a half letter. It was reported that these were unprintable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Margaret Truman refused to believe her fathej would &quot;use language like that&quot;. She said, &quot;In the first place he wouldn't write a letter to Mr, Hume. ... I don't know why anyone would do anything like that and </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">sign my father’s</span><span class="font23"> name. liat Is ghastly.” But when the White House confirmed that Truman did write to the music critic, Margaret had nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Pegler's comeback was, “It is a great tragedy that in this awful hour the people of the United States must accept In lieu of leadership the nasty malice of a president whom Bernard Baruch in a similar incident called a rude, uncouth, ignorant man. Let us pray.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Truman’s vituperative outbursts are not new. In 1949 he used the term “s.o.b.” when speaking to a mixed audience. In 1950 he angered the Marines, saying they had a propaganda machine “almost equal to Sta Un’s&quot;. September 11, 1950, Drew Pearson said, &quot;Members of the White House staff are holding their breath for fear that some of the other tart, impetuous letters Truman has written will now leak out. For during the past five years H. S. T. has been writing pungent, profane paragraphs to various senators on all sorts of subjects. . . . While the president ^doesn’t go off on these tangents often, when he does, they are beauts.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whether you like Margaret’s singing or not, her father's oft-repeated off-key profanity certainly is not the proper tune for the president of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Shock Waves Shock Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Thunderclaps blasting oit of the clear blue sky! In this day of tense nerves, new and weird weapons and even talk of interplanetary travel, such phenomena are enough to excite the pp pulace of any average city. The citizens of Day ton, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California, will readily verify this. Last July Captain Newman and Lieutenant Collins took jet fighters up 43,000 feet, then went into power dives. Very rapidly they pushed past the speed of sound, forming with their great speed shock waves that trailed from the leading edges of their wings. At 28,000 feet the planes were pulled out of their screaming dives, leaving the shock waves, enhanced in force by the plane's turn-out, to continue straight down to earth. The ears of Daytonians caught the effects; a very loud and realistic explosion. On January 6, this year, a similar occurrence came when another jet plane pulled out of a supersonic dive over Los Angeles. Police and newspaper switchboards were flooded with hundreds of calls. A military Intelligence spokesman made the explanation that one of several new high-powered jet planes went into a 600 to 900 m.p.h. power dive from about 40,000 feet He attributed the explosion heard throughout the Los Angeles area to a vacuum caused by pressure of the plane's dive when it leveled off. To pilots no Instruments are needed to tell them when the speed of sound Is passed. Officers Newman and Collins, of the Dayton case, described the complete quietness that suddenly filled their cockpits at that point of the dive. Earthward they streaked in eerie silence until the pull-out snapped them back to the world of sound.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">No Real SelF-Gain Without Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">HE world glorifies material </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">success. It </span><span class="font2">idolizes and worships those who get ahead, who acquire great riches, or become outstanding in the arts or in sports, or who achieve fame in the realm of science or politics. Whether they get ahead by trampling underfoot aJ] those in their way, by stifling their conscience or by exploiting every human relationship, it does not matter. Hie main thing is to get ahead, to get on top. Yet, in spite of all their selfish striving, those in this old world are hastening down the broad road to destruction, to the losing of their soul, their life. The way of this world brings no real selfgain.—Matthew 16:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah God's way is as superior to the ways of this world as the heavens are higher than the earth. (Isaiah 55:8,9) His way is that of unselfishness, of love. (1 John 4:8,9) He sets the perfect example of love and requires that all creatures who would gain everlasting life imitate him. He purposed a new world of righteousness, of order. Peace and harmony, and which will last forever. Only those who respond to God's love by giving him their complete devotion and who love their neighbor as they love themselves will fit into that new world.—Mark 12:29-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God implanted a measure of love in the human heart, and to the extent that some traces of It still remain, to that extent there is appreciation of the fact that there is a happiness and blessedness with giving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">expression to love. Also, appreciation</span><span class="font2"> of the fact that God is just and loving leads</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 22<sub>:</sub> 1962</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">us to confidently expect that he will reward unselfishness. However, there is always the danger that the servants of God, while ostensibly serving him, may lose sight of the all-importance of the proper motive; or be side-tracked by temptation so as to be actually engaging in his work for some other motive than that of love. The Devil is a wily foe, and so where he is unable to turn one aside from God's service he tries to vitiate that one’s service by causing ulterior or vain motives to enter the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">apostle Paul, in his</span><span class="font2"> first fetter to the Corinthians, chapter 13, elaborates on the importance of having a pure motive for serving God. He begins his discussion of the subject with the observation: “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not have love<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> I have bt?-come a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal.*'—Verse 1, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although Paul had the gift to speak in many foreign tongues, more, in fact^ than any other Christian, yet he knew that if he used that gift merely to show off, regardless of whether or not he was being understood, his efforts would be in vain, like just so much noise. In his day some were so much absorbed with the glamor of the gift of tongues that it became necessary for Paul to command that no one should speak in a foreign tongue unless someone was present who. could interpret what was thus spoken under inspiration. (1 Corinthians 14:28) So we today should </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at all times use such language</span><span class="font2"> as can be understood by our audience, not a foreign</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tongue, nor even in the native tongue out with such flowery language that would only impress our hearers of our speakingability, but which would not inform or edify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Continues the apostle: “And If I have the gift of prophesying and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I hdve all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.” (1 Corinthians 13:2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font2"> Balaam, a prophet in the time of Moses, had the gift of prophecy, yet because he lacked love he was destroyed with the enemies of Jehovah God. (Numbers 31:8; Jude 11) Solomon had great knowledge, wisdom, as well as the gift of prophecy, but he Jacked Jove or he would never have permitted his heathen wives to turn his heart away from Jehovah God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font2">Kings 10:23; 11:4) Lacking in love, he died unfaithful. His other qualities brought him no real gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Judas had faith and knowledge. He was one of the twelve sent out with the power to “cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons”. (Matthew 10:8, New </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">World Trans.)</span><span class="font2"> But how much love did Judas show? When a repentant and grateful Mary showed her deep love for Jesus by anointing his feet with precious ointment, did Judas sympathetically enter into her experience and appreciate the sincere expression of affection that was there being shown? No. Instead of being thrilled that his Master was being given such a token of esteem, he grumbled at the cost of it, complaining that it should have been sold and the proceeds given to the poor. And that only because he had made a racket out of being the treasurer for the thirteen, and would have been able to keep some of it for himself. (John 12:3-6) Such extreme selfishness unchecked finally led to his betrayal of his Master and his destruction at his own hands. Yes, Judas had knowledge, he had faith, he performed miracles, and he preached the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">good news</span><span class="font2"> of the Kingdom, thereby doubtless profiting others; but by not having love it profited him nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So today, we may be able ministers of the gospel, we may have knowledge of the Bible and of human nature, we may understand the sacred secrets, the deep things of God's Word, we may have such faith as to overcome mountainlike obstacles. In all this we may bring many blessings to others, but unless we have love no blessing will accrue to ourselves. That is not the way it should be. God, In commanding us to serve him, has in mind our own welfare and blessing as well as the blessing of those to whom we minister. We should be watered as we water others. In fact, ours should be the greater blessing, for Paul tells us that Jesus said, “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving?’ (Acts 20:35, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font2"> But that will follow only if we give from a pure motive and with warmth, right from heart. There must be unselfish feeling and loving concern for those to whom we minister, not as though one were tossing scraps to a dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further emphasizing the fact that service without love brings no gain to oneself, Paul states: “And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body, that I may boast, but do not have love, I am not profited at all?’—1 Corinthians 13:3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Appealing to vanity by publicly passing the collection plate and by publishing the lists of contributors and the amounts they give is in striking contrast to the principles set down in the Bible by Christ Jesus and the apostles. Those who make gifts to charity for the purpose of receiving a good name can expect no other reward. It will no more profit them than such selfish giving profited Ananias and Sapphira.—Matthew 6:1-4; Acts 5:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same principle holds true in respect to those who court persecution or the martyr’s death. Such have their reward, a good name among men, but no reward will they get from God. (Luke 16:15) All service rendered to God or to fellow man from an ulterior motive 4s just so much hypocrisy. God hates hypocrisy, and so we are warned against it—Luke 12:1; Rom. 12:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Love expresses itself In unaffected, loyal obedience to God. It does not call attention to itself, but directs all praise and honor to Jehovah God. (Luke 18:19) Those who show such love will be rewarded, because not those who seek honor for themselves, but only those who honor God will he in turn honor, (1 Samuel 2:30) Truly, there is no real self-gain without love.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font29"><a name="bookmark24"></a>The Brutal Assassination of Venezuela’s President</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Await*!&quot; correspondent in Venezuela</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">O</span><span class="font2">N NOVEMBER 13, 1950, Lieutenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Colonel Delgado Chalbaud, president of Venezuela, was shot down in cold blood, marking that land’s first presidential assassination, Fpr two years Chalbaud had ruled Venezuela with two other men as a provisional government</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Led by President Chalbaud, a young man of forty-two years who had been educated as an engineer in France and the United States, his government had been doing things for this country that had never been done before: building housing projects in every important city, installing water systems so that the women would hot have to carry water on their heads for blocks in five-gallon lard pails, putting in a sewerage system and widening pitifully narrow streets and sidewalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lieutenant Colonel Chalbaud thought he had no enemies that would stoop so low a£ to murder him; for that reason he did not have a large bodyguard. Most of the time he only had a motorcycle policeman to assist his chauffeured car through traffic, and frequently he was seen in public with only one other party aside from his chauffeur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the fateful Monday morning, November 13, the president, accompanied by a naval officer, left home in his chauffeured car for his daily trip to the palace. A motorcycle policeman was in the lead. Suddenly, within a short distance of his home, they were forced to stop by twenty men under the leadership of General Rafael Urbina. This ringleader and his associates were primed by an all-night fiesta of drinking in celebration of the brutal murder to follow. They took the chauffeur and motorcycle policeman captive. The naval officer was shot and is yet recovering In the hospital. Then they wounded the president. Not satisfied, they seized him and drove about a mile away to an empty house where the wounded Chalbaud was led Inside. In gangster style they shot him seven times, twice through the head. Five of the shots were fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assassin Urbina was around sixty years old and had been associated with the military government of Gomez’ day. He had always been a rebel and had caused trouble in Aruba a few years ago. It was learned that he had quarreled with Lieutenant Colonel Chalbaud some years previously, and he held a grudge against the president Chalbaud had put him on the government payroll to pacify him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Urbina and his family sought refuge in the consulate of Nicaragua, but in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A neighbor woman had heard the shots and called the police, who gave immediate pursuit The consul of Nicaragua would not give them protection, thus availing their seizure by the police. On the way to prison, Urbina resisted, so the officers reported, and they shot him in the car. The authorities now have caught all the guilty ones and these will be tried later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The military government, fearful at first that the atrocity was the &quot;first shot” of a revolution, ordered a curfew confining everyone to his home from 5 p.m. until 6 am. Sirens whined by day and heavy soldier guards waited out the nights. Finally, the government was satisfied that the assassination found no general public sympathy and marked no popular desire for a change in regimes. Hence, within two weeks the emergency measures were lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A civilian, the former ambassador to Peru, Dr. G. Saures Flamerich, has now been appointed president. He is at present part of the three-man tribunal ruling the country. The citizenry give evidence of satisfaction with the existing government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perhaps some of the shock of this note of violence from Venezuela was absorbed by the tense world situation which has succeeded In making such acts almost commonplace. Governments rise and fall with ominous regularity in a world feeling more painfully than ever in its history the temporary nature of man’s rule.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font26"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Regarding Jamaicans and Crickets</span></h5>
<p><span class="font23">*5? The article <sup>&lt;c</sup>War for Survival Between Man and Insects”, published in the November 8, 1950, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font23"> stated: “Jamaicans enjoy crickets as a delicacy, which recalls the locust diet of John the Baptist.” Quick denial of this came from Jamaica, with requests for our source of information. It is the book </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Destructive and Useful Insects, Their Habits and Control,</span><span class="font23"> by C. L. Metcalf and W- P. Flint, second edition, 1939. In the chapter “The Value of Insects to Man”, on page 54, the statement appears: “The people of Jamaica consider a plate of crickets a compliment to the most distinguished guest,” Whether this viewpoint was held only </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">in times past, or whether it obtained only </span><span class="font23">in limited areas and localities, or just how the differences between this statement and the Jamaican denials are to be resolved, we cannot say at present. However, as a matter of Interest we quote two paragraphs from the book to give the setting of its disputed statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">‘Tn many parts of the world considerable quantities of insects are regularly eaten by human beings. These are generally looked upon as great luxuries by the less civilized races. In Mexico the eggs of certain large aquatic bugs are regularly sold in the city markets. The eggs are about the size of bird shot. The Mexicans sink sheets of matting under water upon which the eggs are laid by millions. These are then dried and placed in -sacks, sold by the pound and used for making cakes. The people of Jamaica consider a plate of crickets a compliment to the most distinguished guest, Ox warbles are eaten raw by the Dog Rib Indians. Natives of Australia collect quantities of the bugong moth, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Agrotis infusa,</span><span class="font23"> in bags, roast them in hot coals, and claim that they taste like nuts and abound in oil. The Indians and semicivilized natives of many countries catch quantities of ants, grasshoppers, and the larvae and pupae of bees, moths, crane flies and woodboring beetles and eat them raw, dried or roasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“From the actions of wild animals and the testimony of those persons who have tried insects as food, it seems that much of this material is palatable. It would, In fact, be difficult to give any sound reasons why we should consume quantities of oysters, crabs and lobsters, and disdain to eat equally clean, palatable, and nutritious insects. Perhaps the economists of the future, if hard pressed to maintain an ever-increasing population, may well turn their attention to the utilization of certain kinds of insects as human food.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Bed China Fights On</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">$&gt; With Chinese communist troops sweeping southward during January, pushing units of eleven U. N. nations back toward the southern tip of Korea, the U.N. “Cease Fine” committee called on China to quit. But the would-be peacemakers failed, for China would not consider quitting while things were going so well her way, at least not until she got her demands for Complete U. N. withdrawal from Korea, control of Formosa, and admission of Red China to the U. N. The U. N., after having branded the North Koreans as aggressors for crossing the 38th parallel in June, was now reluctant to take the same action toward the Chinese Communists, for fear of a war against Communist China that would sap the West’s strength and make it an easy prey for Russia. The U. S. contended that the future of the U. N, depends on its reaction to Red China'* attack, and that the U.N. may crumble unless it brands China as an aggressor. As far as U. N. survival is concerned, the challenge is great, because the Chinese attack on the U, N. army was a far more serious flouting of Its authority than the attack on Ethiopia was to the League of Nations* authority shortly before its fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; President Truman’s &quot;State of the Union” message to Congress (1/8) reflected the prevailing fear of war. He set forth a program to prepare for full mobilization. He ruled out any appeasement of communism, but said, “We are willing, as we always have been, to negotiate honorable settlements with the Soviet Union?’ He advised Europe thst the U. S. would continue furnishing military aid, and called for an annual U. S. production of 50,000 planes and 35,000 tanks. A week later (1/15) he submitted his annual budget, which totaled $71.5 billion, $41.4 billion of which would be for arms, (This totals $477 for each man, woman and child in the U. S3 Truman warned that to pay for mobilization the U. S. would be ‘taxed until it hurts*. Proponents of severe taxation say that it would help restrict inflation by narrowing the gap between the increasing number of dollars available and the decreasing quantity of civilian goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">World War in *51?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; With the world girding for another war, a major question in most minds is whether another major conflict will come in 195L The New York </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font23">reported (1/5) that the U.S. rearmament program is apparently based on the assumption that a general war would not occur in 1951. British and French officials were reported to have similar views. They believed that Russia would continue her Asian expansion and embroil the West deeper in China and Indo-Chlna, but doubted a European war. Assistant U. N. Secretary General David Owen said (1/1) that he believed there would be no outbreak of global war in 1951, although minor conflicts would probably continue. However, none of these opinions were dogmatic, other officials disagreed with them, and time alone will prove whether they were correct in predicting that there would be no world war in 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Court Approves Park Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The right of Jehovah’s witnesses to use public parks for Bible lectures was again upheld by a unanimous decision of the U. S. Supreme Court against Havre de Grace, Maryland (1/15), Nlemotko and Kelley, speakers at a Bible assembly in the public park there, were arrested and convicted of disorderly conduct when they attempted to speak and hold a meeting. The city council had previously denied Jehovah’s witnesses permission to use the park. The court showed that Havre de Grace had no specific regulation for the park’s use. All authority rested uncontrolled by law in the park commissioner and the city council. The court ruled that it was necessary to have a narrowly drawn ordinance with reasonable and definite standards providing for use of the park. The court held that Jehovah’s witnesses were within their rights in holding the meeting without a permit under such conditions. Thus another U. S. Supreme Court decision marks a victory for religious liberty. It was also a vindication of the two speakers and the Havre de Grace congregation of Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">vah’s witnesses who hid been unjustly restrained In their Christian ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Bed &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; Condemned</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; It Is refreshing, in a time when the communlst-scare has reached such proportions that people are fired from their jobs because they have been accused (but not always proved guilty) of former Red associations, to learn of Attorney General J. Howard McGrath's report (1/13) that &quot;we have the Communist fifth column well under control&quot;. He promised there would &quot;be no gesta-po witch hunts&quot;, and warned against Labeling &quot;constructive critics&quot; as disloyal or sub ver* sive, and smearing &quot;every opposition sentiment with the label of communism&quot;. He said that those who would try to &quot;abridge beyond reason our tradition of democratic freedom are as dangerous to American liberties as the Communists themselves&quot; and are playing &quot;directly into the hands of the Kremlin's agents&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTangaments for</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">European Army </span><span class="font23">&gt;&nbsp;What to do about a European army Is a question that has plagued the West and probably will do so in some respects for a long time. Gen. Elsenhower visited the various Atlantic Pact nations in January to get information about their contributions to the army he will Command, while In the U. S. the Democrats and Republicans argued about what part the U.S. should have in it. Some Republicans opposed sending IL S. troops to Europe, and doubted that the president had the authority to send them without Congress’ permission. Truman said they would be sent, and examples of previous presidents were cited to show he had the authority to send them without asking Congress’ permission. The European army seems almost a certainty, but many problems con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">The German War Criminate</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; Now that West Germany may be called on to contribute to the European army, demands for &quot;restoration of the honor of the German soldier’<sup>1 </sup>are increasing. A West German parliamentary committee appealed to U. S. officials (1/9J for amnesty for German war criminals still sentenced to execution. Among the prisoners were SS generals convicted of directing the extermination of 2 million persons. Another German war criminal, 44-year-old Ilse Koch, was sentenced by a German court (1/15) to life imprisonment at hard labor for crimes against Germans In the Buchenwald concentration tamp. (She had previously been sentenced by a U. S. court for crimes against non-Germans.) The court did not find proof for the claims that Inmates had been murdered for their tattooed skin, but expressed no doubt that skin lampshades had been made and human heads shriveled and preserved at the camp. Her attorney said he would appeal to the West German Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Bellgious Education In Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A religious-political squabble over education in Israel brought on the threat of a cabinet crisis and the resignation of Rabbi Judah L. Maimon, minister of religious affairs (1/3). The, crisis was overcome when Premier Ben-Gurion assured Maimon that all children from religious homes, Including immigrants, would automatically get religious education, while the others would choose between secular and religious schools.</span></p>

Medical supplies and 400 tons of rice were sent In to help relieve the suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Aslan Unrest</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">**The old equilibrium has been upset and can never come back again/’ said Prime Minister Nehru of India (1/12) in explaining that Asia emerging from colonial status. It is <sup>&lt;f</sup>no longer prepared to tolerate any domination, or threat of domination, or any behavior after the old pattern of colonialism”. Even the songs are now set to the theme of liberty, according to an explorer who recently visited Asia. &quot;It’s in the air everywhere,&quot; ahe said. &quot;The music is one of the indications of a great tidal wave In Asia.&quot; On poverty and unrest rides the Red tide of communism in Asia, as elsewhere, with its false but lavish promises of land reform and better conditions. Fearing the unrest, some governments are reforming, such as Nepal (which recently had a revolt against its maharajah-prime minister), where the establishment of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font23">more democratic form of government was promised (V7). The French sent a new general to Indo-China to command their crumbling forces fighting against advancing communiat-led Vietminh troops. Tibetan officials believed resistance to the Chinese communists was futile, so they prepared to either negotiate with the communists or flee to India. But the Asians will find that neither colonialism, communism, nor self-rule will bring desirable conditions. Along with the rest of the world, their only hope is in the blessings of</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">A Few Facts About 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In the U. S. In 1950 over $3 billion was spent on the &quot;Cold War” against communism. There were more strikes, but they Involved fewer people and took fewer man hours. Unionized workers won more than $2 billion in yearly wage Increases, but taxes and inflation ate up much of their gates. U.S. autolsts drove 450 btillon miles. The number of telephones in the U.S, increased by 2 million, to a total of 35,400,000. And U.S. consumers concluded the year over $20 billion In debt, principally for autos, television and home appliances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Food—-a Possible Poison</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even in this day of cutthroat commercial practices, it is shocking to learn that insecticides, preservatives, &quot;softeners” and the like that are used in the food we buy may be gradually poisoning us. A report from food Investigators in the House of Representatives in Washington says that of 704 chemicals being added to foods in the U. S. &quot;only 428 are definitely known to be safe as used&quot;. This means, the report said, that &quot;there are approximately 276 chemicals being used in food today, the safety of which has not been established to the satisfaction of the Food and Drug Administration and many other groups concerned with the health and safety of the public”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t Be ‘Victim X”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; Sometime between now and the end of 1951 some American may become &quot;Victim X”. A child playing In the street, a speeding motorist, or a careless pedestrian may receive this doubtful honor, for &quot;Victim X&quot; will be the mCHonth person to die from auto accidents In the U.S. since 1900. (Fourteen states have less than a million population.) &quot;Victim X” may read these words; but remember, the careful driver and cautious pedestrian stand a good chance of not being, or causing, &quot;Victim X.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Would Swap OU for Water</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">&lt;$&gt; It Is human nature to want what you do not have. For example, most people would like an oil well in their back yard, yet when the town of Cabot, Arkansas, had oil flowing from kitchen and bathroom taps (1/5), everyone wished it was water. &quot;Every time we drill for water we get gas or oil,” said the mayor of this town that has dug five wells in five years, each of which started producing gas or oil sooner or later. It is just human nature to want what you do not have.</span></p>

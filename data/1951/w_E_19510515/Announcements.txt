“PURE LANGUAGE” TESTIMONY PERIOD
There is only one pure language among the thousands spoken today. It is the pure language of truth, God’s Word. Almighty God provided it for all peoples of many nationalities. To enable many to learn this pure language, the month of June has been set aside as the “Pure Language” Testimony Period. (Zeph. 3:9) Now is the time for this pure language to be made known to all life seekers; so why not take it up, speak it forth, and help others to learn it and live? Offering them the book “This Means Everlasting Life” and a 32-page booklet, on a contribution of 35c, makes this simple and easy to accomplish. Unite with Jehovah’s! witnesses in this educational campaign. Then report your activity and add it to this world-wide work during this period, all to the honor of the Creator.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“WAY OF SUCCESS” TESTIMONY PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Diligently the world seeks for success. But to no avail, for it strives for fleeting, superficial things, for selfish gain. Actually success is measured in terms of living, life in happiness for all eternity to come. That is real success. But how does one get it? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 1:7, 8</a> discloses the formula for success: loyal obedience to the Creator, Jehovah God, studying his Word, the Bible, meditating on it and then keeping it on our tongues by discussing it with others and informing them of it for their guidance to success. During the month of October, this sure way of success will be made clear to many thousands of lovers of righteousness by offering a subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine for 1 year and 3 booklets, at the regular rate of $1.00. Prosperity not only for the reader but also for others is assured by gaining and then applying the information contained in that magazine. Write to us for further information and assistance.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WASHINGTON CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Society is planning to hold a convention in Washington, D. C., October 12, 13 and 14. The place will be Griffith Stadium, the home of the Washington American League Baseball Club. A number of the brothers that are attending the European conventions will be back by that time and the talks delivered at London will be given in Washington, including the public talk, “Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?” by the president of the Society. Announcements concerning the rooming committee address and how you can obtain rooming accommodations will appear in the <em>Informant</em>. For your information, the stadium is an open-air assembly place, and evenings in October will be cool. So you can arrange accordingly as to what you believe you will need in the way of wearing apparel. We feel sure the assembly will be as interesting as the one in London and as upbuilding as our recent district assemblies in the United States. Those who can arrange to attend should do their planning now.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If forced to explain any number of worldly ceremonies taken for granted but never investigated, many would find themselves in the state described by the above title. It proved a fitting caption for an item appearing in the London <em>Catholic Herald </em>of April 14, 1950, in reference to such a ceremony in the midst of this world’s political upheaval. The item follows:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A letter received in Hong Kong from a village in Communist-held China tells of an odd ceremony at the opening of a new term at the little Catholic school. The Communist flag was hung on the classroom wall. Then a large holy picture was hung in front of it. Three bows were made to the flag—and three to the holy picture. The new national anthem was sung, followed by three <em>Hail Marys</em>. A Communist official made a speech, and then came a talk by the Catholic teacher. Finally ‘God bless China’ rang out amidst the traditional burst of fireworks.”</p>

Circuit Assembly in Nigeria
Great rejoicing came from the fact that six persons, as a result of the assembly, shook off the shackles of religion and came into the Lord’s organization. During Saturday’s service the witnesses called upon certain juju worshipers. These people soon saw the folly of their religious practices and were convinced by the simple Bible truths. Sunday morning the witnesses called back on these people. “What shall we do with our jujus [fetishes]?” they asked. “Destroy them!” came the reply. “Will you assist?” “Gladly!” In true Gideon fashion a group of witnesses began removing the jujus out of their places. There was great commotion. Neighbors quickly gathered. Some protested, others selfishly wanted to salvage the trinkets from these fetish objects. But the witnesses were determined to do a thorough job. One witness answered the religious neighbors in the words of Gideon’s father, “If the jujus are gods, let them now fight and save themselves.” How helpless they were! The witnesses dumped all the trash into a canoe, rowed out to the center of the river and junked the jujus into a watery grave. Gone and perished forever! But the people of good will who once served them rejoice in the hope of living forever.—Nigeria branch office.

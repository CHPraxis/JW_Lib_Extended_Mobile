<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the book of life-giving knowledge, the Bible, is to be found this admonition: “Continue in the things you learned.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) The servants of the Almighty God, Jehovah, have learned from this source of knowledge the truths so vitally necessary to one’s gaining life. They have studied these truths and now want to unselfishly aid others to learn of this knowledge. During the month of July these faithful servants will offer to others this information by means of the book <em>“This Means Everlasting Life”, </em>together with a self-covered booklet. If you have learned these truths and are now happy in them, why not work along with Jehovah’s witnesses? Associate with others who are continuing in these same things and then report your activities to the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, or send it to the Watchtower. A contribution of 35c is asked for the above combination of book and booklet.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">From August 4 to August 19 inclusive the Bethel home, offices and factory printing plant will be closed down to give the family a rest period.

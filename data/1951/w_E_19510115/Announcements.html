<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“MAKE KNOWN THE GOOD NEWS” TESTIMONY PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While serving as an ambassador of the government of God, the apostle Paul was bound in chains by those who opposed the truth. Rather than be silenced, however, Paul prayed that he might open his mouth “with all freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:19-49:6:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 6:19</a>, NW) Jehovah’s witnesses, who serve similarly as ambassadors of the Theocracy in this day, follow Paul’s example and have selected “Make Known the Good News” as the theme for their activity during February. Their offer will be a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>at the yearly rate of $1, with three booklets (<em>Evolution versus The New World, Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth? </em>and any other self-covered booklet) given free to each new subscriber. <em>The Watchtower </em>magazine has long been foremost in bringing the good news of the Kingdom to men of good will. Would you not like to join in this beneficial activity? A letter to us, or an inquiry directed to the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, will bring you any instruction you may require, together with forms for obtaining subscriptions and reporting what you accomplish. Why not grasp this opportunity to “make known the good news” to your neighbors and friends?</p>

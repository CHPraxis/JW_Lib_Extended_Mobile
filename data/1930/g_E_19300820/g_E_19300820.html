Y., Wednesday, August 20, 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 285</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Drug Traffic</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE traffic in habit-forming drugs has grown to enormous proportions all over the world. The use of heroin, a derivative of opium, began about 1917. At that time the offenses against the United States narcotic laws were about 1,000 a year; in 1919 they had reached a total of 2,000 a year; in 1921 they passed 4,000; in 1926 they had passed 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than half of all the prisoners in the prisons of New York city are narcotic cases: 95 percent of these are youthful heroin addicts. In 1917 the number of persons in Federal prisons for violations of the law against narcotic drugs was 299; in 1927 it was 2,116, or more than seven times as large. Drug addicts in the United States are estimated at all the way from 100,000 (the government estimate) to 4,000,000, forty times as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The latter estimate was by Dr. I. C. Hollinger, of Newburg, Indiana, in a paper read at the Hotel Roosevelt, New York, before </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> committee of the World Conference on Narcotic Education, and the International Narcotic Education Association. Incidentally, in his address, Doctor Hollinger stated that the majority of dope users are far above the average in education and intelligence, and that the evil permeates the learned professions and lovely womanhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the dope rings in the one city of Chicago revealed 18,000 drug addicts among the customers, involving yearly payments of $39,000,000. On this and other evidence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation </span><span class="font6">estimates that there are about 1,000,000 addicts in the United States. Mrs. Harry Harvey Thomas, president of the New York City Federation of Women’s Clubs, makes the same estimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is manifestly difficult to get any accurate figures on the subject. The government’s own figures differ. The experts in the Treasury Department estimate the number at 100,000; but Dr. W. P. Treadway, of the United States Public Health Service, in an address at Toronto, only last fall, estimated the number at 200,000. The government claims that the narcotic evil, from an underworld standpoint, and as a public menace, is very perceptibly decreasing.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Tons of Morphine Used</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Alfredo Blanco, of Spain, authority on the international drug traffic, attached as an expert to the League of Nations, states that while the world .production of opium is now 8,600 tons annually, only 786 tons, or less than 10 percent, is needed for medical purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have seen the statement that one ton of opium would be sufficient for the medical needs of America from Alaska to Patagonia, yet in the first ten months of 1919 the United States imported 250 tons of crude opium, enough to produce 35 tons of morphine. This was ten times the amount imported by Germany, France and Italy combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chemical discoveries add tons of narcotics to the world’s supply every year. At present all the big chemical factories are changing morphine into codeine, which circulates freely among all countries. Germany makes twenty tons of morphine a year and turns fourteen tons of it into codeine. Of the world production of sixty tons of morphine, half is turned into codeine, and goes everywhere, taking ruin wherever it goes. We understand that codeine and dionyl or dipropionyl morphine are one and the same thing, and that morphine in this form is now wrecking Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Progress in synthetic discovery is very rapid, since the World War, and is believed certain to result soon in the discovery of new habit-forming narcotic drugs more powerful and more menacing even than heroin. This places the human race in the midst of a new environment for which it is not adapted and in which it would surely perish without God’s help.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Drug Addicts Irresponsible</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Drug addicts are irresponsible. The hold which habit-forming drugs have upon, their victims is such that they will stop at nothing to obtain the $5 to $8 a day which they must have in order to satisfy their cravings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of nineteen persons arrested in Boston at one time for violation of the narcotic law a careful oversight was kept for one year. During that time, one was convicted of murder in the second degree, one of robbery, and each of seven served six months in prison. At the end of the second year, all but two of the nineteen were serving prison sentences; and those two had just been released from a penal institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most horrible feature of the drug habit is the fascination that one drug addict finds in fastening the habit on another. In numerous instances mothers make addicts of their children. In one family, where both the father and mother were addicts and dope peddlers, four children, ranging in ages from a baby of two years to a child of twelve years, were all drug addicts. An Italian dope peddler in New York had taught his eight-year-old stepson to use heroin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A case is on record of a girl addicted to the use of drugs who was made so by her chum, who could no longer procure the drug cheaply, and hoped, by making her roommate an addict, to procure the drug at a lower cost. The risks of selling the drug are so great that the dope peddlers raise the price as soon as they are convinced that the user has become a confirmed addict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A policewoman of New York remarked that, in addition to the contamination of others so that assistance may be had in gaining even for a little time the benefit of a lower price, there is a moral lechery in the minds of addicts which makes them wish to ruin others. She said on this subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a marked peculiarity of the addict. Nearly every one of them, after reaching a certain stage, finds complete satisfaction only in fastening the habit on someone else. And oftentimes the victim is a friend or loved one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So true is this that the dope peddlers have a habit of saying, “Every new hop-head is good for six more hops.” These men, mostly addicts themselves, display the igenuity of the Devil in creating drug users, so as to widen and increase their business. They deliberately tempt the victim, frequently some young girl or boy, offering a box of heroin to snuff, or passing it around at a party, in the certain knowledge that when the habit is acquired here is another human creature that will stop at no crime to get , -the daily supply of $5 to $8 worth of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Single Cause of Crime &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With more than eleven thousand murders a year in this country, and less than a hundred executions for them, it becomes a matter of moment to identify drugs as the greatest single cause of crime, yet that is the charge of Senator Wm. L. Love, M.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first effects of the drug increase selfesteem in a superlative degree, along with destructiveness and combativeness, at the same time deadening the qualities of judgment, caution, pity and honesty, which exist in the upper part of the brain. Selfishness becomes the only ... god. It is a means by which people in the lower............</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">walks of life can become as cruel and mercenary and heartless as the apostles- of Big Business. Moreover, as in the game of Big Business, there are enormous profits to be made by those that .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">have no conscience and are vailing to plunder and ruin their fellow men. Are all the public utility magnates dope fiends? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A checkup at the federal penitentiary on McNeil’s Island showed 56 prisoners to be bootleggers, and 896 drug peddlers. Most of the boys and nearly all of the girls living in the underworld have come down by the drug route. Many first offenders become drug addicts while serving prison sentences and thereafter become habitual criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Narcotics are soluble in fat and therefore readily find access to the delicate, highly organized gray matter of the brain and the equally delicate and carefully protected organs of reproduction, impairing the sexual power of the ’ male and causing the female to become sterile and conscienceless. The elements of virtue crumble in a few months. Last year, 75,000 girls disappeared, an increase of 50 percent in the......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">estimate for the previous yearn. The economic burden of the drug addict is set at $5,000,000,- . ..... 000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Crime i s on the increase in Paris, the number of murders, thefts and other serious crimes last year having beaten all previous records. This increase is charged to the spread of the use of narcotics. During the year eleven opium dens were discovered and 223 kilos of opium, cocaine, morphine and hashish were collected by police inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persons familiar with the drug habit declare that several airplane accidents which were charged to the weather were really due to the fact that the pilots, knowing that in going up in bad weather they were taking extra hazards, overdosed themselves with drugs and lost their usual good judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Treadway, of the United States Health Service, heretofore quoted, attributes 70 percent of the narcotic cases to bad associations, the victim being led into the use of narcotics by other addicts or by example or by experiment; 20 percent acquire the habit to allay pain; 5 percent resort to drugs because of overwork and the search for thrills; 5 percent are unclassified.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Course of Ruin</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The most devilish of all the drugs seems to be heroin, the one that is specially used to lure girls from the path of virtue. It has the property of producing temporary sex insanity, which is later followed by complete sex atrophy, the pitiable condition of millions of British subjects in India, directly due to Britain’s policy of subjugating them by opium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heroin is the drug that was used some years ago in forming among schoolboys and schoolgirls a secret society, exposed at the time. Thousands of boys and girls were initiated into this society; and thereafter boys and girls displayed badges openly, pinned upon their breasts or coat lapels, thus signifying their right to approach others wearing similar badges, or to be approached by them, for sex purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one New England town 20,000 boys and girls, so a reputable Christian physician told us, were found wearing these badges before the police discovered their significance; and the badges were selling so rapidly that the makers could hardly keep pace with the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor are the dainty cigarettes in their dainty cases as mild and innocent as the cigarettesmoking young ladies would have us believe. They have in their mixture a poison called furfural, the “kick” from which is equal to two ounces of whiskey to every cigarette. This not only increases the desire for cigarettes, but makes confirmed “dope” addicts of their users. Thousands of young girls in cities and small towns have the habit, and the menace among high school girls is an ever increasing problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With a brain-drugged consciousness at a time in life when the young maiden needs to have her mind exercised to the highest moral standards, with no sense of duty to God or man, and often free from the uplifting influence of home and parents, she becomes an easy victim for the downward path, the end whereof is in plain sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Drugs Most Commonly Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the habit-forming drugs, opium, morphine and heroin are all derived from the opium poppy ; hashish, or cannibus indica, is derived from hemp; cocaine is derived from the coca leaf. Besides these, there are the drugs chloral, ether, arsenic, trional, sulfonal, veronal, paraldehyde and aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Pop, what is this white powder the kids are buying and selling? They say it is great jazz medicine,” was the first inkling that one citizen of New York had that the heroin curse was spreading among the school children. In a single year in New York nine children from twelve to fourteen years of age were arrested for selling heroin to other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three drugs in most general use are heroin, morphine and cocaine, in the order named, the first two coming from the opium P<sup>0</sup>PPy- Opium itself is a brownish substance, resembling hardened molasses. Hashish, an extract of hemp, is of about the consistency of syrup, dark green in color, bitter in taste, and sometimes sold in the form of cigarettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Oklahoma a man gave a hashish cigarette to a police officer, putting the policeman to sleep and allowing soihe of the prisoners in the jail to escape. This is merely a sample of the cleverness that drug addicts exhibit in outmaneuver-ing the apostles of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Morphine, after a few doses, produces loss of appetite, headaches and general dullness. Ideas of duty and right relations to others become obscure. The margin between truth and falsehood becomes more and more cloudy. The power of analysis disappears. The brain does not receive accurate information, and it can no longer discriminate and act wisely. It forgets to carry out promises; it is suspicious, credulous, full of intrigue and deception. Most users of morphine die in ten years, while others live on a little longer, if there are breaks in its use; but fifteen years is about the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cocaine is even more dangerous than morphine, and indeed is the most dangerous of all the habit-forming drugs. Once it has become a habit, permanent cures are almost unknown. A dose causes exhilaration, mental activity and a general sense of well-being. After the effects have worn off, depression follows. Then another dose is necessary, and another, and still another. When the syNem will stand no more the victim falls insensible or becomes hysterical. Cocaine acts upon the heart, and stimulates the brain; pain and distress disappear, and the cocainist is at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When denied the drug the victim is excitable, melancholy, worried, unable to sleep, and generally miserable, and, if he is unable to procure the cocaine, will resort to any drug procurable for relief. But with cocainomaniacs there is no substitute for the drug. They are literally insane until they can procure it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One-eighth of a grain of “dope” will put a normal person to sleep for many hours. An addict will use from fifteen to thirty grains a day, the average addict using about an ounce a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pandemonium of the Mind</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">De Quincy’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions of an Opium Eater </span><span class="font6">has long been a classic on the subject of the disordered condition of the opium user’s mind. De Quincy took no fewer than 340 grains of opium a day, an astounding dose, which accounts to some extent for the fact that not all of his experiences seem to have been duplicated by later victims. AVe quote a few sentences from his work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The worst pandemonium which those who indulge in opium suffer, is that of the mind. Opium retains at all times its power of exciting the imagination, provided sufficient doses are taken; but when it has been continued so long as to bring disease upon the constitution, the pleasurable feelings wear away, and are succeeded by others of a very different kind. Instead of disposing the mind to be happy, it acts upon it like the spell of a demon, and calls up phantoms of horror and disgust. The fancy, still as powerful, changes its direction. Formerly it clothed all objects ■with the light of heaven; now it invests them ■with the attributes of hell. Goblins, spectres, and every kind of distempered vision haunt the mind, peopling it with dreary and revolting imagery. The sleep is no longer cheered with its former sights of happiness. Frightful dreams usurp their place, till at last the person becomes the victim of an almost perpetual misery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opium-eater loses none of his moral sensibilities or aspirations: he wishes and longs as earnestly ac</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ever to realize what he believes possible, and feels to be exacted by duty; but his intellectual apprehension ; of what is possible infinitely outruns his power, not...........</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of execution only, but even of proposing or willing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He lives under a world’s weight of incubus and night- &nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">mare: he lies in sight of all he would fain perform, i just as a man forcibly confined to his bed by the mor-tai languor of paralysis, who is compelled to witness injury or outrage offered to some object of his tender- \ est love; he would lay down his life if he might but rise and walk, but he is powerless as an infant, and ■ cannot so much as make an effort to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A more modern picture of a morphine user’s i mental condition was given in a tale which appeared in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Journal.</span><span class="font6"> It is ' the story of a most unfortunate and unhappy woman. We will let her tell it in her own language:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">I contracted the drug habit—morphine habit. No one -in the world could have been more horrified or . shocked than I was when I discovered that I was ad- ■ dieted to morphine. I am a widow with a little family <sub>: </sub>to care for. ... I had always looked upon people who ■ were the victims of habits as weak, unworthy, unsta-&lt;- ' ble persons who enjoyed their habits, otherwise they ■ would not persist in the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;........</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The horror of it all dawned upon me one week-end : -when I had felt that I must cease taking the medicine, as I needed it no longer. I went to my home without my usual supply, and was far away from where I procured it. .And what was my great surprise to find that I was stricken almost helpless and suffering the tortures of hell, or worse, really, for want of my medicine. I could not believe it—that I, the strong-willed scoffer at other people’s habits, was myself the victim &nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font4">of a habit. What I suffered I never can tell you; or</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font4">how I lived through the week-end until I could get to</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font4">the source of my supply and fall in the door of the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark15"><span class="font4">drug store in a state of collapse more dead than alive.......-from the sudden deprivation of my usual dose of</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font4">medicine.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">I went to the physician who had prescribed it, and <sup>: </sup>on my knees begged him to cure me. He honestly told.......T........</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">me that no cure had ever been found for morphine, f~ addiction, and that the only thing he could do was to ■ . . . keep me apparently normal by supplying my ■ needs physically for the drug. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I would not believe it. I was determined to find a &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup>......</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font4">cure. I waited until my vacation, taking in the mean-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font4">time just as little of the drug as would keep mo</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">mentally and physically balanced, For without it I &nbsp;&nbsp;,.....</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font4">could do no work, was a nervous shaking wreck that</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">could not appear even decently before my employer and business companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So to keep in the semblance of normality I had to ____</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">take it until I could find help. At vacation time I ■ walked from one end of the city to the other, in and put of physicians’ offices, begging for a cure. I was laughed at, taunted, sneered at, called a ‘dope fiend’ and almost thrown out of reputable, high-class physicians’ offices who would not and could not help me. I made up my mind to cease of my own accord. I tried it. I went without it until I fell on the streets; I was taken to my home, nearly collapsed entirely with a heart attack from the sudden withdrawal of the drug, and the physician who was called by my family saw the situation and gave me morphine to steady me for the time being; and for many days I lay too weak to care what could happen to me, weak but glad to be normal again, as I could only be under the influence of the drug of my addiction.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Agonies of ike Drug Sufferers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Drug addicts do not suffer while they are contracting the habit. The suffering comes when they try to break away from it. The agonies of an addict when his supply is exhausted passes the power of human speech to describe. The pains are said to be like a sword thrust through the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Household furniture has been hastily sold at two cents on the dollar of valuation just before the expected visit of the dope peddler. Demons appear before the eyes. At a convention of the California Anti-Narcotic League held in Los Angeles two women, in tears, told of their horrible sufferings when they began to do without the drugs to which they were addicted; and another fell to the floor in a faint when she began to try to put it in words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In another instance the mere thinking of what she had suffered caused one woman to faint and fall into a profound coma. In advanced cases the results of deprivation of the drug of addiction, called “withdrawal symptoms”, are considered the most acute tortures ever endured by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The drug of addiction will quickly relieve this torture, and hence the addict comes to feel that the getting of his supply of the drug is a matter of life and death. The mental sufferings and anguish are commensurate with the physical sufferings. The fear of having to endure the pains of “withdrawal symptoms” makes the addict a perfect slave to a perfectly heartless master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A normal person cannot possibly appreciate the anguish of mind that comes to an addict as he sees his own helplessness and realizes that his morals and principles and even his body are disintegrating, causing untold suffering to his family and friends, and the scorn and hate of society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no cure for drug addiction. Narcosan was given a thorough trial on 318 cases in Bellevue ^Hospital, but it was found that it did not alleviate the withdrawal symptoms, but aggravated some of them, and that following its use there was no obliteration of the craving for narcotics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abrupt withdrawal of the drug of addiction is dangerous to patients and has been known even to cause death. A gradual withdrawal over a period of fourteen days is considered the most efficacious and humane means of helping one to break the habit. Many cures supposed to have been effected have turned out to be not permanent. Men have several times asked magistrates to commit them to prison for a term of years, in order to free themselves from this embrace of a living death.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Opinion of an Expert</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> first took up this study, a visit was made to the office of Dr. Simon, head of the New York Narcotic Squad. The doctor showed pictures of men and women before and after their deterioration. Sad indeed were the changes revealed. The drugs had done their deadly work, and there was change enough wrought in some of the faces in a period of three years to mar the countenances so completely that they -were scarcely recognizable as the same individuals. Doctor Simon said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the user of morphine the pupils are contracted; in the user of cocaine and heroin the pupils are dilated. If one starts to question an addict a small bead-like perspiration will break out on the upper lip. When they have- the desire for the drug, the “yen”, they travel at a very rapid pace. After they have procured the drug they still travel at a very rapid pace, with, one hand in the coat pocket, holding the drug and ready to scatter it to the winds or into a pool if a detective happens along. A detective can tell from the appearance and movements of an addict when he is on the way for his drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is nothing in criminal history more alienating, more socially deteriorating, more damning or more malignant than narcotic drugs. A man may take a drink of whisky daily for ten days and not emerge a drunkard. But a man who takes narcotics daily for ten days, unless he be suffering from a particular disease, will become a drug addict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no man but will, through the slavery of drugs, slowly but surely, and ultimately, be in tire gutter. Narcotic drugs suck the soul into ths very depths of hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A drug like cocaine produces mental changes that will make a thief, or possibly a murderer. With varied hallucinations, delusions or mental aberrations, it is not remarkable that the arrant coward under its influence may become a desperado.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cure of drug addicts is adequate, but not ideal. Colonies should be organized where drug addicts can be taken after they leave the institutional hospitals, The reason that many of them go back is that they are usually down to their last cent. They have used their last penny for drugs; they are without work, sometimes without clothes, except the few rags which are often insufficient to cover them. No provision being made for them after they leave the hospital, they are tempted to return to their old environment; and when they do, they are almost certain to return to the use of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An addict is medically cured in a week or ten days; that is, he has no further bodily need for the drug. But the mental craving for it persists. The drug addict must be spiritually built up. Their desire for cure must come from the heart. There is where the real cure must come; and there is where there is a great need for welfare bodies who will secure positions for addicts on farms or camps where they are away from the old environment until they can overcome the mental craving for the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the drug addicts have mentally and morally deteriorated. We have had bank presidents go to the gutter from the use of drugs. The addicts sacrifice food to such an extent in order to satisfy their cravings that when they take the drug cure they not infrequently gain thirty to eighty pounds of flesh in one week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dope Peddlers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font6"> woman peddler hid in the collar of her dog, which always accompanied her on her walks, the drugs which she dispensed to her customers. Inmates of the penitentiary on Blackwell’s Island were supplied with drugs by heroin and morphine pressed into letter paper with a hot iron. The prisoner chewed the paper, and thus obtained the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An Italian gentleman, given a seven-year ride to Sing Sing for his proficiency, had an artificial left arm which was hollow from the wrist to the elbow. In the wrist was a small door with a spring, which. he could open for the removal of packages of cocaine. There were two compartments in the arm, one containing ten packages and the other twenty packages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the lower part of a platform scale in a Bowery restaurant $1,000 worth of the drugs was found by the police. $2,000,000 worth was seized as it was about to be put on board the Twentieth Century Limited in the Grand Central Terminal. A suspect arrested in New York boasted that he had a secret factory in New Jersey and could fill an order for $2,000,000 worth in twenty-four hours, and that he had no fear of the law &quot;because he was too well protected’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fashionable summer resorts are favorite gathering places for dope peddlers and dope users. This is true of the Riviera, Marseilles and Toulon. One of the hotel proprietors in Atlantic City fitted up an entire floor of his hotel with pipes for opium smoking and eots for the addicts. He was sent to Atlanta penitentiary for fifteen months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is hard to catch the most intelligent of the peddlers. The police knew for months that Arnold Rothstein was at the head of a great dope ring, but as he was not an addict it was hard for them to definitely connect him with the traffic until after he was murdered and identifying documents were found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dope Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the peddlers discovered in New’ York had a route as definite as that of a milkman. Beginning at six every morning he made his rounds of fashionable apartment houses, leaving three decks of cocaine here, a phial ef morphine there, half a dozen decks of heroin at the next place. Sometimes, his books showed, he was called on to supply additional opium or heroin for a party, just as a caterer might supply dinners for a &quot;wedding. On several occasions he supplied experts to cook opium for a patron who wanted to treat his guests to a smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At examination time the peddlers hang around high schools, where nervous children are unstrung by the fear of failure in the arduous and useless examinations. Just at the time when, the tension is at the maximum the peddler comes along with his heroin and cocaine in a closed automobile; and the children buy, even though the dope peddlers know in advance that the sure end is a horrible death within about ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Boys are often hired as watchers for dope peddlers, and later become addicts and peddlers themselves. Soothing syrups for babies constitute a common form by which the habit is inculcated without the victim’s being aware. Rich and poor, sages and knaves, from every walk of life they come, and from every grade of mentality, to become slaves, to be ruined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doctor Simon’s lieutenant, Mr. Donoghue, describing the difficulty attendant upon the apprehension of a dope peddler, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Someone will call up here and tell us that they are peddling such and such a drug at such and such a corner, and ask us why we do not arrest them. Why? Because we have to buy the drug from a peddler before we can convict him. for the reason that no court will take the word of an addict who might be called as a witness. So the. members of the police force are compelled to act as addicts and actually purchase the drug themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The detective makes up as an addict. [The writer saw a photograph of one of these makeups that was perfect, and turning around he beheld the detective himself. No one would have recognized him for the same individual, I am sure.] He hangs around with a gang of addicts until he can learn from them where to purchase the drug. Often the addict is suspicious; but when he is reassured, he will tell where to get the drug. The peddler is approached and asked for a “deck of C” or a “deck of II,” or whatever drug he wants. The dope peddler, too, is skeptical and often holds out for several days before he will sell the drug. Finally he asks to see the money. He takes enough to cover the cost of the amount to be purchased and then tells the detective, disguised as an addict, to meet him at a point several blocks beyond where the sale was contracted. While the ‘addict’ is waiting, someone, often nof the person who made the sale, will come along, slip something into his hand, and is off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Drug Boosters</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Drug boosters are used to help inform drug addicts where to get the drugs, and drug vendors where they can find markets. The drug booster thus receives a double commission, one from the vendor and one from the purchaser. This makes his business highly profitable and very safe, as it is difficult to convict the drug booster. How the drug booster makes new addicts was told by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> writer in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The narcotic division finds the “drug booster” in all sorts of places, but recently he or she has been frequenting the white light district.- In Broadway restaurants and dance places, from “ham-and” joints to the most expensive lobster palaces, this agent is doing a profitable business. Often he is found at a table, and sometimes through introductions, sometimes through girls who are working for him, suggests to his intended customer a midnight party somewhere, promising something unusual or “bohemian” in this party. A promise of some bootleg whiskey is often the bait; a place where sure tips on the races can be obtained is another glittering attraction offered. Sometimes when the booster feels it is safe he promises his new-found friend a real “dope” party, at which they will be merely witnesses, not touching the drug themselves at ail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then from the restaurant the party, with two or three prospective and unwitting customers, goes to a room somewhere in the vicinity. If the party is supposed to be “bohemian” the room may be on the lower East Side, and the new crowd is introduced to those who have the stuff. They are treated to an exhibition of “hop” smoking, and watch the effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the time is ripe to get them. They are asked to “try it once just to see what it is like”, and often they do. Perhaps the effects are not as wonderful as they are anticipated to be: but generally on another night they allow themselves to be persuaded to try another pipe to see if the second may not go better than the first, and then the curious pleasure-seeker is almost surely hooked. Before he knows it drugtaking is a pleasure to him, and then a necessity: and another drug addict is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In another issue the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the form of a powder heroin is sprinkled upon the wrist, and young persons are invited, sometimes dared, to sniff it. In that manner the dangerous drug is supplied at “snow parties” and soon boys and girls become hopeless addicts. Usually the victims are picked from the higher strata of society because it is the ultimate aim of the illicit drug peddlers to enslave youth who arc able to pay dearly for the drug. At first it is supplied gratis. Then the peddlers raise their prices for the dose as the craving and capacity of the addict are increased from a fifteenth of a grain sometimes to as much as 100 grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> said further of the drug booster:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes he distributes free samples, sometimes he enslaves a number of girls and spreads the habit through them all over a factory or store. He and his assistants work on a commission basis. He is the successor to the cadet or procurer of the white-slave traffic: for he finds he can use girls more profitably in peddling drugs than in other forms of vice. Dance hall habitues number many drug boosters: others pose as chorus girls. If their customers are of the higher planes of society they seldom fall within the clutches of the police, because there is enough money available to buy the drug without resorting to crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">One of the Curses of the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been circulated widely the theory that the increased use of drugs in the United States since the World War is clue to prohibition. This theory may contain a measure of truth, but it is discounted by the fact that the increase in consumption of drugs and narcotics is just as great in European countries, where there is no limitation on beverages, and by the further fact that the majority of drug addicts were not previously users of alcohol. A statement of the Treasury Department, denying that prohibition is the cause, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The. truth is that victims of the drug habit practically in every instance are young men and women, often in their teens. Rarely are they alcoholics. The difference between a drug addict and an alcoholic is that the alcoholic, after a “spree”, usually is sorry and, repenting, experiences a period of reform. The drug addict has no such experience. Once a victim, there is rarely any cessation. The disease is rarely curable, and even when the body is cured the mental craving continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the World War itself wrought immeasurable havoc. Suffering from cold, hunger, rain-soaked trenches, homesickness, and many other causes, or lingering on beds of pain in hospitals where physicians and attendants were too scarce to give them proper attention and relief, many of the boys sought relief from their ills through narcotic drugs. They were relieved by the hypodermic needle day after day and week after week until, instead of forgetfulness and cure, they were the slaves of a habit a thousandfold worse than the disease or even death itself could have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We get further light on the damage wrought by drugs during the World War from the following report by Miss Rujaro, for three years •with the California State Committee on Readjustment :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was part of my duties to meet and help the returning boys who had gone to Siberia to wage the so-called “war” on Russia. At first I thought my work would be to aid them in getting back into their old jobs, in straightening out their allotment tangles, and in helping them in a hundred other little ways; but I soon found out there was a more serious help to be offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sane, patriotic American citizens will scarcely believe it possible—at first I could scarcely believe it myself—that this more serious help was to be the care of narcotic addicts—boys who had gone “over there” to the frozen land “clean” and who had come back not maimed by shot and shell from Bolshevik guns, but torn in nerves, with health shattered, with hope almost gone, because they had fallen victims to an iniquitous “drug ring”, the directing heads of which are Americans—I should say American traitors—and whose field “workers” in Siberia were their Jap agents, whose chief employment is to receive “exported drugs” for the purpose of smuggling them back into the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From many of the boys I learned that it was no uncommon experience to have American manufactured morphine, cocaine, and heroin daily offered to them while on duty in Vladivostok and the Russian hinterland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Suffering from homesickness, fighting a “war” of which they knew neither the aim nor the reason, or idle in camps in the limitless snow wastes, some of the brave lads yielded to the temptation that promised them “freedom from worry and care”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those lads came back slaves. There were numbers of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dope-selling Doctors</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mere fact that the pharmaceutical companies obtain, through the offices of the United States and British governments, many times as much opium as America could possibly legitimately consume proves that the medical frater-_____________</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nities which these pharmaceutical companies---------------</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">control have a large responsibility in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many times doctors allow their sympathies to get the better of their sense when dealing with patients who are suffering from painful diseases, and by dealing out dope of one kind or f another it is an easy matter to fasten a habit upon an innocent victim before either the doctor or the victim is aware of what is taking place. Dr. Blair, writing in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Survey,</span><span class="font6"> makes the following charges:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After thirty years of medical practice, it comes as a distinct shock to be obliged to admit that the narcotic evil must be largely laid at the feet of my own profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The writer has figured the matter up and down, across and back again; he has estimated available supplies and where they go in regular trade; he is in a . position to know with fair accuracy how much narcotic drugs are used in professional channels; he has investigated intimately the industrial situation, and he lias visited the large proprietary medicine plants throughout the Union. The result is that he is, with infinite regret, compelled to admit that the dope-selling professional man is the main narcotic menace in this country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are peddlers of narcotic in all of our large cities and in some of the smaller ones; but there are dope-selling professional men in nearly every community, and in the aggregate they vastly outnumber .... the peddlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The narcotic laws must be enforced in the full recognition of the fact that professional people are responsible for a large proportion of drug addiction. The great body of ethical and capable professional people must join in the crusade against the phygi- . cian, dentist, or druggist who is catering to narcotic addiction. They owe it to the public to do so, and they owe it to the professions of which they are members to run to earth the degenerates therein who are trafficking in human weakness and vicious habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are several classes of medical dope-sellers. The most troublesome and the most hopeless one is the medical man or woman who is addicted to the personal use of large quantities of narcotics and who is gradually going down the slope. There are many, many such, and they are found among the high and the low in professional circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then there is the obsessed, ignorant, and often very sympathetic dope doctor who can’t say “No” to the patients who want narcotics constantly prescribed. . . . He reports every case of addiction as one of disease other than addiction. The last class of medical dope-seller or commercial dope-doctor is frankly vicious. He is rarely a narcotic addict himself, and is in the game for the money he can make out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Doctors Under Indictment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dispatches report that thirty-five physicians of Chicago were under indictment at one time for furnishing ‘snow’ and other drugs to victims, and that some of them have grown rich in the business in a very brief time. One of these men had 600 &quot;patients’ visiting him two or three times a week, netting him about $6,000 a week clear profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not only in Chicago that such things have happened. The mere ability to write “M.D.” after one’s name does not carry with it a guaranty of principle. We clip the following from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> covering conditions which prevailed some years back in and about Boston:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Assistant District Attorney Charles W. Blood is engaged in assembling an amazing mass of startling information of orgies and immoralities involving the names of many prominent young physicians and business men of Woburn, Medford, Malden, Everett, and other towns near Boston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Women whose lives have been ruined, and who have been induced with satanic campaigning to indulge in narcotics, have fairly tumbled into the prosecutor’s office to narrate the sordid details of the diabolic manner in which they -were enslaved to the unscrupulous doctors who turned their professional knowledge to corrupt purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enough has already been disclosed to justify the authorities in their charge that a certain group of professional men have been engaged in a nefarious Society of Indulgence that preyed on moral girls and enervated them through drugs so that morality would succumb to immorality. Girls in their teens, others just attaining womanhood, matrons &quot;with unblemished records, have been snared into the iniquitous net on their visits to doctors as patients; have been induced through infatuation for some member of the ring to indulge in their gay parties, and have with carefully planned cunning been led from one surreptitious step to another until they have entirely forsaken the upright teachings of their homes and have entered with full vehemence into the orgiastic sordidness planned for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. T. D. Crothers, professor of mental and nervous diseases in the New York School of Clinical Medicine, in his book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Morphinism,</span><span class="font6"> writing to his brother physicians, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Institutions which claim to be hospitals or sanitariums in many instances depend largely on the secret, or open use of this drug for all forms of diseases under their care. There can be no doubt that in this way much of the morphinism comes from its surreptitious use by dishonest, unprincipled persons. Careful study of morphinism shows that one-fourth of the cases have contracted morphine addiction from curiosity or association. Of the remainder a large percentage are undoubtedly first due to its reckless use by ignorant and unskilled persons, as well as by physicians. This is clearly evidenced from the fact that a large number of physicians, and many others, do not understand the danger from the use of morphine by the needle. As physicians, they are taught to prescribe it for transitory and other pains, with little thought of any possible dangers from its continuous use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No doubt irresponsible and irregular doctors contribute very largely to the spread of this addiction. The custom a few years ago of teaching patients to use the needle and furnishing them with the drug to relieve states of neuralgia and unexpected pain paroxysms was very dangerous. This practice undoubtedly made many morphine victims. Foolish physicians who thought the whole province of medicine was to relieve pain under all circumstances, and who used morphine in a routine way, have made many victims of this class. Many quack medicines for the relief of pain contain morphine; and when this is discovered the purchaser buys the drug direct, and its use is continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one time an effort was made in New York to assist the so-called medical addicts, who acquired the habit innocently because of some painful disease, such as gallstones or cancer. This was done by providing them with certificates so that they could daily procure the drug, in ever decreasing doses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These prescription certificates were provided for their own protection, so that if found with the drug on their person they would not be subject to arrest. But it was found that the effects of the drugs so lowered their moral sensibilities that they used the certificates to protect themselves while they procured the drugs from dope peddlers in much larger quantities than the certificates called for.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>British Responsibility for This Deviltry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We are indebted to a Boston district attorney for the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact seems to be that the British government is responsible for the large quantity of opium flooding the world today. The cultivation of the poppy is fostered by the government: manufactured into opium in the government factory at Ghazipur, and into morphine by British firms in London and Edinburgh; and sent out into the world through trade channels, illegal and otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When manufactured, the opium is disposed of in three ways, as follows: a certain amount is reserved for Indian consumption and handed over to the Excise Department; another portion, styled “medical opium”, is sent to London; and the remainder is sold at monthly sales at Calcutta. Most of this Calcutta-sold opium finds its way to China eventually. The revenue to the government for the year 1905-6 was nearly $22,000,000 net from this “monopoly”, as the blue book referred to calls it. After the opium is thus auctioned, England as a government is no longer concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A study of England’s colonies and dependencies and foreign concessions shows that the opium trade is the source of very great colonial revenue, often reaching the proportion of one-half the entire amount. The Straits Settlements in 1917 had a total revenue of $19,672,104, of which $9,182,000 came from opium traffic.'Hong Kong in 1917 derived one-third of its revenue from opium. India, the source and fount of the opium trade, derives its revenue from many sources; but two of them, opium and excise, concern us. Excise duties arc collected exclusively on spirits, beer, opium and intoxicating drugs. For 1916-1917 the total revenue was 118,799,968 pounds sterling, and the revenue from opium and excise amounted to 12,375,904 pounds sterling. During ten years, ending 1916-1917 the net receipts from excise duties increased 47 percent and opium receipts 44 percent. The revenue from other drugs (excluding opium) increased 67 percent. The total revenue of India for the year 1919-20 was £135,570,000, and of this, the amount from opium and liquor was £15,743,100. In the year 1920-21, the total revenue decreased to £134,825,900, but the revenue from opium and liquor increased to £16,616,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the various opium conferences at Geneva British delegates have always refused to limit the growth of opium to the medicinal needs of the world. They have done this because in India they have 600,000 acres under opium and have a revenue from it running into the millions of pounds. They have, however, agreed to a yearly curtailment of production of 10 percent, effective since 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meantime it is claimed that Chinese homegrown opium has largely increased, especially in the provinces under the control of the so-called “Christian” Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang, though the central government at Nanking has passed an act prohibiting the production and use of opium except for medicinal purposes. Whether the act will be enforced is another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">China’s military overlords have been paying their soldiers and maintaining themselves in power by openly forcing the farmers in their provinces to plant poppy seed. A reason why in some areas food products are scarce is because so many fields have thus been given over to opium growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If reports are to be believed, the year after the opium conferees at Geneva agreed to decrease their acreage 10 percent a year, Turkey increased her acreage from three square miles to three thousand square miles, making her now one of the world’s largest producers of the drug. Turkey does not permit her own people to become drug addicts. Virtually all the Turkish opium is exported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a problem is this! Here is something in which there is a mint of money, an unlimited and rapidly grooving market, and it seems necessary all at once to make and enforce a worldwide agreement to limit production, inasmuch as all that is produced will most certainly be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where Big Business Comes In</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Big Business knows that there is money in illicit drugs. When a group of narcotic smugglers was broken up in Germany in 1926 the German government made the claim to the League of Nations that in their confessions the guilty men had insisted that they Avere backed up by ten American banks and had accomplices on the New York police force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A single concern in central Europe, Roessler Fils, in the one year of 1928 manufactured two and a half times as much heroin as would be required for the legitimate needs of the whole world for that year, and that concern is merely one of several at Basle, Switzerland, and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not likely that Koessler Fils will need any financial assistance, as the profit on this accursed stuff is 700 to 800 percent, but if they did need a loan, and a large one, at their home bank, is there any doubt whatever that they would be accommodated? Money lenders do not concern themselves with anything except the safety of the principal and the certainty of the payment of the interest, One of these big concerns recently tried to ship four tong of heroin to Egypt, through France, but the French government, to their credit, refused to permit the goods to enter their country, even for transshipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one of the opium conferences an Italian, Signor Cavazzoni, brought forward a plan that would have enabled the tracing of each kilo to its ultimate destination, but as soon as it was seen that this would ruin the drug trade it was killed iiistanter by a new set of model rules similar to those already in existence and under which the illicit trade is &quot;doing splendidly”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every country that has drug manufacturing corporations is jealous of every other country that has drug manufacturing corporations. It wants nothing done that will interfere with the growth of its own corporations. Hence the resistance against restrictions that would really restrict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chemists have a new trick, that is, the making of morphine-esters. An ester can be exported and imported freely. A ‘pharmaceutical company^ can take a ton of one of these esters, remove the acid, and at once be in possession of several hundred pounds of morphine which is not accounted for or recorded against it in any way. Japan is the only country that has forbidden the manufacture or importation of these esters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Hqw the United States Gels Its Opium</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago the United States Public Health Service furnished the secretary of state with a statement of the amount of opium desired by the pharmaceutical companies. The secretary of state then sent a statement of this desired amount to England, and England delivered the goods. This is probably still the procedure,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few years ago the United States was thus importing 640,000 pounds of crude opium annually, which amounts to 50 grains for each person in the United States. No other civilized country imports more than three grains per capita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During 1930 'American drug manufacturers may import only 128,000 pounds of opium and 201,000 pounds of coca leaves, which shows some progress in the right direction, but the United States still has a higher per capita consumption of medical drugs than is reported by any other of the big powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The profits of dope smugglers are enormous, very much more than when their goods are obtained through the usual pharmaceutical channels; for Big Business does not readily let go of large profits in any business where large profits are to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A smuggler can buy narcotics in Europe for $3 an ounce and sell them in the United States for $12 an ounce; and by adulterating the drugs, as is often done, these immense profits can be increased from 300 percent to 1,000 percent. But morphine, sold in New York at $12 an ounce, when it reaches the addict is quoted at around a dollar </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> grain, or more than $400 an ounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ingenious methods have been contrived by these agents of Beelzebub for smuggling dope into the country. Revenue agents confiscated two teddy bears, and found them filled with &quot;dope” worth hundreds of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Metal capsules of drugs have been fed to dogs, donkeys and cattle, and they have been driven across the line and slaughtered to obtain the narcotics. Similar capsules have been attached to the legs of pigeons. A San Antonio pigeon fancier had a pigeon he once owned return home to him with a capsule attached to each leg containing $5 or $10 worth of narcotics in each capsule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A supply was found hidden in a bird cage which was taken from off a vessel in Brooklyn. Seamen and others aboard freighters coming from China, Germany, and Italy have been detected bringing in quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some Somali seamen, when they came ashore, had their ordinary sets of false teeth in their pockets, but in their mouths they had magnificent sets, with every one of the thirty-two teeth packed full of cocaine. Girls came ashore carrying a fortune in their earrings and necklaces. Some men who are rumrunners by night are narcotic dealers by day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6"> ton of illicit opium was found in a New York warehouse, as a result of a friendly tip by the truckman who hauled it. At a carpet plant in Connecticut $200,000 worth was found in a bale of wool. The opium, in small canvas sacks arranged on a belt somewhat like a cartridge belt, was found by workmen when they were opening the bale. Somebody must have missed connections at the pier in New York!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font6"> unsuspecting baggage clerk asked an innocent question of a drug smuggler who came in on the He de France and he fled from the pier leaving $300,000 worth of morphine and heroin, the largest seizure ever made at a pier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is much smuggling of dope from China into San Francisco by the Chinese crews of boats engaged in the transpacific trade. Only a few months ago a diplomat’s wife tried to bring in a trunkful from the Orient, but was caught and sent back to China to be tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On twenty-three important seizures of narcotics at San Francisco port last year the official fines were fixed at $608,210, but this amount was reduced to $15,183, which is a considerable reduction, to say the least. The value of drugs unlawfully imported is supposed to be between $50,000,000 and $80,000,000 a year. Officials of the Narcotic Division of the Treasury Department estimated that in 1928 the smuggling operations were triple what they were in 1927.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Uncle Sam’s Bad Showing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Though there has evidently been some improvement in recent years, yet the foregoing facts seem to establish the conclusion that Uncle Sam is properly chargeable with indifference and inertia on this narcotic problem, as claimed by Mrs. H. Wright, delegate to the opium conference in the year 1925. China has awarded Mrs. Wright a medal in recognition of her services to the cause of prohibiting the use of opium except for scientific purposes in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The government policy of the United States has always been to discourage the opium trade in China; yet it permits a vast quantity of morphine and heroin manufactured by our esteemed “pharmaceutical companies” to be shipped to 'Japan, knowing that it will be transshipped to China and sold in the foreign settlements of Shanghai and other Chinese cities in which the sale of opiates is strictly forbidden in the native city, but cannot be prevented in the foreign quarters. All the Chinese addicts have to do is to cross the line into the foreign section to obtain all they wish; for there was enough of the accursed stuff shipped by our “pharmaceutical companies” from Seattle in five months to give a dose to every one of the 400,000.000 men, women and children of China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a consequence the Chinese people are seeing through the whole heathenish, hypocritical performance, and are seriously doubting the dictum of our Supreme Court to the effect that the United States is a Christian nation. Japan itself, heathen nation as we know it to be, while it is a large buyer in Calcutta of crude opium and a large buyer' in America of manufactured </span><span class="font2">opium, FOR THE CHINESE WHOM IT IS IN PROCESS </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">of subjugating, has no opium shops of its own and protects its people from the dangers of opium by strict laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Information obtained from the files of the murdered gambler Arnold Rothstein were sufficient to convince United States Attorney J. M. Blake that the three American drug rings involve important persons in public life, including attorneys, politicians and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By a bill rushed through the Congress ‘without a record vote or any discussion’ officials in charge of the Virgin Islands (part of United States possessions near Porto Rico) were expressly relieved from the duty of reporting on shipments of drugs either in or out, thus leaving the door wide open for smuggling. This bill was listed as Virgin Islands legislation and not under the subject of narcotics, and for that reason attracted no attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In New York city when eight agents had surrounded a sale which they knew was to take place, involving about $500 worth of illegal narcotics, the principal seller was allowed to make his escape through the ring and only a small abettor of the sale was arrested. Eleven mem- -bers of the narcotic squad of the New York police, in the fall of 1928, were charged with illegally having narcotics in their possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States is about to have two narcotic farms, each of 1,000 acres, and equipped to care for 1,000 inmates where drug addicts will receive special treatment. Arrangements have also been made with twelve other governments for the direct exchange of information respecting illicit trade in narcotics and the enforcement of narcotic legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Demons Back of the Dope</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reading the foregoing evidence of the slippage of the human family downward into the gulf of drug addiction, one is struck by the . fact that an influence more potent than human ingenuity is at work in the earth. For instance, what motive could prompt a &quot;drugbooster”, described above, who is not an addict himself, to persuade others to use the deadly stuff? Is the power for evil in the human heart greater than the power for good?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we consider that six thousand years of-degeneracy, since man first fell into sin and began to lose the glorious image of God in which he was originally created, have been insufficient to eradicate the last vestige of uprightness, we are inclined to believe in the poAver of good. In every human soul we can trace some spark of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rough exteriors and calloused consciences and countenances make this less discernible in some; but here and there, when some tender chord is struck, we catch a glimpse of the better self that has now become too weak to struggle for the mastery. So we look outside the pale of humanity to discover, if possible, the source of such diabolical work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the beginning of the world, Satan, the prince of devils, has craved complete possession of the human race. To this end he has sought to destroy the mental and moral image of God that was the original gift to mankind. By any means through which reason is dethroned, the will weakened, and the impulses and emotions stirred to their depths, he seeks his prey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And as if to reach the zenith of his power in demoniacal inoculation, the prince of devils has engineered a course for the debauching of the human race that only his genius could contrive. By no better means could he more quickly and more effectually destroy the will power that stands between moral uprightness and degeneracy. In this rapid increase in the use of drugs we see his hand; and from his own realm of demons, through the channel of a medium, we have the confession. In the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World, </span><span class="font6">Mrs. Lambert, spiritist, is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foui’ great divas [princes of the demons] are now in control of the situation, and are closest to the earth plane. The divas are responsible for the awakening of the general desire for too much liberty, in fact they are raising hob with almost everything and everybody, and unless some of the “masters” stop it there will be worse disaster. It is this ‘ ‘ control ’ ’ that is behind Bolshevism, and it is also causing a greater tendency to drug addiction, particularly among women. The divas understand they are playing havoc on this “plane” but they are working for future generations, for some reason, and ultimately they will teach these generations that there is a sort of soul intoxication with a stronger kick in it than the best that ever passed over what was once known as a bar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">T N A New Jersey town a man was arrested for inciting an assault on the police. To his defense he brought seven witnesses into court, all atheists. The law said the atheists might not testify. Seems like a. poor law, for in the court of Moses himself God made provision that the testimony of a stranger was to be received as well as that of an Israelite. The man was found ‘guilty’ because his seven witnesses could not testify. Here is a case where law triumphed over justice and over common sense.</span></p>

This is possible because electric current is produced at less than 3/4c a kilowatt hour and sold to private consumers at fifteen to twenty times what it costs to produce. The ultimate consumer will pay the millions in profits grabbed off by the above deal. The issuance of the bonds was evidently pure hocus-pocus to cover up the extraordinary and extortionate profits the concern has been making.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Thrilling Story of the Late War, Told in the Language of the Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Copyright, 1930, by Daniel E. Morgan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">ITH the war ended, the very atmosphere seemed changed. Bonfires burned, and we began to get thawed out. The rolling kitchens, or galleys, came up; we had some chow. The boys began building rainproof shelters or tents. There were no bursting shells now. What a strange world we seemed to be in!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there was within us the awful fear that perchance the shots and shells would fly again. One cannot take hunted animals out of their holes and tell them that they are free and let it go at that. The horrors and hardships of war had fastened upon us the never-ending desire to dig in. The well-learned lessons of what had to be done to keep one’s life within its shell could not be forgotten in a day. How very easy it is to live outside, winter or summer, when there is no one shooting at you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That first day of peace I worked all day fixing up a bunk with rags, jags and old pieces of bags, looking forward to one good night’s sleep, as we would be moving in the morning. My hopes were all in vain. Our captain ordered me to pack up and proceed right away to the next town and hunt up billets for the company. I was sergeant of the third or last platoon, and when the orders came I protested. With all the haughtiness of peacetime lordship, the two captains of our company, with dirty, sheepish look, bawled me out. I was given to understand that I was a marine, and an enlisted man, and that means to obey, right or wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At all times I was on the very best of terms with the corporals and privates, but not so with the captains. There seemed to be on their part a hatred of me, and I did not like those birds either. I am happy to think of some good officers among us during war days; but a pickle in the jelly spoils the whole mess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Captain De Rhody, a prince in war and peace, was with us from the time we broke camp in America until the first battle. Wounded, he came to me in the battle of Chateau-Thierry, saying, “Sergeant Morgan, I am shot through the foot.” I looked and blood wms streaming from his shoe. The battle was on and he must evacuate. “Morgan, take charge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Zoltowski’s Censorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lieutenant Zoltowski, promoted from the ranks, was a fine chap. We were in training together. After he was promoted to be an officer, it was his duty to censor my mail. Now if there is anything in this world that a young man dislikes it is to have somebody read his love letters before he sends them to his girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we were on a common level, both sergeants. He was promoted to be an officer. The military law, as I saw it meted out aboard ship, was ten days in your room for being familiar with the non-commissioned personnel. Any courtesies or kindnesses he might show me would be at his own risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I had written a letter to my girl in blue, such as one would write who expected to marry the girl, if he ever got back. I handed it to my pal, Lieutenant Zoltowski. He took it and very carefully opened the letter, which I had not sealed, and instead of reading it, turned quickly to the end, signed it, and handed it back to me marked “0 K”, without having read a word of it, the act of a real man among men. He knew that there would be nothing in my letter that would betray anybody or anything. His manly action proved it. With a tear in my eye I tell you that Lieutenant Zoltowski was killed in the next battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, as before stated, the gaffers who were in charge of our outfit at the close of the war were not any too sweet on me, and, as ordered, I loaded by pack upon my back and started for the next town. Arriving there I found every house, barn and coal shanty (if such there was) filled with leathernecks from other companies. After scouting around the half-wrecked town, the only place I could find was a cathedral with the roof shot off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I waited at one of the corners of the wrecked building and after what seemed like an age the company came into view. There they were, the two captains like tin gods riding at the head of the column. Leaders? Skunks, I think. Our greeting was not pleasant. It looked as if our captain might jump down my throat as I told him about the billets. Anyway, we all unloaded in the wrecked cathedral.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>New Guns! Bah!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We stayed in Letanne, near Beaumont, from November 14 to 17. After carrying the heavy French Hotchkiss machine guns all through the war, we now received the Brownings, with all new equipment, and must begin all over again to learn to operate and repair them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You can bet that the boys grumbled; and who had the heart to go on drilling and learning war, now that it had ended? As a sergeant it was my duty to learn and then teach the use of the new’ guns to the crews. I had made up my mind I was not going to learn any more about weapons of war if they hung me. I spoke freely with the crews on these subjects, which was a very grave breach of military discipline. But -what did I care? The war was over and we ■wanted to go home. The gang agreed with me, as they did in all other things. They were the country’s finest men, good soldiers, but now it was home that they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the morning of the 17th of November we all lined up for the march across Belgium into Germany. I had never felt so sick as on that morning. My head was bursting, my nerves were shattered, and I really felt like lying down to die along the roadside. I should have been on the sick list, and sent back to a hospital; but no, I would see the thing through. We hiked about fifteen miles that day to Margut, and billeted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As soon as we stopped, orders came to put out a patrol, and the hardest thing I ever did in my life was to detail some of the men that had been marching all day to stand guard at night. It seemed as if the military machine that was grinding out the lives of innocent men and boys would never stop grinding. Out -went the guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next day, beginning at 8:15 a. m., we started to hike again and at 4.30 reached Bellefontaine. The distance covered was approximately twenty kilometers. On this march we gleaned some truth relative to the strength of the German army. They had piled along the way ammunition dumps with thousands of shells of every caliber. There were cannons galore. On the border of Belgium there were fields full of artillery. The war did not stop because of lack of military strength. It did not seem as if there was enough man power left in the world to drive the Germans back to Germany. However, the war had ended, and that we knew, if nothing else. When should we go home ?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Hard on Fritz’s Heels</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">As we arrived in Bellefontaine the German rear guard was leaving. After a night’s rest we awoke to see houses here and there marked with a big black cross. As soon as the Belgians and French were liberated they went through the town, marking the homes of those who had been familiar with the German officers and men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being human, the girls, some of them, had picked out their men and carried on a courtship. Their own kind of men had all been dragged off by the war . machine, and many of them were now pushing up daisies. You could hardly blame these girls. This war was not their war, in spite of the fact that school boys and girls are taught to live and die for flag and country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The call of romance, dormant in every girl, with the inbred desire to hear someone say, “What pretty eyes, and hands I love to hold!” had brought about the same old situation, the same old and beautiful story of love, the tale that never grows old. Did not our boys, later, make love to the German girls ? and did not the higher command worry about it? It takes a mighty strong command to order one not to fall in love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We marched across a corner of Belgium into Germany. As we crossed the border the blinds of all the houses were drawn, but here and there some could be seen peeping out through the curtains. It was a sad occasion, be it victory or defeat. On we marched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the distance marched was between fifteen and thirty kilometers (ten to twenty miles) a day, yet it all seemed to us like unnecessary forced marches. The mules pulled the gun carts, and we dragged along, hanging to them. Tired and sick in body and soul we piled our packs upon the carts. Military style said it should not be so. The captain rode back on his horse and ordered us human pack horses to load up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Real Bed and a Beer Garden</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On November 20 we resumed our march, leaving Bellefontaine at 7:30 a. m. We hiked through St. Maric, Etalle, Sinry, Stockem and Freylang. Our company marched on to Viville, about three miles west of Arion, and billeted. At these billets some of us slept with, the cattle, which was the warmest place, while others hit the hay. The officers were billeted in the farm houses, in beds, if there were any to be had. Two of the boys happened to get a bed to sleep in one night, and that was the talk of the camp. Sleeping in a real bed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While in Belgium, and in the next town to where we were billeted, they had some kind of celebration for the American troops. I did not go: I was too sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes night would overtake us and the town would be too small to hold us all. That was nothing. We lined up in a field, built a bonfire, stuck our feet toward the fire, and went to sleep. In the morning the ground was white with frost. It is good to lie down and rest with no one shooting at you. In the morning we packed up our wet blankets, frost and all, and away we went to the next stopping point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one place where we stopped, after setting the watch, we all went down to the beer garden, and what a merry time we had 1 It was like the Klondike gold rush. At the cafe there were not nearly enough bartenders, and over the bar went some of the boys, rolled up their sleeves, and helped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Making merry and singing songs, it was not long before I was spending the francs and marks that I had taken, for souvenirs, from the bodies of the dead. One could smell the scent of decomposed bodies on the money. I sighed for the dead, but here goes, “Give us another drink.” With all this fire water under our belts, sleeping out on frosty nights seemed like lying under a shady tree.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>In the Duchy of Luxemburg</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We were now in the Duchy of Luxemburg. Our company was held in reserve, while the other companies had to take up machine gun positions. It looked like a lot of bunk to us. The war was over. When should we go home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Schroderof, where we were to stay over Thanksgiving, the chow wagon was with us, but the fare was not any too good. We still had to exist on -war rations. Someone discovered that one of the farmers had a lot of lump sugar. We all craved some kind of sweets. I got two pockets full of this lump sugar for about fifty cents. What a treat!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After we fell out of formation for the day, some of us hiked across the fields hunting for food. When we came to a farm the occupants were afraid of us. What a time we had trying to explain our mission! Most of us could talk French by now, but here we were in another strange land. Some of the boys who could speak German taught us to say, “Haben Sie Brot?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Haben Sie Milch!” (Have you bread! Have you milk?) So, armed with these phrases, we hunted farms. I believe I got one jelly sandwich out of one of these trips. They did not know what to charge us, so we generally paid them a mark or a franc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was but a matter of hours until the German women were cooking big meals for us, while we lounged in their parlors. There was absolutely no hatred between us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As I remember it, the galley force had bought some pigs. I believe we all chipped in to pay for them. These w<sup>T</sup>ere to be roasted for Thanksgiving Day.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Not Insubordination—Just Disgust</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">While in camp here, of course, we had to drill a bit with the new guns. There might be another war, you know. My turn came to take the boys out to drill. “Fall in, company. Attention, squads right, march!” And away we went, out behind the barn. When far enough away from the captain’s quarters I shouted, “Squads wrong, go ahead.” Of course the boys knew that that meant to fall out. “Now you boys can play with those guns if you wish to, but I am through.” They sat around the guns, making believe, and we all enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My enlistment had expired and I made a request to be sent back to the IL S. A. to be discharged. I was called to the captain’s office and he told me that if I decided to apply for transfer to the States he would not give me my gunnery sergeant’s warrant. While I was a sergeant, and had my credentials, yet I had filled a place of higher rank all through the war, and still held the position of a gunnery sergeant. “Well, sir, you can keep your warrant if I get my transfer,” and he was small enough to hold rne to the bargain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the night before Thanksgiving. At about 9: 00 p. m. I had gone to the barn, where I slept. I was again called to the office and told that I was to leave in the morning for the United States. The shock nearly put me under. I sat up all night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were five others to go along. It seems that some very young marines had not obeyed the orders to hold at all costs, and deserted in the face of the enemy. These had been court-martialed, and were to he sent to the States to serve time in prison. Someone had to take them back. Four marines from our battalion, whose time had expired, were 'detailed to take them back, and I was one of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Parting with the Real Heroes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thanksgiving morning was one morning when all the boys could sleep in. We were to leave early; so there was no time to say goodbye. It may be said by the commanding officer that I was not a good sergeant, but every last man of the enlisted personnel crawled out of the hay at 7:00 a. m., when they could have stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first sergeant called me aside, and said, “Morgan, here are two letters, one to my mother and one to my girl. Do not let them get out of your hand until you land in the U. S. A., and then please mail them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A third letter was for me. Months later, when I opened it in the States, I found the finest tribute ever paid one war rat to another. Sergeant McNulty was wounded, yet fought by my side, when there were no officers to be had. He stuck it through. Now we were to part. His note read, “Good-bye, Sergeant D. E. Morgan—a good soldier,” and that was all. It brought tears to my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the other boys handed me their uncensored letters to mail. “Take these over the pond, Danny.” They trusted me to deliver their uncensored mail into a mail box somewhere in the U. S. A. I would not fail them for all of the censor laws ever written. What did I care about military laws now? The war was over. Their faith in me as a trusted comrade was all the orders I needed. I would have delivered them if 1 had hung for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We passed through many a battle without a tear, but now the war was over and we were to separate. My eyes and theirs were wet with tears. I would have left without saying goodbye to the captain. I had my traveling orders, and need ask no permission to leave. However, the- captain sent for me and wished me bon voyage and a fond good-bye. The past faded away as we stood there and shook hands. He was subject, as are all other military men, to a cruel arrangement of military discipline—dog eat dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we started down' the road the boys let out a yell and cheered us until we were out of sight. My heart and soul were filled with joy and sadness. I wiped the tears from my face. We, the rats of a terrible nightmare called “war”, had suffered tortures together, and now we had parted, most of us never to meet again.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark105"></a>A Question and Answer</span></h3>
<div><img src="g_E_19300820_files/g_E_19300820-18.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">VESTION:</span><span class="font6"> Will you please explain what is called “The Lord’s prayer”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font6"> Jesus was explaining to. His disciples the difference between a proper prayer and an improper one. The improper prayer is the one offered by a hypocrite. Jesus explained that it was hypocrites that loved to pray standing in the synagogues (that is, before congregations of men) and standing on the street corners (that is, in public). It was the hypocrites that made </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font6"> prayers, with vain repetitions (that is, they repeated their requests over and over again).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After calling attention to these wrong methods of prayer, and condemning them, Jesus told His followers that wdren they wished to offer an acceptable prayer they should go alone into their closets and pray in secret to God, who would hear in secret. Here we have a severe rebuke to those people who in our day love to stand up before large audiences or stand before the microphone and in sanctimonious tones utter long prayers full of repetitions, in order that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">men may hear</span><span class="font6"> their hypocritical and sanctimonious voices. There are no Scriptures in support of the popular idea of public prayers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After condemning and pointing out the hypocritical methods of prayer, and in terse language telling His followers that prayer is a sacred privilege of coming into the presence of God, with no other human ear to hear your petitions or expressions of thanksgiving and gratitude, then Jesus uttered a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sample</span><span class="font6"> prayer for the benefit, not only of His disciples, but of His faithful and obedient followers ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a sample in that it was very short; it was also a sample in that it covers all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">main </span><span class="font6">points involved in approach to God by any of His children. It was a sample in that it says not a word about praying for the success of missionary efforts; nor for the success of the prohibition cause; nor for a blessing on the Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Catholic or any other church. Jesus did not suggest that His followers pray for the president, for the governors of the states, nor for any earthly government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is not a word of repetition in it, nor a single word about having the people open up their purse strings and donate a penny for the church. Indeed there is hardly a single prayer uttered today that is in harmony with these words of Jesus, but almost every one of them is in violent antagonism to our Lord's sample prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today clergymen pray for the success of an army in battle (their particular one, always). Some pray for the success of their particular prize fighter; their particular political party; their particular church; their particular football team, and a thousand and one other things, and across the street are other clergymen praying for other prize fighters, and football teams; other armies; other political parties. If all these pra.yers could be compared with the sample which Jesus gave us, they would easily be seen to be selfish, narrow, and full of prejudice. Now let us read Jesus’ sample carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It begins with a proper, reverential recognition of the fact that God is out Father. But wo ask, Whose Father? The answer is, “As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” Of course God is not the Father to the children of the Devil; and speaking to the hypocrites of His day, those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">said</span><span class="font6"> that God was their Father, Jesus said, “Ye are of your father the devil.” (John 8: 44) Surely those who are offering improper prayers and in improper ways are not God’s children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said: “When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thy</span><span class="font6"> name [not the name of some pope, bishop, monk, or some “saint” this or that]. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven so in earth.” How few people </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">believe</span><span class="font6"> that God’s kingdom will come and will cause God’s will to be done on earth as it is done in heaven!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Jesus proceeds: “Give us this day our daily bread”; which is a simple request for daily needs of all kinds. (How simple and childlike such a request!) ‘Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.’ In Mark 11: 26, Jesus says, Tf ye do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.’ Thus we can see that any man who asks God to forgive him, and holds malice, or hatred against his fellow men, is not offering an acceptable prayer, and his prayer will not be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the prayer proceeds: “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” We ask, Does God lead anyone into temptation? And of course the answer is No. In James 1:13 we read that God tempteth no man. In examining the translation, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font6"> find that a correct translation reads: “Abandon us not [leave us not] in temptation.” How sensible this is! and how absurd is the other thought!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The final words of this prayer are: “For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever. Amen.” These last words are spurious, and not found in any modern version. Neither are thej^ found in the original Greek text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the sample prayer first addresses God as our Father, and the only one whose name is to be hallowed or reverenced. The second thought is of His coming kingdom and its blessing of mankind; the third one, for our personal needs; the next one, for the forgiveness of our trespasses; and then for help in time of trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such is the sample or model prayer. How simple it is! how devoid of ostentation, of sanctimony and affectation! There is no effort to tell God wdiat He must<sup>-</sup> do or must not do. He is not </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">commanded</span><span class="font6"> to bless our efforts to convert the heathen; neither is God commanded to send down fire from heaven on His enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one occasion a lady, on her knees, was heard praying to God that He would spare the life of anothex- lady who was dying. Shaking her clenched fist toward heaven, she said, “God, you must, you </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font6"> spare this girl’s life.” Such a prayer was presumptuous and blasphemous, and did not have the divine approval. It was not at all in harmony with the model prayer. It lacked the confident faith, the quiet dignity, the reverential manner, necessary and required in a child approaching a loving, just and considerate father. Let us all hereafter follow the instructions of Jesus, and go into our closet alone when we approach our heavenly Father, and then reverently make known our petitions in a respectful and reverential way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Judgment of the Nations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">An address by Judge Rutherford broadcast June 22 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH caused His judgment against the nations to be written in His Word. Knowing the end from the beginning and the course that the nations would take He caused record of the judgment to be made long in advance. Now His time has come to execute His judgment against those nations. In this day the facts coming to pass in fulfilment of God’s prophecy enable the student of His Word to ascertain the time of judgment and when it begins upon the nations and what will be the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Revelation 11:17,18 it is written: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, . . . because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” From the facts well known to all the prophecy thus expressed began to have its fulfilment in 1914, when the nations of Christendom became angry and began fighting each other. The wrath of God followed shortly thereafter. There is much evidence proving that the judgment of God upon the nations will reach a climax within a very few years. It is of importance that all thinking persons should now’ calmly consider the evidence showing that His judgments are about to fall upon the nations in severity, and for that reason I shall attempt to call your attention to some of the proof. To do this it is necessary to relate some facts that came to pass long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God organized'the Israelites into a nation and called them His people. He appointed certain men and specifically directed them to instruct the people concerning God and Uis law. What is commonly called “religion” occupied a prominent part in the Hebrew<sup>7</sup> life. Scribes, priests and Pharisees ministered to the people as it’ was their duty in things pertaining to God’s Word. They formed w<sup>7</sup>hat is properly called the clergy class and wdiich class corresponds with the clergy of Christendom of the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those men generally were unfaithful to God and to their commission and they misled the people and thereby brought great responsibility upon themselves and upon the nation of Israel. When Jesus came to earth He emphasized this fact. In the twenty-third chapter of Matthew<sup>7</sup> the words of God’s judgment against those unfaithful men in particular, and those of the nation supporting them in general, were pronounced by Jesus, and amongst other things He said: “That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often wmuld I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye wmuld not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within a few years after the pronouncement of that judgment the city of Jerusalem was completely destroyed, most of the people killed, and the survivors scattered throughout the earth, and the Jews have never been a nation since. The Jewish nation, while it existed as such, wms a typical nation. That people was God’s covenant people and foreshadow<sup>7</sup>ed those W<sup>T</sup>ho in modern times w<sup>7</sup>ould claim to be God’s covenant people, and this particularly has reference to so-called “Christendom”. What came upon the Jewish nation foreshadowed the execution of God’s judgment upon the nations of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the radio audience have by letter asked such questions as these: “What constitutes a Christian nation? Is it not the duty of the Christians to clean up the earth and make it a fit place in which the people may live in peace ? Is it not therefore the solemn duty of the Chri s-tians to be for every law<sup>7</sup> that tends to accomplish this end?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptural answer is that the United States, the British Empire, Germany, Italy and other like nations claim to be Christian, but they are not. Evidently these nations make such claim because the people thereof </span><span class="font5">are sup</span><span class="font6">posed to have adopted the Christian religion, as distinguished from Confucianism or Buddhism. In all of these nations of so-called “Christendom” there are three primary elements that go to make up the ruling or governing class, to wit, the commercial, the political and the rcli-gious part. The religious leaders or preachers of all the denominations, both Catholic and Protestant, may be properly classed together as the clergy. All will agree that the clergy claim these nations are “Christian” nations and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">therefore are collectively called “Christendom”. The clergy claim that it is their God-given duty and privilege to have a part in the political affairs of the government of these nations at least to the point of giving instruction as to who shall be elected to office and how the affairs of the nations shall be directed. They take the commercial and political leaders into their organizations and make them to understand that they must all -work together in governmental affairs and in church affairs, and they have induced the commercial and political parts of the nations to believe that the nation is Christian. In this they are wrong. There is no such a thing as a “Christian” nation on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Christ” means the One Anointed by Jehovah God, the One that is officially appointed to act for and in the name of God to carry out His purposes. When Jesus was on earth He was anointed by Jehovah to be the King and Head of God’s kingdom, and He declared in plain phrase that His kingdom is not of this Avorld but that it would be set up only at His second coming, at the end of this world. Therefore not one of these nations of this world called “Christendom” is in any wise a Christian nation. The name Christendom is improperly applied to the nations of the earth. Many people have been misled thereby. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact, however, that these nations claim to be Christian, and claim to rule by virtue of the power and authority granted to them from Jehovah God, and the fact that the clergy hold themselves out as the representatives of God, and yet as a part of the nations, places these nations in a position of special responsibility and subjects them to the judgment of God. His judgment, therefore, is written concerning </span><span class="font5">them. </span><span class="font6">Last Sunday it was observed from the Scriptures that judgment began in 1918, first upon God’s consecrated people, called the house of the Lord, and that judgment thereafter must come upon those who collectively claim to represent God, and such are the nations of earth that claim to be Christian. The prophecies were written long ago and intended to apply and do apply in these days and are due to be understood at the end of the world, where we now are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among those prophecies is that of Habakkuk 2:20, wherein it is written: “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” It is the expressed will of God that notice shall be served upon the nations now of the judgment thereof, in order that men of these nations might know of God’s purpose before it comes to pass. It is easy to see that the word “earth” in the text just quoted is used symbolically. It means the organized governments that rule the peoples on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three elements just mentioned administer and rule in all the nations of “Christendom”. It is true that the people are supposed to have a voice in the affairs of government. The people do cast their votes for the election of men to office, but 'when it comes to the administration of the affairs of government tire people have little or nothing to say concerning that. The commercial is the real dominant power that rules. It has become a proverb well spoken, that “Money talks”. The men who control the money see to it that their money compels other men to do the talking for them. I am not a communist, nor an alarmist, nor am I speaking for political influence. I must tell the truth, and my purpose is to relate the facts, that the people may see what judgment is shortly to come upon the nations and that they may have the opportunity to take the course accordingly. After having related these facts, then I shall quote to you from the Scriptures the judgment already written therein, and this for your information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Avritten in 1 Timothy 6:10 that the love of money is the root of all evil. Evil is that which brings hurt or injury to others. Men who do acquire great wealth are usually men of more than ordinary intelligence. Their love for money and for poAver has led these men to form combinations, otherwise called corporations, by which they control the commerce of the nations. Although there are approximately 120 million people in the United States, a little company of less than 300 men control the great corporations and the money power of the nation, and each one of these men has an annual income of more than a million dollars. At the same time there are approximately four million men and 'women in the country who must earn their bread by labor and who are unable to find employment. There are millions of others who must deny themselves the comforts and even the necessities of life because of injustice practiced by the few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These organized corporate powers are used as instruments of oppression. Probably the men of great wealth do not stop to consider how many people are suffering, and the cause. Their love for money has blinded them to everything except their own gain of power and influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To them human creatures and human lives are of the smallest importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The small merchant who once served his neighbors and fed his own family by his energy and economy has practically disappeared, because of being thrust out by the greedy corporations. The small banks have been swallowed up by the larger ones and these gigantic corporations control the most acute and brilliant minds to manage financial affairs. If a man brings forth some important invention by which the public might be benefited the great corporations defraud him out of it and use it to exploit the people or else destroy it altogether. The young man wflio might desire to engage in an independent business for himself dares not do so because he could not stem the tide of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The farmer grows his crops at the cost of much labor and money, but the price of his product is fixed by the combined power of a few men. He is compelled to market his goods at what he can get, and the farmer has been reduced to an ordinary tenant or a man of less importance. The farms are almost all mortgaged; and while the farmer is nominally the owner, he is practically a serf of the corporations that hold the mortgage over his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The major part of the legal talent is dominated and controlled by the corporate power, and this is employed for selfish interests and against the interests of the common people. This is also true with reference to the courts, and hence when a poor man goes into court with the hope of finding redress for his just grievance he has little or no chance of relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law-making and law enforcement parts of the government are composed of what is generally known as the political class or element. Dishonesty of all kinds is used to put men into these offices, as is well known. This is done that their power may be used for selfish interests. Frequently these corrupt practices become so flagrant and such an insult to common decency that the great legislative body known as the Congress of the United States begins an investigation. In every instance it appears that the money of the great corporate power is used to corrupt the officeholder in order to accomplish its selfish ends. High public officials are corrupted with money, and this has become so common that the people are wondering if there are any honest statesmen left amongst those who rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men seem to have lost their courage to take a bold stand against the entrenched corporate power. And why is this so ? They well know that if they do take a bold stand for righteousness against the powers of greed the commercial power will see to it that they do not last long. The money porver is really the giant of the ‘nation’ called “Christians”. The politician not only is the ally of the commercial power, but is largely the tool or instrument used by Big Business to accomplish its purposes. If public service corporations desire to increase their cash the political power passes the necessary laws and the courts make the necessary orders to increase the charge for public service, and the people bear the burden and suffer, and there is no redress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not the commercial and political parts of the nation know that they are doing wrong? They should know it, and would doubtless have been awakened to their wrong had their conscience not been seared as with a red-hot iron. What has accomplished the terrible act of searing their conscience thus? In the final analysis the answer would be that it is Satan who has practiced this fraud in using these twrn branches of the nations of the earth to oppress the common people. However, Satan has done so by using a subtle and hypocritical instrument. That instrument so used by Satan he has caused to speak lies in hypocrisy and these lies have misled the commercial and political rulers and likewise kept the people blind to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The audience must agree with me, because it is true, that both the Catholic and Protestant clergy unhesitatingly claim that the nations in vfliich they operate are Christian nations. These men claim to be the representatives of God on earth. They claim to speak with authority. They could not be blind to the fact that the money poAver rules the nations by the formation and operation of great corporations and by debauching public officials. They cannot plead ignorance of the fact that large sums of money are collected and used to influence the selection and election of men to public office. Not only does the public press publish such facts, but some of the most prominent clergymen, themselves heads of their strong organizations, collect the money and use it and distribute it for the very purpose of influencing the selection of men to public office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy see the cruel and oppressive burdens laid upon the backs of the common people by those who are lovers of greed. They know that as a result thereof millions of men and women are suffering for want of food and raiment. They know that public officials walk with their hands behind them and solicit and accept bribes and in this they become so brazen that it comes to the knowledge of the general public. They must know of the many brutal crimes that are committed and that many of such are induced by tainted and ill-got gains of the lovers of gold. They cannot be blind or ignorant of the fact that such public men as Mussolini, like a bold jackass,, constantly keeps himself before the public there to fan the flame of war and bring upon the people more suffering and unrighteous bloodshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regardless of all these wicked things the clergy of America, Britain, Germany, Italy and like countries boldly claim that these nations are Christian nations. These men of the cloth claim to speak with authority from God and they have unhesitatingly said and still say that the commercial and political elements of the governments are ruling by divine right. They have misled the commercial and political men of the world by inducing them to believe that their power is exercised by divine right, and this they have done, as stated in the Scriptures, by the practice of lies and hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The laws of the land recognize that he who aids or encourages or comforts one in the commission of crime is equally guilty of the crime that is committed. The commercial and political parts of the nations not only have been aided and encouraged and comforted in their course of wrongdoing by the clergymen, but have been told that God is using them, together with the clergymen, to rule the world and to make laws and prepare the world so that Christ can come and visit them. Their great radio clergymen publicly herald this message throughout the land. The clergymen have misrepresented God and have misled the rulers of the governments and are therefore more reprehensible before God, and their judgment shall be the more severe, as the Scriptures state. They have made themselves parts of the nations, and because these nations have claimed and still claim to be Christian, God, foreknowing this, is now bringing His judgment upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment Written</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From every part of the earth there come today the cries of the poor and the oppressed. These have been robbed of the fruits of their labors. The clergy not only have stood by and seen the people defrauded, but have encouraged the wrongdoing and made themselves a part of the ones described in the Scriptures as the &quot;rich” and the “oppressors”. God’s judgment against such is written in James 5:1-6: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, 'which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God made an everlasting covenant with man and caused it to be written in His Word long ago. That covenant makes human life a sacred thing and the unrighteous shedding of human blood a colossal crime. The commercial powers of so-called &quot;Christendom” wanted a World War, and they got it. They induced the political elements of the nations to enact the conscription laws compelling innocent men and women to take the field and kill each other. The clergy not only approved and sanctified that war, but fraudulently told the young men that their death upon the battlefield would mean their immediate transportation to heavenly realms. Clothing themselves in skirts of hypocritical service the clergy in the name of God and of Christ pronounced their benediction upon the men who would immediately march into the trenches to shed innocent blood. God’s judgment upon those having part therein is written in Jeremiah 2: 34: &quot;Also in thy'skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If there be honest men left amongst the commercial and political wings of the governments of Christendom, why not now openly forsake an'd repudiate the hypocritical clergy that have misrepresented God and led you into the way of unrighteousness? Concerning those who persist in carrying on or supporting a system that defames the name of Almighty God and His Christ and oppresses the people these words of judgment are written, in the prophecy of Jeremiah 51:57: “I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King whose name is the Lord of hosts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who rule in the nations called “Christendom” must know that they have violated the everlasting covenant by forcing men into the trenches and by employing the shotgun method of enforcing wrongful laws. The ruling powers of these nations are the ones that, in the Scriptures, are called “the earth”; and concerning such the judgment of God is written: “The earth mourneth, and fadeth away, the world languish-eth, and fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”—Isa. 24:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy have misled many honest people of good will by inducing them to believe that organizations such as the Anti-Saloon League and the League of Nations are God-provided instruments to clean up the world and to make it a fit place for Christ to come and conduct His government. By these misrepresentations they have been able to hold the people to the support of their evil institutions. In this they have done a great wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should the people longer be misled by these false prophets? 'Why not hear the Word of God and obey it? God has already set His King upon His throne. Already Christ Jesus has cast Satan out of heaven. Even now Satan is confining his operations to the earth and is hurrying his forces into position preparatory for the great battle of Armageddon. There he arrogantly assumes that he will defeat Christ and then will turn all mankind away from God and into a saturnalia of crime and wickedness. Majestically and orderly the Lord moves His forces into position for that fight. He bids the nations be silent and hear His words of warning and judgment, and this is what He says by His prophet Zephaniah (3:8): “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Already the nations are assembled. Even now the judgment of Jehovah God has begun upon them. A cup and its contents is a symbol of the potion which God has provided that the nations of “Christendom” shall drink. It is an expression of His righteous indignation. These nations have called themselves by the name of the Lord, and out of their own mouths they shall be judged. By His prophet Jeremiah (25:27-36) He thus speaks to them: “Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will se..d among you. And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ye shall certainly drink. For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city [Christendom] which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his holy habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry: and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dis-, pensions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nations are rapidly approaching ths great climax. Christ Jesus, the Mighty Prince and Executive Officer of Jehovah, is in command of the forces of righteousness. Majestically He is advancing to the war and complete victory. His execution of God's judgment upon the nations will clear the world of all unrighteous rule. “Then,&quot; says Jehovah, in the language of the prophet, “will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.”— Zeph. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He will then turn His attention to the common multitudes of the oppressed and suffering peoples upon the earth, and His judgment upon them and in their behalf shall follow. Let the people gain a knowledge of the Lord’s methods of judgment concerning them and they will be glad. Be of good courage. The clouds hang darkly over the world now, but this will soon vanish and the Sun of righteousness with healing light will be manifest and the blessings of the people will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A personal request is now made of each one of this radio audience. For more than a year the watchtower chain program has been sent you each Sunday morning. The purpose has been and is to aid the people to understand the Word of God, There has been no effort or desire to induce anyone to join anything or contribute money. The annual cost of sending out this program is approximately $200,000, the major portion of which is paid for wire charges connecting the.stations. Believing that the radio should be used particularly to instruct the people in the Word of God those who have paid these bills have been glad to do so and thankful to the Lord that it could be done. Now the question arises, Shall an effort be made to continue these chain programs each Sunday morning or shall our efforts be used in some other manner to make known the message of God’s kingdom? You can aid us in determining that question. Do not understand this to be a solicitation for money. The key station desires to ask you this question: Do you desire the watchtower programs to be sent to you each Sunday morning? Kindly send a post card or letter stating whether or not it is your desire to have the programs to continue each Sunday morning. If you do not want them, please so state. If you believe they are beneficial to the public and you want them continued, kindly so state. If your responses show<sup>7</sup> such an interest as would warrant the effort and expense to send the programs they will be continued each Sunday morn® ing as long as the Lord wills and provides.</span></p>

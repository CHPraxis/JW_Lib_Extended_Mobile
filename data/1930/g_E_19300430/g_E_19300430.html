<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font8"> DO not feel that it is proper for me to keep silent in this discussion of the Abrams system of diagnosing and treating disease. There are two principal reasons for this: first, my interest in truth in the abstract, and, second, my interest in that higher phase of truth we very properly refer to under the caption of “present truth”. I have been interested in the latter for many years; in fact, was born and brought up in sympathy ■with it, and without it life would be colorless indeed. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before describing what E.R.A. is, and my connection with it, I wish to quote a few words from the pen of Thomas Colson, D.O., B.S., LL.B., editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Physico-Clinical Magazine, </span><span class="font8">San Francisco, California. Dr. Colson says in his magazine for November, 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since a time when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, as might be said in legal parlance, alleged diagnoses have been made by clairvoyant, psychic, or other power by many. We find mention of it in our earliest histories and on down through the progress of civilization to our present time. We will not enter into a discussion of the merits or demerits of such alleged diagnoses. We just want to point out that such diagnoses are no part of the Electronic Reactions of Abrams. The latter depend for their occurrence upon certain well-defined scientific principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Colson, in the foregoing excerpt, has set forth a principle which Mr. Goodrich’s experiences show to be a fact; namely, that while the E.R.A. system is true and genuine, there are fakirs and frauds endeavoring to associate themselves with it and to take advantage of its good name and reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was late in the year of 1922 that a man in public life, an unusually broad-minded and intelligent man, a thinker, and a lover of his fellow men, one for w<sup>T</sup>hom I have great respect, advised me that, in his opinion, there would be extended opportunities of doing good to my fellow men if I were to take a course of study with Doctor Abrams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This gentleman knew Dr. Abrams personally, understood</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">his methods, and believed them to be thoroughly scientific, and as he is a keen observer and a sound reasoner and was willing to use his influence with Doctor Abrams to get me into his personal class, and did so use it, I took it to be the proper move that I should go to San Francisco for the purpose, and did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In December, 1922, I arrived in the far western city a living question mark. Not at that time fully convinced of the great value of E.R.A. in the treatment of disease, I was nevertheless willing to learn, and anxious to add to my practice of osteopathy all of the latest and best methods for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Sacramento St., opposite Lafayette Park, I found a modest two-story structure, without even a sign on the outside to indicate what was within. After passing through the big iron gates alongside the building I found an entrance with a door bell and on a small plate beside it merely the name “Dr. Albert Abrams”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After explaining my mission I -was ushered into the clinic where Doctor Abrams was performing what then seemed like miracles, but what, with a better knowledge of his methods, I now see was merely the practical application of truths with which he was familiar but of which, at the time, I knew next to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can help the reader a little at this point by explaining that the earth is a magnet. Navigation of earth and sea and sky is built upon this fact, and man is involved because he must live his life here on earth with lines of magnetic</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Tte QOLDEN AQE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">force streaming through him, from birth to death. The Abrams method takes advantage of this fact and uses it to help man in his weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8"> It is stated that if a human corpse is left on a float in a tank it will inevitably turn with its head to the north. Even through the lifeless body the lines of magnetic force will go in the direction they prefer. It is for this reason that it is better to sleep with the head to the north, when that is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' • When I entered the clinic room, which seats about sixty people, I found it filled with progressive physicians who had come from near by and from great distances to study at the feet of this man who has given the world the most wonderful method of curing human ailments that has thus far been devised. Although this man of genius has now gone into death, the legacy of knowledge which he left with mankind will long continue to bring health and happiness to the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this clinic, day after day, Doctor Abrams examined blood specimens, from his office and mailed to him from all over the world. He did not necessarily need to see the patients in order to be able to tell all about their physical condition. From a specimen of blood he was able to give a full diagnosis and outline a treatment. The following is the method pursued. The language may be somewhat technical, but will be sufficiently clear to most of your readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blood specimen, which is usually taken from the lobe of the patient’s ear, is first squeezed into a piece of clean white blotting paper. In making the diagnosis this blotting paper is placed in an instrument called the dynamizer, a small rubber container with an aluminum electrode connected with the ground. •’ The cover of this container is lined with aluminum and wired to a series of three rheostats called reflexophones, which in turn are connected to a band around the head of a human reagent or subject. This reagent is also grounded and his abdomen is used by the diagnostician, who uses the method of percussion to detect diseased conditions of the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The energy from the blood specimen in the dynamizer, as it passes through the rheostats and through the nervous system of the reagent, gives the clue to the condition of the blood. Reports on the abdomen may be detected by percussion (tapping with the finger tips) or by rubbing a charged rubber or glass rod over the skin of the abdomen. The diagnostician must also be in the circuit, which he does by placing’ his foot against the foot of the reagent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reagent or subject stands upon two pieces of grounded metal and faces the geographical west, in line with the rotation of the earth upon its axis. As the compass pulls to the north and south, which are the magnetic poles of the earth, in order to get greater energy from the blood specimen and from the reagent or subject, he faces in a direction opposite to the pull of the magnet. The reason why we advise sleeping with the head to the north is for the opposite reason, so that the patient may obtain greater relaxation, by having the earth’s lines of force travel through his body along the lines of least resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ In our examination of energy of the blood specimen we find that each disease has </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> vibratory rate of its own. It is commonly known that everything in nature vibrates, but it was for Doctor Abrams to detect, identify and measure these vibrations in the blood. When the electrons throughout the body are vibrating at their normal rates the body is in health or at ease, but if, for any reason, the electrons in any part or organ of the body suffer a disturbance which causes them to vibrate at other than their normal rates, this disturbed polarity causes a new formation, dis-ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Electromagnetic waves have no effect upon objects which are incapable of vibrating with them, but will produce a decided effect if the mechanism is sufficiently sensitive and accurately tuned. Hence there are many latent conditions of the blood that can be detected by the electronic reactions of Abrams and that would be unobservable by any other means now known. Inherited infections and vaccinations prepare the way for all kinds of diseases, especially tuberculosis and cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">; E.R.A. is identical with the principle in radio communication. The grounded dynamizer corresponds to the broadcasting station. The blood specimen ■ emits radiant energy through the sensitive cover of the dynamizer, just as radio waves are emitted by the sending aerial. The energy from the blood is measured by the coils of the rheostats, and with these we are able to tune out all wave lengths except the one with which we wish to deal, just as we do with any good radio receiving set. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reaction or result of the E.R.A. test is the report on the reagent or subject of the energy wave sent out by the blood specimen through the coils, and is produced upon the reagent’s abdomen by means of nerve reflexes. A nerve reflex is an involuntary impulse reflected over a system of nerves from an excited nerve center, caused independent of the conscious mind or will, as, for example, sneezing (nasal reflex) or batting the eye (conjunctival reflex). This nerve’s function is called reflex action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After concluding the diagnosis we take the same blood specimen and the same reagent, and leaving the rheostats set at the same vibratory rate we then connect the treatment machine or oscilloclast into the circuit and ascertain from it precisely what energy rate will best destroy the disease reaction. When we find on the treatment machine the proper number it quickly overcomes the disease reaction even when the electrode is held at a distance from the subject’s body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The oscilloclast is a box 12 inches by 14 inches arranged in such a way as to give forth a radio wave of 7.56 meters. It receives its power from the ordinary electric light socket. It will thus be seen that the legitimate E. R. A. machine and hook-up is not at all like the hook-up which Mr. Goodrich mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can understand the Abrams hook-up, with the human subject for the diagnosis of blood, but when I get away from the human subject I lose the fine qualities that are contained in the human reflexes for detecting fine emanations of blood energy. The college at San Francisco has offered a $10,000 reward for anyone who can produce a mechanical subject which can, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">identify, measure,</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">detect</span><span class="font8"> disease energy coming from a few drops of blood or transmitted direct from the human being (that is, the patient). No one, up to the present time, has succeeded in claiming this reward. Probably the Goodrich article is based on the idea of a mechanical subject. There is no button, to stick or not stick, in tire regular Abrams hook-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I conclude this article with an editorial from the March (1930) issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the ■American Electronic Research Association,</span><span class="font8"> supplemented by a paragraph from a similar editorial in the same journal for February, and a letter from the pen of Franklin M. Henry, of the College of Electronic Medicine, which are of interest and importance in this connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">INSTRUMENTS: It has become a matter of settled knowledge that the Abrams Oscilloclast delivers at its terminals:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(a) A very minute high frequency electrical current, detectable and measurable by sufficiently delicate instruments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(b) Energy that is in the range of radio-frequencies emitted in the form of successive, highly damped wave trains, the length of the wave being close to 7i/<sub>2</sub> meters.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The first, scientific, experimental demonstration of these facts was made, we believe, in the Burnett-Timkin Laboratory, Alpine, N. J., and they were given publicity in papers by Dr. J. C. Burnett and Physicist J. H. Hallberg in 1923, at which time the experimental evidence was shown before the Eastern Electronic Research Association and many guests at Hotel McAlpin, New York City. Similar evidence was presented by these gentlemen to the National Convention in 1924 as reported in the Journal for October, 1924, page 290 et seq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later much of this work was repeated and other experiments added at the McManis Laboratory, Kirksville, Mo., the result of which was to greatly strengthen the foundations of Electronic Medicine and confirm the confidence of its sincere students in the correctness of its fundamental propositions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was at this time particularly heartening to E. R. A. workers to receive proof through the efforts of Drs. McManis and the scientific work of Dr. Thomas Colson and Mr. F. M. Henry that their* practice rests on facts which can be “timed, weighed and measured” and therefore cannot be overcome by high-handed condemnation and ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the A. E. R. A. convention, 1925, (Journal, January, 1926, page 6) Dr. Thomas Colson, then of the McManis Laboratory, presented evidence of the actual tuning properties of the coils of the Abrams instruments. By string galvanometer curves thrown on a screen he gave a graphic illustration of the tuning effects of the different steps in the dial of the Oscilloclast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still more exacting experiments have now been carried out with reference to the Oscilloclast at the Abrams College in San Francisco by Dr, Colson and Mr. Henry as a result of which nearly all doubts and points of controversy have been cleared up. The tuning properties of the dial coils, based upon capacities and inductances, has been confirmed, as has also the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">®NOTE: To the physicist (a) and (b) may refer to the same tiling; but the clinician, having in mind his high frequency modalities, differentiates between that branch of physiotherapy and “Electronic'’ or radio-frequency wave therapy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">wave length of tiie radio-frequency of the Abrams instrument. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Studies have been carried out in the College Laboratory with reference to the best method of application of the Oseilloelast treatment, and. from this source we have the definite information that treatment is modified by the length of the treatment cord which connects the patient to the machine. This cord should be of standard size—-six feet long and No. 18 stranded wire for the original Oseilloelast. For the ‘ ‘ Improved Oseilloelast” the size of wire and the number of strands in the treatment cord make little difference but the length of this cord is of some importance.

<p><span class="font6">There have been from the first certain unknown quantities about the Abrams Oseilloelast and certain mystifying features of construction which appear ridiculous to the physicist. All such features are absent from the new Oseilloelast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the early questions raised was, Are the benefits of Oseilloelast treatment obtained through the law of destructive resonance as taught by Abrams? Engineer Ellis, of Chicago, after months of study of the electro-physics of the Abrams instruments announced his belief that the value of the treatment lay in the introduction into the body of a minute dosage of electricity in a form that enabled the molecular or atomic components of cells or plasma to acquire whatever electrons were needed to re-establish electronic equilibrium. Ue constructed instruments which were acceptable, as far as mechanical construction is concerned, to those who possessed the scientific training necessary to judge of such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• Certain others were thinking and working more or Jess along these same lines and the conception of electronic treatment held by many is that of “feeding electrons to the sick cells.” A number of machines based upon this idea were placed upon the market and these made a strong appeal on the claim that no tuning of the treatment is required and that diagnosis is entirely superfluous, so far as being related to the treatment is concerned, whereas in the Abrams method accurate diagnosis and exact tuning of the treatment to meet the individual requirements of the case are essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Abrams tried to lessen the labor of tuning by finding a “destructive rate” for each disease or infection. For example he found that the characteristic reaction he obtained from his specimens of tubercle bacilli in vitro were annulled by the Oscillo-clast when the dial was set on five. The same thing happened when the source of the reaction was a patient or a blood specimen. Therefore “rate 5” on the Oseilloelast became the “D. E.” for “T. B.” To this treatment many patients responded well and even unexpected cures were effected but it soon became evident that not all tubercular cases would be much benefited by this “D. R.” In many instances both symptoms and reactions would persist. Then finer tunings and individual tunings were introduced. In Abrams’ latest work this was accomplished by means of the supplementary coils and dials of the “Miero-Oscilloclast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During this period of development of specific tuning of the treatment it was found that by attaching the treatment cord which conveys the Oseilloelast energy to the patient to all three binding posts of the Oscillo-elast by means of branches, practically all the Micro rates, or any required tunings, were obtainable simply by tuning all three of the dial selector switches conjunctively but each to a different number. For example, the dial number 3, 4 and 5, when combined and carried through a standard treating cord to a patient have the same dissipating effect on the reactions as its micro equivalent—127.6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This three dial method of tuning has stood every comparative test as well as the hard test of several years’ practice and is now in daily use by a number of physicians. No actual scientific explanation of the tuning properties of the three dials used conjunctively has yet been offered. Doubtless it would be difficult to determine the total capacity and inductance values of the three dial coils operating together, with their connections, the treating cord and electrode. These values may be presumed, however, as in other cases, to correspond to the resistance values of the three dial coils when these are joined together and have their selector switches placed on the corresponding numbers. These latter values have been found to agree quite closely with those of Oseilloelast—Micro tunings which are experimentally equivalent in dissipating effect upon the reactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1924 Dr. Walter E. Elfrink, (Journal, September, 1924, page 210) sought to increase the power of the Oseilloelast by changing it to a closed circuit therapeutic instrument. This was done by closing the test lamp circuit so the light would flash with the swing of the “tie tock,” Then the two sides of the lamp circuit were joined through small fixed condensers to two added binding posts which, when connected through the treatment cords and patient, formed a “shunt” of the high circuit. The treatment circuit, containing the right hand rheostat of the unit, was tuned in the original manner. It was claimed that this “Elfrink hook up” made the treatment less subject to variation by environmental influences and increased the volume of energy flowing through the patient. After more than five years it cannot at this time be stated with certainty that the closed circuit) plan either is or is not superior to the method of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abrams—another item which reveals a lack of collaboration in our research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the fact that accurate therapeutic tunings are believed by most physicians who practice E. R. A. to be essential, the Oscilloclast has also been successfully used, as are the so-called self-tuning, or as are the non-tuned instruments. In the method of Dr. II. E. Jones the numbered contact posts or buttons of the tuning dial are all joined together by a bright copper wire which is first anchored to the stop pin at zero then passed from button to button around the dial, making one snug turn around each button. Patients are connected to the binding post in the usual manner and it is claimed the treatment may be distributed to more than one patient since all receive the same energy and each appropriates all he can absorb as would be the case if several patients were treated, under one big lap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On these “short-circuited” units patients may—• and should, it is claimed—-receive treatment many hours, even days, at a time. Ill effects are unknown. Treatment is administered as nearly continuously as circumstances warrant until disease reactions are negated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are able to state here as the result of personal observation and experiment that it is possible to render a patient negative of the common Abrams disease reactions, determined on the Abrams diagnostic circuit, by Oscilloclast treatment through the short-circuited unit. This is accomplished in a reasonable time with no attention whatever to tuning. Thus far we have not felt content to dismiss a case until we had abandoned the short-circuited unit and employed carefully tuned treatment for a time. It should be noted in this connection, however, that in Dr. Jones’ work the force of the treating energy is greatly augmented, it is claimed, by passing it through a certain arrangement of radio sets; also that synergistic measures, such as light, color and mechanical vibrations, are employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Capacity and inductance effects of the short-circuited unit have not been studied and we have no idea, in terms of physics, as to its tuning properties or how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are interested in this matter because we believe it to be for the public good and for the advancement of Electronic Medicine to have available a means whereby a large number of people may be benefited by having their major disease reactions taken care of at very little expense of money to them and of time and labor to our physicians. This being accomplished we will still have more than we can do in trying to save the difficult cases—to rescue those ready to perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us turn now to a brief discussion of the most delightful phase of the recent developments in E. R. A.—the standardization work that has been going on at the College during the last two years and which had its initiation previously at the McManis Laboratories at Kirksville. This work is delightful because the full, clear light of science illumines it, dispelling murky uncertainties. It is satisfying to substitute knowledge for supposition, fact for theory—to be able to give a reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new diagnostic set is a scientific instrument. Every detail is based upon painstaking, scientific determinations of cause and effect made by capable men who had the will to do it and ample facilities at their command. In construction and tuning properties this set is standardized. Each set is an exact duplicate of every other set. It is an encouragement and a joy to progressive workers who have had to do much of their work with crude instruments, the tuning properties of which were unknown or unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new Oscilloclast is likewise a scientific instrument of high standard and is well adapted to the best type of professional work in the Electronic field. The discriminating physician who has high aims in his work is bound to welcome this instrument and to derive much satisfaction from the use of a treatment machine which he can discuss with definiteness, pride and confidence with patients or visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is now generally known the “Improved Oscilloclast” is a two-meter wave machine, compared with the 71/2-meter wave of the old Oscilloclast. Experience thus far with the new machine is very encouraging as to clinical results obtained. It is too early at this writing to state with finality whether, as a general therapeutic proposition, the new machine is altogether superior to the old or not. It may be that the 71/2-meter wave at the force that represents the sending power of the old Oscilloclast will accomplish some things which the two-meter wave at the higher power of the “Improved Oscilloclast” cannot accomplish. On the other hand it is highly probable that the latter may be effective in certain instances in which the former would be useless, or nearly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of these points can be decided only as clinical experience accumulates. It is possible now, however, to state that the probabilities are that there, will be definite or specific uses for both the old and the new Oscilloclast waves and that in practice each will be complementary, or supplementary, to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief points of excellence of the “Improved Oscilloclast” may be enumerated as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(a) Easy portability and attachment to A. C. lighting system.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">January 11, 1930 Dr. Mae J. Work 34 Orange Street</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Doctor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not clear whether you refer to broadcasting treatment over a broadcasting station as Dr. Jones has done at various times, or whether you refer to broadcasting directly from the treatment apparatus, Assuming that you mean broadcasting treatment over a broadcasting station, your questions will be answered with this use in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Oscilloclast delivers a radio frequency wave of approximately 7^2 meters. A radio broadcasting station operates on a wave length between 200 and 600 meters. Any radio engineer can tell you that it is impossible to modulate a given wave length by a shorter wave length. Modulation can only be accomplished by a much longer wave length. The circuits of all broadcasting stations are designed in such a way that only wave lengths longer than 30,000 meters (sound waves) will effect modulation. It is quite evident from the foregoing that none of the radio frequency output of the Oscilloclast can be broadcast through any broadcasting station. It is true that if ;&lt;n Oscilloclast should be coupled to the input or microphone circuit of a broadcasting station, the station will be modulated at a frequency governed by the audio characteristics of the instruments. If a radio set were tuned in to a broadcasting station which was connected to an Oscilloclast in this manner, you would hear the sound of the tick-tock mechanism in the loud speaker, but this would not mean that any of the radio frequency current was being broadcast. These sound waves generated by the Oscilloclast are, of course, not of importance therapeutically, for the following reasons: A, Setting up different rates does not change the sound a particle. B. The sounds are not constant, but their charaetertistics are governed by the input voltage which is constantly fluctuating. O. In many installations the patient cannot hear, or at best can hear but faintly, the sound of the Oscilloclast. Yet in these cases the patients get well just as fast as if they could hear the sound wave. To my knowledge no one claims that the sound wave delivered by the Oscilloclast has therapeutic value, but it is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font6"> part of the Oscilloclast output that can possibly be broadcast from a broadcasting station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you refer to broadcasting’ treatment using the Oscilloclast itself (not in conjunction with a broadcasting station) you might be interested to know that it is true that the Oscilloclast does produce some effect for a short distance. This effect is not particularly important therapeutically because it drops off very rapidly, varying with the square of the distance. It is not efficient therapeutically except when connected to a patient with a wire but will dissipate reactions over a distance of from five to twenty feet. A few observers have reported this dissipation effect for a slightly greater distance, but their work has not been confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is impossible at the present time for any attachment whatsoever to amplify or increase the output of the Oscilloclast, as the wave length is too short to be amplified by any existing methods. The only way to secure increased output is by building a more powerful Oscilloclast, but at best this could only increase its broadcasting effect a short distance. None of the devices, which have been offered from time to time as means of increasing the output of the Oscilloclast energy, have any effect whatsoever towards producing such an increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is hoped that the above discussion will answer your questions satisfactorily.</span></p>

Mr. Duranty is said to be by no means, sure that Russia’s socialization plan will fail. He has been in Russia for years and is a trained and close observer.</span></p>

He estimates that the country now’ contains half a million drug addicts, one person in every twenty-eight of the population. The drug traffic with Egypt is mostly in the hands of the Swiss. One firm at Mulhouse in the year 1928 made and exported 10,872 pounds of heroin, which is more than twice the estimated requirements of the entire world for medicinal and scientific purposes.</span></p>

Until recently this great chain of stores had pushed west only as far as Omaha,, but they have now opened up on the Pacific coast and the Pacific part of the name will become a reality. The annual volume of A &amp;&nbsp;P sales is over a billion dollars. It is all cash. The surviving old style grocers are permitted to have the credit business, but when the purchasers have any cash they commonly use it to buy of the A &amp;&nbsp;P, sometimes forgetting all about their credit accounts until they run out of money again, when the old style grocer receives some more of the kind of business he does not want.</span></p>

This new system makes the burglar ring his own alarm, day or night. The rays are invisible to him. They may be used to asphyxiate him or to set off tear gas, as well as to sound silent alarms. Most progressive burglars have long since gone into the public utilities where the profits are greater and the risks are practically nil.</span></p>

The census taker will be around in a few days now. It seems to us that this sudden interest ought to be exchanged for a permanent one.</span></p>

The tokens varied from silver services worth $1,700 apiece to indoor golf sets worth $1,000, or almost anything else desired, and could be exchanged for cash on demand. The Sanitary District officials and their wives seem to have been the favored recipients of these costly presents and to have had lots of business to give to the donors at the expense of the taxpayers.</span></p>

It was one of the most effective means by which the ruling classes maintained themselves in power. The revolution consequently tended to sweep away both the Church and the State because they were inseparable. To the revolutionist the two institutions could not be distinguished.” Doctor Counts thinks it very unwise that the Russians were not invited to the London peace conference.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">FFICIAL figures for executions in Russia in the months of October and November, 1929, were 246. Of this number all but 99 were kulaks, that is, peasants, who had saved a little property and ■were trying to retain possession of it. Of the remainder, 32 were executed for religious activity, 3 were spies, 39 were enemies of the soviet government, and 25 were listed as specialists and saboteurs, that is, they were supposed to have aimed at ineffectiveness of soviet management of factories, etc.</span></p>

He thinks the pope has had plenty of previous opportunity to get excited and wonders why he waited until now, when the negotiations for what he sought have fallen through,</span></p>

A Japanese shirting was sold, in Manchester at 4-ld. a yard, the loom costs of which for the same material, apart from any other expenses, is 5£d. a yard. One Italian firm has 1700 looms running 24 hours a day, the whole production of which is shipped right into Manchester, where the working hours are 8 a day. Mr. Shaw Desmond, a British writer, says that Lancashire must immediately scrap her prehistoric machines, prehistoric productive methods and prehistoric captains of industry or she is going to be wiped off the map. He points out that Italy has the very best and newest machinery and has virtually gained the upper hand of the artificial silk industry of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font8">URING the Civil War a certain general told his soldiers they might take the top rail from a fence to build a fire wherewith to keep warm during one of the cold nights. They took the top rail all right, and the top kept retreating until there were no rails left. Something like this recently happened in Zude, Hungary. Each family took a tree out of the municipal forest. By the time they finished the job there was not a tree left, and the government sent to prison every one of the sixty-eight heads of families in the community. This is probably the first time a complete forest was stolen.</span></p>

America is the richest country in the world. That’s fine. But the secretary of the Bowery Y.M.C.A. said: “We’ve had to turn hundreds away this month, and they don’t know where to go. They have never been hoboes. In bread lines tonight you’ll see fellows you’d never expect, clean, decent young men. They come to us so desperate they’re willing to try any work, but even the roughest, humblest jobs this winter simply can’t be found, for the men who hold them won’t leave. So these others come to us, young office clerks and salesmen, who don’t know how to sell themselves.

<p><span class="font8">Lewis E. Lawes, of Sing Sing, made the statement that although there are in the United States eleven thousand murders a year, fewer than one hundred persons pay the death penalty, and if well provided financially it is almost safe to say that they never pay it. There are now 125,000 men in prison in the United States, a number equal to the country’s standing army, yet the real schemers and plotters are rarely if ever within prison walls. Fifteen million persons have been arrested and one-third of these have served some time in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Witnessing in Newfoundland</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8"> FRIEND in Michigan sends us letters of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">one of the Bible Students engaged in the ■witness work in Newfoundland, the land of fishermen, and fish. It seems from his letters that the soil is fertilized with fish which is left upon the surface to decay, and, as a consequence, in the summer time, the whole land is redolent with fish perfume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The letters are filled with experiences of two courageous young men engaged in navigating foggy and rock-bound waters. In one instance the little motor boat came within a few feet of an iceberg, a crash with which would probably have meant death to all on board. The worst of it was that the berg did not show up until the little boat was almost upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In another place the propeller shaft pulled out of the coupling and the boat went ashore at high tide, but by dint of working all night it was gotten off early the next morning without fresh mishap. In an instance where the engineer had failed to open the gasoline valve it was found that a floating log was just about to enter the propeller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On coming to a strange port, there were two entrances to the harbor and the King’s messengers knew not which was the right one. An error might mean the loss of the little craft, as Newfoundland’s shores are rocky. At the right t</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font8">e another boat came along to guide the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In one community the Devil’s cry of “False prophets!” nearly resulted in an attack on the inoffensive bearers of the best of good tidings, but the endangered one walked bravely through the midst of the gathering opposers, smiling and speaking kindly to them as he passed, unharmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such are some of the experiences in six months of earnest endeavor in Newfoundland, in which a good portion of the northeastern shore of this large island was planted with the seeds of truth. Books to the number of 2,134 were placed on the trip. No doubt all who are faithful will some day see good results from this trip.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">LFALFA is not something new. It was cultivated in Greece as early as 400 B. C. and has always been much appreciated by the Arabs. They called it </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">alfafa,</span><span class="font8"> which means “father of all foods”. It has been grown in America for seventy-five years and is considered </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font8"> food for cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Alfalfa roots have been known to penetrate the soil to a depth of 125 feet. It is a legume, like peas or beans, and its stems have been </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">kn</span><span class="font8">own to reach a length of fifty feet. The deep rootage brings to the plant ten times as much of the valuable minerals as is found in the grains.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Dietitians claim that potassium is the elixir of life, and the claims made for alfalfa tea seem</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to suggest that they are not far away in their calculations. Tea made from alfalfa leaves has a bitter taste, but causes increased secretion of the kidneys, increased peristaltic action of the bowels, increased appetite, increased assimilation of foods, and increased weight. A large drink produces a sensation of warmth in the stomach, and a good night’s rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For years it has been known that cattle and horses grow better if given some alfalfa every day along with their hay and grain. An experiment was made in Kansas with fourteen little pigs. Seven of them, fed on corn alone, averaged 75 pounds apiece in 180 days. The other seven, fed on corn and alfalfa hay, averaged 185 pounds apiece in the same time. In the alfalfa-fed hogs the bones were twice as large and three times as strong, and the muscles were firmer and less fat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The famous dietitian Dr. Frank McCoy says: “For several years I have been advising my patients to eat alfalfa, if they could get it fresh, as it makes a very delicious salad or addition to a combination salad.” A noted dentist said: “Alfalfa is especially rich in vitamins and minerals which are important in keeping the teeth firm and strong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Government Bulletin No. 247 says: “The results show that 90% of the potassium, 85% of the magnesium, 75% of the phosphorus, 50%</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The QOLDEN AQE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">of the nitrogen and 40% of the calcium (lime) contained in the dried alfalfa plant are soluble in water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who have used alfalfa claim wonderful results in cases of lumbago, rheumatism, hardening of the arteries, tuberculosis, dropsy, bladder trouble, prostatitis, blood disorders, and all those other troubles whose name is legion, which start in the intestines, where all diseases start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Luther Burbank once said: &quot;Alfalfa is a vastly different thing from ordinary hay as people usually think of it. It contains some of the most important nutritive substances known and in greater abundance, the salts, so especially important in the nourishment of human beings, especially children, such as potassium, sodium, magnesium and the phosphates and sulphates.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A boarding-house keeper tried alfalfa tea on her boarders. They drank it without comment, noticing no difference in the taste of the new tea, but in a few days their appetite had in-, creased prodigiously. The tea was good for the boarders, but hard on the landlady’s larder. As a milk producer and general tonic in maternity cases, alfalfa tea, according to the statement of a prominent physician, F. L. Wilson, is practically infallible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Science Puzzles over Child with X-Ray Eyes,” the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Searchlight</span><span class="font8"> publishes an article which we reproduce below. The correct explanation of this is that this lad is demonized and the powers which he is using are clairvoyant or demoniacal powers. The Scriptures alone provide the explanation. Of course the scientists are puzzled. In the main they absolutely close their eyes and ears to what the Lord would tell them on these and kindred subjects. These eyes are not the eyes of Benito Paz at all. The demons see the articles and convey the information to the mind of the child. He indeed thinks that he sees them, but he does not see them at all. They are seen by cleverer eyes than his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A miracle of Nature, which has called for the great-' est attention and surprise in professional and lay circles all over Europe, has been brought before the public by Dr. Pedro Niel; an oculist in Madrid, Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Niel has been treating and observing the child in question for the last two years, and recently held a lecture in Paris before a great number of doctors who were greatly astonished by his communications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The child is called Benito Paz. The father did not notice anything extraordinary about his child up to the fifth year. When he began to teach the A B C to the little chap he noted the ability of the child, who had just acquired the knowledge of letters and spelling, to see through the closed book and spell out the words on the different pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The father at first suspected that the child was gifted with an exceptional memory, and was glad to have .such an offspring in his family, but this belief was rudely shattered. He was looking for a button that was missing on his coat and the little chap laughingly declared that the missing button was in the cigarette case. Then the father remembered that he put the button in the cigarette case the day before, but how did the child know that? Cross-examined, the boy declared that he could see through the cigarette case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The father then placed a number of cigarettes in the case, closed the same, and asked the boy to count them. Each time the child was able to give the correct number of the cigarettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One month later the father went to Madrid and called on Dr. Niel, relating to him all the previous circumstances connected with, the child. The doctor examined the eyes of the child, but could see nothing unusual with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He arranged with the father to leave the child at his house for the purpose of a careful and scientific examination, to which the father consented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He found that the boy was able to read letters enclosed in three or four envelopes, to read books through the bound covers, to tell the contents of a metal-box and even to tell the color of different items enclosed therein, as well as accurately describe the contents of the doctor’s pockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That this is not a clairvoyance but actual seeing ability, is demonstrated by the fact that the child can see through metal, paper and cloth, but is unable to see through wood, which effectively stops the penetrating rays of the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The scientists are absolutely unable to explain this power of penetration and are puzzled to find an explanation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Still Something About Latvia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By D. L. Cranston</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">WING to my having traveled much of late</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have only recently had an opportunity of reading Mr. Auerbach’s article on “Something More About Latvia”, in which he expresses objection to my statement that “The people of Latvia are hard-working. They do the work, and a few traders, mostly Jews, reap the profit of their labor”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The staple industry of Latvia is farming, carried on mostly by Latvians. As in most other countries, the farmers do not reap the benefits of their labors, the profits of which go to the big business traders.. There are more Jews in big business in Latvia than those of any other race. So my statement is according to the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Auerbach asserts that I probably obtained my information about Latvia from “some good Letts whose views coincide with most alcoholic European ignoramuses, that is, that the cause of the people’s poverty is the Jewish traders”. To begin wfith, I never expressed in my article that the poverty of the people of Latvia was due to the Jewish traders, but to the fact that, the country is controlled by the earthly part of the Devil’s organization, the financiers, politicians and clergy. It is true, nevertheless, that the Jews control finance in Latvia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Neither did I obtain my information from the source he mentions, but from four different sources: (1) from some German colporteurs who had for a year or two gone from door to door among the people; (2) from my own personal observations, many of which were made while colporteuring; (3) from a book on Latvia by the editor of the now defunct English paper, the Riga </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times;</span><span class="font8"> and (4) from the figures and statistics issued by the Latvian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am a native of Scotland, yet I did not know the true conditions of the people of my own native land until, on becoming a colporteur, I went from door to door with the message of the Kingdom. It was then I learned the truth about the slums of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and of other towns of Scotland, and saw for myself the conditions of oppression under which the kindly people of the highlands and islands of Scotland have so long suffered. I mention this to show that it is possible for one to be born and brought up in a land and yet be quite ignorant of the true conditions prevailing there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first two sources of my information about Latvia are reliable. The author of the third source is an Englishman, so neither Jew nor Latvian. His hook is, therefore, probably more reliable than, one written by either of the latter two. The Jews have members of their own race in the Latvian parliament. The statistics of the government of Latvia come from a body on which the Jews and their interests are represented. I, therefore, did not secure any of my information from sources which misrepresent the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not true that the Jews of Latvia are bankrupt and kept alive by the help of their foreign friends and relatives. Everywhere I have gone in Latvia the Jews are prosperous. Visit the famous Riga Strand, the holiday resort some few miles from the city of Riga, and a suburb of the same, and you will find the Jews abounding. This fact was specially noted by a Swedish friend of mine who spent a month’s holiday there. Travel by railway sleeper and you will find many Jews traveling with you. The vast majority of Latvians cannot afford sleeper fare. Visit Schwarz cafe in Riga and you will find a large proportion of those frequenting it are Jewish, well dressed and showing, by what they eat, that they are far from poverty-striken. Then remember that they are only 4.5 percent of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have nothing whatever against the Jews. I admire their business acumen, for a Jew will get on in business where others fail. You will never see a J eve working on an unprofitable job; that is why they do not take to farming in Latvia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Latvian republic was formed in troublous times. Riga was in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who despoiled the city and factories of machinery and everything of value. This left the city and businesses bankrupt. This was the work of the Bolsheviks, and not the work of the Latvians. The Latvian government, struggling against poverty and lack of finance, has restored the country to a measure of economic prosperity. Many Jews lost out in 1918-19 when the Bolsheviks left ruin behind them. But the same Jews have made secure their position in the measure of renewed prosperity. The Bolsheviks brought ruination to the Jews of Latvia in 1918-19. The republic of Latvia has brought them prosperity since.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark31"></a>How to Build a House Car</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">Y WORK is advertising the King and the Kingdom. I am a pioneer colporteur and work mostly in business districts in the most isolated parts. After traveling three years with a Ford touring car, I removed the body and built a small house on the same car. It has been such a great help to me that I would like to pass the information on to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I had figured on building such a ear for two years, but thought it would not be as convenient as a touring car, but I have found it to be as convenient in every way. Weighs 1,675 pounds, empty. I can climb a twenty-five percent steeper grade, and it looks just as neat as a touring ear. If I am in town or fifty miles away with a jug of water and lunch I can stop over night with no room rent to pay. My expenses for the past four months were $110 less than for the same months one year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In starting to build this house I removed the old body, windshield and all, right up to the dashboard. Then I bolted two 2 x 4’s lengthwise on frame, then four 2 x 4’s crosswise, then nailed the floor on in all parts. I used soft pine or fir for floor. The 2 x 4’s should be free from knots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Size on outside: width feet, height 5 feet, length 8 feet, all corners square, except that the banisters in front are 6 inches shorter, and roof boards are bow’ed down in front for 3| feet back. I used 1x3 and 1x4 for all crossbars on roof ends, door, window frames and upright pieces on the sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As lumber for sides, ends and roof, I used £-inch crating, the same as used to make orange boxes. Six-inch material is the best for this. I used nails long enough to clinch. I bolted all joints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gas tank inside to left of steering wheel, 8 inches higher than the floor; one door, size 2x4 feet, with glass window made in. Two small windoves: one above gas tank, one in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Frank Day (Colporteur)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">back large enough to crawl through. The windows open on inside, are hung with two small hinges and fastened with wooded buttons. The windshield is hung with two hinges, opens on inside, and can be hung up to the roof in warm weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just back of steering wheel is the table, 2 x 2-J feet. I use it for both writing and eating. It fastens with two small chains, and hooks up close to the wall. I have shelves on the sides and ends that hold 200 books and booklets and two suitcases of clothes. I use a strong cot 2| x 6 feet, with legs that fold in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After getting up in the morning the first thing I do is make up my bed; then with three cross straps nailed to the frame of cot I buckle it in place; then the cot will sit on edge on top of the box built 10 inches higher than the floor over the rear wheel, and with snaps I hook it to the wall. This takes up just 8 inches and comes just even with the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For a scat to drive on I got a common round-back dining chair and sawed the legs off to the right length. I got five coils out of an old Ford cushion and put them on the chair and covered them. Don’t fasten chair to floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A small “Perfection” oil heater is a good stove for this kind of house in cold weather; but you will have to leave the window open a little. If roofing is used to cover, paint top with tar, sides with house paint, dark color, as light color will crack and show the roofing. If duck is used, to cover, raise the duck 3 inches in the middle on the roof; otherwise with heat inside it will leak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two could use a house of this size by putting their baggage outside. With one man, he can keep ten boxes of books of fifty each inside on the floor when the cot is down. I built my own; and the material, all told, in Cheyenne, .Wyo., cost only $42.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font8">URING the past month I have talked with college students, professors, school teachers, and travelers, but as yet have found no one who can by any known simple way check up on multiplication. The following method is now known. Let us take a simple question and prove </span><span class="font7">its answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">32746 - add 3-2-74-6 = 22 = 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 273 - add 2-7-3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 12 = 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">12 or (added) 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8939658 - add answer = 48 — 12 — 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another illustration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Multiply 27162 by 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">27162 - added = 18 = 9 Multiply</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">46 - added = 10 = 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">162972</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">108648</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1249452 - added = 27 or adding 2 and 7 = 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will readily see that you add the figures in your number to be multiplied, and if your answer is in two or more figures you add the answer until the final answer is one figure. You will see by above that 2, 7, 1, 6, 2, when added equals 18; add 1 and 8 and your answer is 9. Then add the digits of the number by which you are multiplying, 4 and 6, and you get 10. You must always have one figure; therefore, 1 and 0 are 1. After having brought your two figures down to a digit you are now ready to multiply, so you multiply 9 by 1 and your answer is 9. Now see if your real answer is the same. 1, 2, 4, 9, 4, 5, 2, added equals 27. But you must have only one figure, so you again add 2 and 7, which equals 9. If your two digits multiply and give the same answer as the addition of your large answer when brought to a digit you are assured that your multiplication is correct. Just try a few simple questions and see, say 12 x 3:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 - added = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;Multiply</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3 - added = 3</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">J HAVE had a number of reports about puppies that were only a few days old, where tests were made by leaving milk stand in an aluminum dish for twelve hours and also in an enamel dish for the same period of time and then putting both pans at the end of the room and letting the puppy loose at the other end of the room. Every time the puppy will go to the enamel dish, even though he has been placed nearer to the other one. A three-day-old puppy usually doesn’t know much, but I believe there are times when they are more intelligent than some editors.</span></p>

This word in Swedish is pronounced devil, and means devil. It is very cold in Gefle in the wintertime, due to the fact that in midwinter the sun shines only from 11 to 1 o’clock.

<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Free Economy—A New Form of Money</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N 1891, Silvio Gesell, of Luxemburg, after four years’ business experience in Argentina, came to the conclusion that a new form of money can be devised which will preserve all the advantages of competition and private enterprise that have been exploited to the full under the capitalist system, but which will eliminate the social injustice of unearned income, will do away with the wretched and wholly un-scriptural system of interest on money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We give a little space to proving this point, that interest on money is unscriptural. In the first place, the word “interest” does not occur in the Bible. The only word of the sort is “usury”, but usury and interest are one and the same thing. Only theologians have distorted this matter in the minds of others and persuaded them that interest is right but usury is wrong. No such distinction appears in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God himself, addressing Moses on Mount Sinai, commissioned him to say to the people, “If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shaft not be to him as an usurer, neither shaft thou lay upon him usury.” This verse shows that it is all right to lend money, and the next succeeding verse shows that it is even all right to take security for the payment of the loan; but there must be no charge for the use of the money. Even the security may not be kept over night, if it is in the form of a garment that the borrower might need.—Exod. 22: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another form of the same command is found in Leviticus 25:35-37, and reads: “And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou shaft relieve him; yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God: that thy brother may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To make sure that the Israelites would not forget this command it was given them yet once again in Deuteronomy 23:19, 20: “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shaft not tend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This concession, that the Israelite might lend to a stranger and accept usury or interest on the loan, is withdrawn by the Lord himself, in Luke 6:34, 35: “And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for* sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the passage from Deuteronomy 23:19, 20, above cited, the words “lend upon usury” are from a Hebrew word, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">weshelt,,</span><span class="font8"> which literally means “to strike with a sting (as a serpent)”. That this is manifestly the true meaning of the word is evident from Genesis 49:17, Amos 9:3, Jeremiah 8:17, Ecclesiastes 10:8, 11, and Proverbs 23:32, where it is translated “bite” and refers to a serpent’s sting. Hence, Sculpturally, to lend money at interest is to strike with the sting of the serpent, the same serpent that deceived mother Eve in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That the interest system will be annihilated in Armageddon is the Lord’s own declaration, in Isaiah 24:1, 2: “Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty; and maketh it -waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. And it shall be, as with the people, so -with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The word translated “giver of usury” in this passage is the Hebrew </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">nasha,</span><span class="font8"> which Dr. Strong suggests is perhaps identical with a similar word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">nasha</span><span class="font8"> which means “to lead astray, mentally or morally, to seduce, beguile or deceive” (through the idea of imposition); and certainly leads to the conclusion that the whole interest system is wrong, mentally and morally, and that by it the serpent has been able to seduce, beguile and deceive mankind into a wholly evil financial arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Israelites never lived up to Jehovah’s instructions regarding interest. Among those that gathered to David in the cave of Adullam was “every one that was in debt”; and this</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">means, and is from the word which means, those that had borrowed money on interest or ■usury, and who had thus been led astray, seduced, beguiled or deceived. Evidently they gathered about David because they knew that the arrangement into which they had been led, of paying usury or interest on borrowed money, was an unscriptural one, an evil one, a devilish one, an illegal one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is significant that we are living in the “Elisha” era of the church’s experience and that one of Elisha’s acts was to lift the burden which had fallen upon a poor widow’ of one of the sons of the prophets. She came to Elisha saying, “Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear [Jehovah] : and the creditor [literally, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">usurer]</span><span class="font8"> is come to take unto him my trvo sons to be bondmen.” (2 Ki. 4:1) She had but a pot of oil. The oil, miraculously increased in quantity, was used to pay the debt. The word here rendered “creditor” is the same word that is rendered “'usurer” in Exodus 22: 25 and “extortioner” in Psalm 109:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Nehemiah came from Babylon to his previously repatriated brethren in Palestine he very properly gave heed to their cries that they were mortgaged out of house and home and had even borrowed money to pay their taxes. He rebuked the nobles and rulers for exacting usury and demanded that they leave it off, and they agreed to do it. Then Nehemiah publicly shook his lap and said, “So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.”—Neh. 5: 3-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Lord, 'who shall abide in thy tabernacle? 'who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speak-eth the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not ■with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear [Jehovah], He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">He that putteth not out his money to usury [interest],</span><span class="font8"> nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.” (Ps. 15) It does not seem necessary to add anything to such a statement except that it most certainly and most positively applies </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That the Lord is watching this thing is plain from Proverbs 28:8-101 “He that by usury [interest] and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law [on this subject], even his prayer shall be abomination. Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way [on this subject], he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jeremiah understood very well that usury (interest) is displeasing to God. Hear his complaint: “Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.”—Jer. 15:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Prophet Ezekiel goes into this matter in great detail in the eighteenth chapter. There lie that “'hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase” is classed with the idolater, the defiler of his neighbor’s wife, the oppressor of the poor and needy, the spoiler by violence, the withholder of pledges, and the committer of abominations. In various language this is mentioned three times in the one chapter, and all such are promised destruction. “Shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.”—Ezek. 18:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How then shall we explain the Lord’s references to usury in the parables of the pounds and talents? (Luke 19:23; Matt. 25:27) The answer must not be that Jesus came to set aside the Father’s own laws. He did not. He came to magnify the law and make it honorable. But Jesus was not speaking of literal money in either of these parables. lie was speaking of Kingdom privileges and responsibilities, and was using the common but illegal practice of usury to illustrate His point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the United States, as a result of the interest system, “90 percent of the wealth is owned by 13 percent of the people: 1 percent of the people owning 59 percent of it: 77 percent of the people owning no smallest portion of it: 50 percent of the national income going to capital” ; so says Dr. Theophil Christen in his little 52-page book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Free Economy,</span><span class="font8"> translated by Philip Pye, M. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Christen goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A very simple calculation shows whether an individual is a victim or a beneficiary of unearned income. The total income of the United States in the year 1918 was, for example, 58 billion dollars, of which 40-50% was unearned income. Unearned income therefore amounted to at least 23.2 billion dollars or, with a population of 104,200,000, to 223 dollars per head of the population. This is the amount of the annual tribute paid by the worker to the nonworking- capitalist, directly in the form of rent, and indirectly as rent and interest in the price of everything- he buys. If we take the case of a worker with a wife and two children, his share of the burden of unearned income., is four times 223 or 892 dollars, which, with interest at 5%, represents a capital of 17,840 dollars. If the worker possesses less capital than this he is a victim of interest, paying more rent and interest than he receives. Only if he accumulates more than 17,840 dollars capital does he begin to benefit by interest—but how many workers possess this amount of capital when “77% of the people own no smallest portion of the national wealth”? The overwhelming majority of the population are victims, not beneficiaries of unearned income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Christen points out that history is determined by currency, and that the real reason Rome fell is because “the Spanish silver mines upon which Rome depended for its currency became exhausted about the time of Augustus. The result was a gradual fall of prices, which paralyzed industry and commerce. As no other source of currency was discovered, this fall of prices continued all through the Middle Ages and put back the clock of progress a thousand years. Only after the discovery of America, when gold and silver began to flow in from Mexico, was progress resumed and later intensified by the invention of paper-money”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Silvio Gesell and Doctor Christen propose a new currency for the entire world, which consists of notes which depreciate a fixed amount, one thousandth of their value, every week, at the expense of their holders. The holder of a note affixes a stamp to it every Saturday, after which it passes at its full face value for another ■week. New bills are issued each year, the old currency being withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Free money must circulate. None will hoard it, because it depreciates in value every week. The holder will always pass it on for the purchase of produce, the payment of wages, the settlement of old debts or the loaning of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the first case the forced circulation of Free-Money increases the demand for produce and so stimulates production; in the second case it increases the demand for labor and therefore raises the rate of wages; in the third case it reduces the demand for loans; and in the fourth ease it increases the offer of loans. Thus the rate of interest which falls after the stabilization of the currency is still further reduced by the introduction of Free-Money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Free-Money paralyzes the influence of money-hoarders upon the measures of the National Currency Office; it must circulate even if the rate of interest falls to zero, for it is better to lend money to a safe debtor, without interest, than to hoard it and lose the legal depreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be noted that the legal depreciation affects only the money-tokens, that is, the Free-Money notes, not the assets which money represents, such as deposits in saving-banks, loans, mortgages, insurance policies, etc. These are the real medium of saving and are much safer than before, since the money received upon repayment has lost none of its purchasing power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The depreciation of Free-Money is a small discomfort; the beneficial effect of the new form of money, in conjunction with stabilization of the currency, is very great. Stabilization of the currency gives Free-Money a fixed purchasing power, to the advantage not alone of wage-earners and creditors, but of employers, who can fix their plans for the future; whereas under the present system they never know how long to trust to a wave of trade prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Free-Money has yet another advantage. The stabilization of the currency might with some show of reason be reproached with depriving trade of the beneficial stimulus of a general rise of prices. One could reply that the security of economic life given by a fixed general level of prices is of greater value. But Free-Money does still better. An annual depreciation of 5.2% in money is equivalent to a general annual rise of prices of 5.2%. Free-Money gives fixed prices and at the same time the desired stimulus to trade. We follow the example of the inflationists, without however injuring wage-earners and creditors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">America. The claim that it is derived from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Amt-Eric’'</span><span class="font8"> is so far-fetched that I marvel that sober, reasonable folk can entertain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first Spaniards to reach Central America found a tribe of Indians inhabiting the main chain of the mountains there.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font8"> In LB.S.A', &quot;books and lectures, it is claimed that Christ is now present, and that He has taken His power and begun His reign. My question is this: Does not the Bible teach that everybody will see Him at His second coming, and that His reign will be one of peace and righteousness ? Surely no one sees Jesus now, and there is no peace or righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> This is an excellent question, and the Bible answers it satisfactorily. Careful observers agree that there was never so much crime, lawlessness, selfishness, immorality, oppression and injustice as at the present. There was never so much neglect of Bible study, nor lack of reverence for God, as at the present time. Repeatedly the Bible tells us that these conditions will prevail in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">last days</span><span class="font8"> of Satan’s power and reign and the beginning of the establishment of Christ’s kingdom. Men overlook these scriptures, because they have been taught that men, using the various church systems now existing, will have the world all converted when Christ comes. There is no warrant for such a claim anywhere in the Bible. Men cannot convert the w’orld. Jesus Christ will accomplish that much-to-be-desired result during His 1,000-year kingdom, which is now just at the door. The acknowledged facts are that the world is in a worse condition than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, let us note the prophecies bearing on this point. In Luke 18:8 we read: “When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth ?” Again, in 2 Timothy 3:13 we read: “But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.” This is a point blank denial of the oft-repeated assertion that the world is getting better and better. Also, in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 is the statement that “in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers ... unthankful, unholy ... having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof”. Still again, in 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 we read of the second coming of the Lord, that Satan will be very active, “with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ... that they all might be [condemned] who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other texts tell us that Jesus will dash the nations to pieces, destroy their armies, and destroy all the war weapons at His coming. Thus the facts now existing and the Bible prophecies agree. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus we can see that mankind has tried to convert the world, that their efforts have failed, and that when Christ takes His power and begins His reign it will be in a worse condition than ever. This being true, it is manifest that the first part of Christ’s reign will be a destructive work, destroying the old, corrupt, selfish, wicked and oppressive systems of Satan. This is exactly what the Bible points out. In Matthew 24, Jesus gives His disciples some proofs that He would be present, and the first proof is found in verse 7, which reads: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows” (birth pangs). These were given as evidences that Jesus was present. Why will the people need such evidences? The answ<sup>7</sup>er is, Because they cannot </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font8"> Jesus, because He is a divine, spirit being, and hence they must have some tangible evidences, -which will appeal to their natural senses. These tangible evidences will be the beginning of the w<sup>T</sup>ork of destroying the present evil conditions and systems. This work of destruction began in 1914 and is proceeding rapidly and surely. The old order is to be dashed to pieces, and no human power can perpetuate it. Men perceive that the old order is collapsing, and in feverish excitement are forming leagues of nations, federations of churches, and giant mergers of business, as w<sup>7</sup>ell as a giant international bank, hoping that by these expedients they can perpetuate the present order, with all its corruption and oppression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If it is true that Jesus has been present since the year 1914, then it must be admitted that nobody has seen Him with his natural eyes. The only way that He can be seen is by these signs or evidences, which Jesus declared would indicate His presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Revelation 11:17,18 w<sup>T</sup>e read: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” Here again, we are told that the evi-deuce of Christ’s presence is the fact that the nations were angry, pointing again to the year 1914, when the whole world became angry, and the World War began. Thus, for over sixteen years, Christ has been present, unseen by men, </span><span class="font7">but </span><span class="font8">plainly revealed to those who are students </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">the Bible and looking for the evidences which Jesus said would be a proof of His presence. Those who are looking for these evidences are Scripturally called WATCHMEN. It is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">only these watchmen</span><span class="font8"> that will be aware of the presence of the Lord, until He will be revealed to everybody, in “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, which will soon- envelop the whole earth. When this battle has completely destroyed the present evil organization, it will be apparent to everybody that Christ has taken His power and begun His reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking of the time when Christ takes His power, Daniel, in chapter 12, verse 10, says: ‘The wise shall understand, but the wicked shall not understand/ Of course, if Christ could be seen with the natural eye, the wicked </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">would </span><span class="font8">understand. Speaking of His second advent, Jesus said, in John 14:19, “Yet a little while, and the wmrld seeth me no more.” In Revelation 1: 7 we read that “every eye shall see him”, but the Greek word is incorrectly translated “see”. It is properly translated </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">discern.</span><span class="font8"> This means that when Christ destroys the present organization, everybody will </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">discern</span><span class="font8"> that He is present, but will </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not see</span><span class="font8"> Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, in Matthew 24:38,39, Jesus said: “As in the days that were before the flood, they were.eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">knew not,</span><span class="font8"> until the flood came, and took them all away: so shall also the. [presence] of the Son of man be.” Bear in mind that for many years Noah was telling the people of the coming flood, and yet this text says, “[They] knew not, until the flood came and took them all away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This means that they did not believe Noah, and were not convinced until it was too late. Just so now: For many years Bible Students have been warning the people of the coining Battle of Armageddon, and the people pooh at it and will not be convinced until the great battle takes place. Then it will be too late, just as it was in Noah’s day. A very few, however, are heeding the warning, weighing the evidences, and are being convinced, before the great destructive battle occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus do the Scriptures agree with conditions now existing, describing them accurately. They tell us that the world will never see Jesus in the flesh again; and they tell us in most positive language that the beginning of Christ’s reign will be a time of trouble such as was not from the beginning of creation, no, nor ever shall be. After the destruction of the present evil organization, and the binding of Satan for a thousand years, the rest of the reign of Christ will witness peace and righteousness prevailing everywhere.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Skidding to a Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">A SUBSCRIBER in Texas writes of a wild -CA ride to a 'winter convention. Once the car skidded on the ice, turning halfway around, barely missing a tall post. The second time it turned completely around, barely avoiding a ditch. A little while later one of the back wheels came off and the ear made good time for a way, traveling on three wheels on the icy pavement. More colporteurs following the first ones picked up the lost wheel and helped restore it to its place, and away the conventioners went again, to skid some more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These conventioners left Dallas at 6.30 a.m., hoping to hear Judge Rutherford at 7.30 p.m. the same day in San Antonio, 300 miles away. They arrived in time for the public question meeting at 1 p.m. the next day. Two other cars went into the ditch en route, but nobody was seriously hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It takes a hardy northerner to stand a balmy southern winter. The lady who wrote us about this trip says, amusingly and convincingly: “I got up out of bed to take this hazardous ear ride, having been sick with influenza, and recuperating for some weeks. Although I had to wear three woolen dresses and two coats and couldn’t take a dose of medicine, since it was packed in a suitcase on the fender, I was almost well of my cold when I reached San Antonio.” We might add that, in our judgment, that is the very best way to take medicine. Take it on the fender or not at all.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Why This Gospel Must Be Preached</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Broadcast from Station VZBBB, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVATT the Most High sent His beloved Son Jesus to earth to preach the gospel. Jesus began His work on earth by preaching the gospel. He said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> that sent me.” (John 6:38) And on another occasion He said: “My doctrine is not </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font8">ne, but his that sent me.” (John 7:16) Again, He said: “The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.” (John 14: 24) God appointed Jesus to the high office of chief executor of His purposes. He clothed Jesus Christ with all power and authority both in heaven and in earth. (Matt. 28:18) These scriptures prove beyond any doubt that Jesus spoke with authority and that His words import absolute verity. The commandments which Jesus gave to His followers carry the same weight and importance as those given by Jehovah, because such are commandments from God uttered by and through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Near the closing days of the ministry of Jesus Christ on earth He gave commandment to His disciples in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Gospel”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Take notice that He said </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">this gospel,</span><span class="font8"> plainly showing that He meant some specific thing. How may we know what He meant by the term “this gospel”? By examining the context. The occasion was this: He was sitting on the side of the Mount of Olives when His disciples came to Him privately and propounded to Him a question. Their question was this: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign [evidence] of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” (Matt. 24:3) Why would they ask Him such a question? Because Jesus, during the three years that He had been with them, had stressed the fact that some time the world would end and that He would come again and gather His faithful ones to Himself and set up His kingdom. The faithful disciples were looking forward 'with great expectation to that wonderful time. The knowledge that would come to them or any one else, fixing the time about which they inquired, would be good news and therefore a gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In reply to their question Jesus warned them against false Christs, meaning those who would appear claiming to be God’s anointed ones and who would claim that they were going to set up God’s kingdom. He warned them that a mere war or rumor of war would be no evidence that the important time had arrived. He said further in answer to their question: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows ” —Matt, 24:7,8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The testimony of Jesus and His apostles all shows that the second coming of Christ and the kingdom would be many years after the death of Jesus and of the apostles. This proves that the words of Jesus were spoken not so much for the benefit of His disciples and the apostles then, but for the benefit, encouragement and comfort of His true followers who would be on the earth at the time of the fulfilment of His prophetic words. It further proves that such faithful ones must be obedient to His commandments. These words of Jesus answering the question were prophetic. Until a prophecy is fulfilled or in course of fulfilment it cannot be understood. Today the prophecy of Jesus is fulfilled and we can understand it. God discloses by His prophet that the ‘Gentile times’ would continue for a period of 2520 years from and after the overthrow of King Zedekiah. That overthrow came to pass in 606 B.C. At all times since that date Satan has been the god of the Gentile -world. The end of the world would therefore moan the arriving of the time when Satan’s rule would be disputed by Christ, whose right it is to rule. That period of 2520 years ended in the fall of 1914. The facts show that there the prophecy of Jesus began to have fulfilment. It was at that time that the World War came, the like of which was never known in the history of man. Exactly in fulfilment of Jesus’ prophetic words nation rose against nation and kingdom against kingdom. During the war and even following after there were great famines and pestilences in many parts of the earth. Jesus said the coming to pass of these things would mark the beginning of sorrows, meaning thereby that His work of ousting Satan would begin at that time and that would be a beginning of the time of sorrow for those of Satan’s organization. In the context He shows that these sorrows and distresses would reach a ■ climax some time thereafter, and following that would come the blessings of the people. The fulfilment of this prophecy by the coming to pass of the events of the World War, famine, and pestilence, constituted the evidence of the interruption of Satan’s organization and power and the beginning of the reign of Christ; therefore it is proof conclusive of the end of Satan’s world and the presence of Christ. These facts constitute good news to all who have the desire for righteousness amongst the people on earth. This good news means “this gospel”, and the command of Jesus to His true followers is: ‘You must preach this gospel, or good news, to all the world as a witness unto the nations.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">■ 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Not Propaganda</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can it be properly said that “this gospel of the kingdom” and its proclamation is propaganda? Certainly not! The fact of the second, coming of Christ and of the setting up of His kingdom and of the ousting of Satan, and making these facts known, could not possibly be propaganda or propagandism. Any organization for the spreading of any particular system of thought or teaching, belief or practice, is propaganda. Following the practice of thus propagating such a system of thought or belief is propagandism. There are many organizations on earth called churches to which these definitions properly apply, because of their practice in furthering their own peculiar teachings or thought to induce others to join with them. Not so with “this gospel” which Jesus commanded must be preached. The Lord is not attempting to induce any one to join any organization or to believe the teachings of any organization. It would be impossible for those who are acting as witnesses for the Lord to be propagandists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What, then, is the purpose of preaching this gospel? The answer is, In order that the people may receive notice that the great time of change from the oppressive rule under Satan to the righteous rule of Christ is at hand. If America were about to change from a republic to a kingdom and men were sent throughout the land to testify to the people concerning this fact, that would not be propagandism, but wmuld be merely giving information. The Lord will have the people and the rulers informed that He has set His King upon His throne, and that the great climax is at hand and that Satan should be ousted and God’s kingdom of righteousness put in operation. Those who preach “this gospel” have no right or authority to ask any one to join some organization. They are merely servers of notice that Jehovah is the only true God and His kingdom is at hand. Concerning such it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Let him that hath an ear to hear, hear.’ Any one who does not desire to hear does not have to. The Scriptures show that not many will hear and obey the Lord at this time. Regardless of the fact that God commands that notice must be served upon the rulers and the people, a comparatively small number will heed what is said. That notice or good news will be heard or received by all who desire to see the human race get life everlasting in eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Who Must Preach</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will everybody who claims to be a Christian preach “this gospel”? Who must preach “this gospel” of the kingdom? Not all who claim to be Christians will preach this gospel, by any means. The Scriptures point out that it is God’s anointed servants that will preach this gospel. It is written in Revelation 22:14: “Blessed are they that do his commandments.” And again, in verse seventeen: “And the spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God is that great Spirit here mentioned and from whom all power and authority proceeds, Jesus Christ is the express image of Jehovah, and the one clothed with the power to execute the authority and judgment of Jehovah. God and Christ command that the testimony must be given, and therefore they say, “Come.” All that hear and obey are told to say, “Come,” which really means ‘to be set or take their place on the side of Jehovah or to take their place on the side of Satan the enemy.’ Otherwise stated, it is a notice, that each one may take the step that he desires. God is serving notice that the climax is approaching. Therefore He commands His servants to say to all who are athirst, that is, all who desire the kingdom of righteousness, to come and take their stand on the right side. The great controversy now on and which will shortly reach its greatest climax, is between God and the Devil; and Jehovah is causing notice to be given to the world before He takes final action against the Devil and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who are earnest and zealous in preaching this gospel and who are devoted to God and to Christ are therefore members of the army of the Lord. If you have devoted yourself unto Jehovah God by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ and have been received, and brought forth by Jehovah as His son, it becomes your privilege and duty as a true follower of Christ Jesus to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. No man, no body of men, can say who shall preach “'this gospel of the kingdom” or who shall not. Each one must determine for himself, after coming to the knowledge of the truth, whether or not he is willing to preach the gospel in obedience to God’s commandments. Those who really love God and Christ Jesus will obey His commandments, as it is written : “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments ; and his commandments are not burdensome.”—1 John 5: 3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why must “this gospel” be preached? The answer is, Because the world has ended, God’s kingdom is at hand, and the Lord has given commandment to TIis followers that they must toll this good news to the nations of the earth as a witness. With them it is not merely an option, but a positive command, because the language thereof is, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” It must not be preached for the purpose of converting the world or inducing the peoples of the world to join something, but to inform them of Jehovah’s, purposes. By His prophet Jehovah says to His anointed ones: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God,” and all who will obey Jehovah will thus be His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Wkat Constitutes Preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How may “the gospel” be preached? The word “preach” literally means to proclaim tidings or news. “’Preach this gospel,” therefore, means to procla</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font8"> or make known the good news of the kingdom of God. To preach or proclaim means to make known by means of publication. When the president of the United States wishes to make known to the people some matter of importance, like a public holiday, he issues a proclamation and publishes the same through the public press and by other means. Preaching this gospel of the kingdom, therefore, must be done by whatsoever means are provided in the day in which w<sup>r</sup>e are living. One of the most effective ways of making known or publishing facts today is by preparing such facts in book form and putting these in the hands of the people that they -may thereby inform themselves. For this purpose in recent years millions of books have been published which contain the message of this gospel of the kingdom and a detailed discussion thereof. Placing these books containing “this gospel” message in the hands of the people-' is preaching “this gospel” in the most effective way that it can be preached. The' people are thereby enabled to sit quietly in their homes and read “the gospel” and compare it with the Bible texts and thereby prove to themselves whether or not the message is true. This method of preaching “the gospel” is for the good of the people because it shows them how and when the great God of the universe will relieve them of their sorrows and distress and bring to them everlasting peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To enable the people to inform themselves upon these vital truths men and women go from house to house' and. place in the hands of those who desire to know, one or more of such books containing “this gospel of the kingdom”. Books cannot bo manufactured and published without cost of money. Those who make and deliver them are not doing so for a monetary profit. Much of the money to get such message to the people is furnished by voluntary contribution. A small amount is taken for the books when delivered, which money is used to print and publish more books for the benefit of the people. The Lord has graciously permitted everyone who loves Him, therefore, to have some part in making known in some manner the good news of “this gospel” of the day of deliverance and that it is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Opposition, and Why</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If this gospel or good news is for the good of mankind, then why should there be so much opposition to it? The proper answer to that question throws a tremendous. light upon the present-day conditions. I wish that I might convince you that I am not fighting against men, be they clergymen or of any other profession. Addressing the followers of Christ Jesus, the. apostle said, in Philippians 1: 27: 'Stand shoulder to shoulder fighting for the gospel of the kingdom.’ </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Weymouth)</span><span class="font8"> That is exactly what the true followers of Christ are doing this day. That means that the Lord foreknew that there would be some who would fight against the gospel and some who through adverse conditions would be faithful witnesses to the Lord. The Scriptures disclose that such opposition proceeds from Satan the Devil. If the people all knew of “this gospel of the kingdom” and that it is for their good there would be no opposition to it. They wmuld gladly receive it. In 2 Corinthians 4: 3,4 it is written: Tf this gospel [or good news] be hid, it is hid from those by Satan, the god of this world, who blinds them to the truth.’ For many centuries Satan has been reproaching God and turning the people away from Him. Jehovah could have prevented this, but He has let Satan go on unhindered until His own due time to take action against him. That time has now come. But before Jehovah takes final and effective action against Satan He will have the people informed concerning the matter. The Scriptures conclusively prove, and the facts support that proof, that Satan is putting forth every power he possesses to deceive the people and turn them away from the truth. He wars against those who are striving to tell the truth. In Revelation 12:17 it is written that the Dragon, Satan, goes forth to make war with those who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Whoever, therefore, opposes the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom” is being used of Satan, whether he knows it or not. Often a person, ignorant or blind to the truth, does that which he would not do if he knew the truth. Satan induces all whom he can to fight against the witness of Jehovah in order to prevent the people from knowing the truth. He causes fanatical religionists to importune the law officers to apprehend and bring into court those who humbly strive to carry out God’s commandments. God is supreme and, He having commanded that “this gospel” must be preached, the true followers' of Christ now must say as did Paul and Peter: ‘We must obey God rather than men’; and that is why they go on preaching it regardless of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But why should the clergymen of the various churches, who claim themselves to be preachers, oppose those who are preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”? In answer to that question I quote the words of Romans 6:16: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?” The people must determine from the facts and the Scriptures whether or not these men, who claim to be preachers and who are opposing this gospel of the kingdom, are the servants of Jehovah or the servants of Satan the god of this world. If they are not in the service of Jehovah, then their advice should not be heeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The makers of the Constitution of the United States deemed it important that every man should have the privilege of practicing his faith in God as he might choose, and therefore wrote into the Constitution this provision:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have reached “the end of the world” and are therefore now in “the last days” described in the Scriptures. Concerning that time it is written, in 2 Timothy 3:1,2: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. Foi’ men shall be lovers of their own selves, . . . having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” This is clearly borne out by the facts. The Eighteenth Amendment was enacted and is enforced upon the theory that it will bring about morality amongst the people. Those who have to do with its enforcement say: “We must enforce this because it is the law.” If the Eighteenth Amendment should be enforced merely because it is the law, with stronger reasoning should the First Amendment be enforced, because it is the law both of man and of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Upon a false pretext of righteousness the Eighteenth Amendment takes away the liberties of the people, whereas the First Amendment is a guarantee that every man shall have full liberty to worship God and preach the gospel -without let or hindrance. The ultra-fanatical religionists or church men would enforce the Eighteenth Amendment with shotguns and thereby violate the law of God which says: “Thou shalt not kill.” The same class of fanatical religionists would push aside and render null and void the First Amendment of the Constitution, and thereby violate the law of man and specifically violate the law of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">which says : &quot;This gospel'of the kingdom shall he preached.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the Washington </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font8"> published recently, these fanatical religionists are responsible for the untimely deaths of 1,360 men, women and children. These were killed with guns, upon the pretext that such was necessary in order to enforce the prohibition law. At the same time these same fanatics would put in jail men and women who obey God by telling the people the truth.- Upon the face of all the facts it is manifest that the Devil himself is the one who opposes the preaching of &quot;this gospel of the kingdom” because to do so is obeying God’s commandments. It is also quite clear that Satan the Devil is responsible for the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Satan is now in control of the majority of the clergymen in the churches, and by hypocritically taking the apparent high moral standard of cleaning up the world from the liquor traffic, he hopes to get the order-loving people into the church systems and thereby turn them away from a knowledge of God and His purposes. The order-loving people desire to see a clean and orderly condition prevail amongst men. They are entitled to learn the truth as to how this can be accomplished. It must be clear to all that shotguns and jails will never reform lawbreakers nor bring about morality. How then can purity, righteousness and peace be established in the earth? God’s Word, the Bible, plainly states how God will bring about this desirable condition. The purpose of preaching this gospel of His kingdom is to inform mankind how God will destroy wickedness and bring about righteousness and how in the administration of His righteous government He will lift the burdens of oppression from the backs of the people, cleanse the world of all filthiness and crime, and establish in the land everlasting peace, prosperity, life and happiness. Such information is of vital -importance to all mankind. For that reason the use of the radio to broadcast the truth concerning the kingdom of God is of greatest public interest, public convenience and public necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah G-od is all-powerful. What He has purposed, He will bring to pass; and no amount of opposition can prevent Him from accomplishing His purposes. For this reason His faithful witnesses fear neither man nor the Devil but will fearlessly continue to preach &quot;this gospel of the kingdom” as long as Jehovah so directs. Satan and his agencies will continue to oppose but will never stop the promulgation of the truth henceforth. This is the time in which “this gospel of the kingdom [must] be preached”. In 1918 the World War suddenly ceased, and the real reason therefor was that this witness work to Jehovah’s name might be done. The period of comparative peace from then till now was brought about by the Lord to enable His faithful witnesses to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom to the nations of the world as witnesses. There will be a time 'when the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom” will cease; but it will cease only in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What then shall follow the conclusion of the preaching of &quot;this gospel of the kingdom”? In answer to that question Jesus said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached, . . . and then shall the end come.” What Jesus meant by these words is fully explained in other texts of the Bible. According to the Scriptures, that will mark the greatest crisis of the ages. Every nation on earth will be involved, and therefore information concerning the same is of vital interest to all peoples. It will be my privilege next Sunday, by the Lord’s grace, to give the Scriptural reasons and proof concerning the greatest crisis of the ages.</span></p>

W., Jr, </span><span class="font10">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story Fifty-one</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font8">OW Pilate was loathe to deliver Jesus up to the Jews; but when they told him that by not doing so he would become a traitor to Ctesar, Pilate in desperation washed his hands of the case and resigned the gentle Son of God to the will of the hard-hearted and ungrateful people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people, incited by the high priests and Pharisees, completely forgot the blessings and miracles which Jesus had lavishly worked in their midst; the blind He had restored to sight, the lame He had made to walk; the dead He had given life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These foolish, easily influenced, wayward people clamored for the death of Jesus. When Pilate caused Jesus to be brought upon the platform of the palace, after the Roman soldiers had given the Master a hard scourging and had pressed upon His beautiful brow an ugly crown of thorns, these people set up a great shout, “Away with him, away with him! Crucify him!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of what followed immediately after, we need not go over with much detail, for the story of Jesus’ crucifixion is familiar to all. We will pass over that event, the last and greatest in the earthly life of the Son of God, merely pausing to remark His devotion to Mary, His mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When He was on the cross, and within a few moments of death, He spoke to one of His disciples, who stood at the foot of the cross, and directed him to take His mother home, and give her shelter with his own family. This the disciple did, most gladly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At this point it will be well for us to recall the reason for Jesus’ ministry on earth. Father Adam, four thousand years before, had brought condemnation to death upon himself. This was because of his disobedience to the command of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was God’s purpose to have man live upon the earth for ever; so we see that if Adam had not disobeyed God, he and his children would be alive today. But Adam sinned, and lost the right to life. Through him all his children also have lost this right. God did not break His part of the contract with Adam; and He was ready to carry out His purpose of everlasting life for all mankind, by providing-an equal price to ransom or redeem the life that Adam lost through. wilMn.es s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adam was a perfect man, but his children have all been imperfect because of his sin. So a child of Adam could not provide the ransom price. Jesus, the Logos, the Word, the One whom Jehovah directed in creating all things in the universe, took upon Himself the life of a perfect man, and was born, reared, and died a perfect man, willingly giving His perfect life as the only equal price that could be found in the universe to redeem the life lost by Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But if Jesus had stayed dead unto this day, He could not Himself have presented that price to God in heaven. Or, if Jesus, dying a perfect human being, had been raised from the dead a perfect human being, the price would not have been paid. So this is the beautiful, joyful truth of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus, before He came to earth, had been a spirit being. He </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">became,</span><span class="font8"> for our sakes, a perfect human being, born of a woman as all human beings are born. He lived upon the earth, teaching and preaching the Word of God, working miracles by the holy spirit, and gathering follow<sup>T</sup>ers to preach the Word to all the world after His death. He died upon the cross a perfect human being, with a physical, human body, at thirty-three years of age, in the prime of His manhood. Upon the third day after His death He was raised from the dead (resurrected by the power of God), and appeared first to Mary Magdalene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We say </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">appeared,</span><span class="font8"> for this is the fact we wish to make clear before your minds: Jesus had laid down His perfect </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">human</span><span class="font8"> life, upon the cross, thereby paying the ransom and insuring all mankind an equal chance for eternal life. Upon His resurrection, however, He again took up spiritual life, a life similar but superior to the life He had before He came to earth, and indeed before the earth was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So when, three days after His death, He appeared to Mary Magdalene, we know He was in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font8"> nature, but He gave Himself a visible human shape to be seen by her; He was and is a spirit, and will be such for ever and for ever, because the Son of man has been raised even above the high estate that once was His, before His earthly pilgrimage, exalted far above the angels in spirit qualities of power, eternal life, and invisibility, and is now divine.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><sup><a name="bookmark42"></a>64</sup>We Believe in Immortality”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font8">OME one sent us a book bearing the above title in which are brought together the affirmations of one hundred prominent men and women as to why they believe they already have immortality. We glanced through the book, just to see the Scriptural evidence upon which the book was based, and were amused to find just what should have been expected, that from cover to cover there was not a single Scriptural citation, yet many of these men are certainly of the clergy. We recognize scores of them as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. There were a few, a very few, Scripture quotations ; but not a citation, not one. Of the quotations most were references to Jesus’ resurrection. The compiler seemed not to have discerned that resurrection and immortality are two entirely different things. Immortality is “undieableness”, a condition in which death is an impossibility. A resurrection of the dead teaches the opposite, namely, that one who: has been dead is no longer dead, but awakened out of death. If immortal, he would not need to be awakened. He would be awake all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of the remaining quotations practically all were misapplied scriptures, some of them having no relation whatever to the subject under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How much better the Bible puts it all, that the dead are dead until the resurrection; that God “only hath immortality” (1 Tim. 6:16); that there are some living who “by patient continuance in well doing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">seek</span><span class="font8"> for glory and honour and immortality” (Rom. 2:6,7), knowing full w<sup>T</sup>ell that they will never get it unless they do seek it; and that of these, eventually some “must </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">put on</span><span class="font8"> immortality”.—1 Cor. 15: 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course the most elementary reasoning would show these theologians that they could not possibly put on immortality if they already had it on. When a thing is on, it’s on; and when it is off, it is off. The trouble with the theology of the book is that it is trying to fool itself into believing that a thing that is off is on and that therefore there is no sense at all in trying to put it on. The book is “off”, but most of our readers are “on”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">IIS is a period of nine days, beginning April 26, ending May 4, during which time thousands of Christian people ail over the world will engage in distributing the message of God’s kingdom soon to be established on earth. They will call at the homes, at places of business, at offices, at factories, during the noon hour, in fact anywhere where people can be found, with one of the most remarkable offers ever made. They will offer the seven clothbound books written by Judge Rutherford, for $2.40, and nine 64-page booklets for 50c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No doubt most readers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> already have these &quot;books in their libraines, but it may be that some will desire to have a part in this great witness work that will take place IB SA IV eek. Here’s how we suggest they do it: On the morning of April 27, the first Sunday of IB SA Week, Judge Rutherford will broadcast over two separate chains, one covering the East and another the West. Probably many of your friends will be listening in to this broadcast. If you have gotten pleasure and comfort from reading Judge Rutherford’s remarkable explanations of the Bible, why not during that week call on some of your friends who have listened in and tell them about these books, and the good things that you have read, and offer them a set of the seven elothbound books for $2.40, or maybe the nine booklets for 50c, or tell them to write us ? We can give you assurance that anyone engaging in this work will receive much pleasure and joy, because they are having a part in honoring the name of Jehovah, the only true God, who never fails to reward. We know many readers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font9">who are going to do&gt; this, and we feel like suggesting it to all. If you feel so disposed, write soon for supply of books and booklets.</span></p>

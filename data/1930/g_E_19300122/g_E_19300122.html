Y., Wednesday, January 2.2, 1S30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 270</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A Little Bit About Homes</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">S LONG- as we have human beings on the earth they will be interested in homes, though the home of the future will probably be quite different from the one to which we are accustomed today. Indeed, the old-style individual home is passing away before our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War, with all the bricklayers, masons, carpenters, plumbers, etc., engaged for four years in killing other bricklayers, masons, carpenters and plumbers, left a great shortage of homes. The Avar brides had war babies and had to live in with the old folks until room could be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As soon as the Avar was over, great efforts were made to correct the situation, the building mechanics who Avere spared returned to their usual labors, tremendous strides Avere made in the adaptation of machinery to the work of building, and shortages are already mostly a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Avar England has rehoused a tenth of her population, and Holland about one-fifth of hers. Philadelphia claims to be tAVO years overbuilt. Berlin, at last accounts, was still short in homes for her people. London has erected ten thousand houses a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The British Viscountess Byng of Vimy has been building four-room cottages at $750 each, and renting them at a profit of $1.10 a week. New York has had many ambitious rehousing Avorks under Avay, especially the Lavanburg model tenements, which rent at $6 a month per room. It will surprise some of our readers to know that New York hoav claims to have better housing for its workers as a Avhole than any other city in the world. Yet Avith all this it has some areas that can only be viewed with shame and regret. Ncav Zealand housing conditions are very superior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England, Holland, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and Norway the federal and municipal governments have not hesitated to courageously tackle the problems of housingdesign and housing shortage, and to solve the problems involved. After all, what greater good can a government accomplish than to help everybody into a comfortable and sanitary home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Drift to Apartments</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A survey of NeAV York building permits shoAVS that the general drift of neAV construction is away from the individual home and toward the apartment, away from all-frame types to nonframe types. This is generally true also, though there are still many new individual homes being built in Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. The strongholds of apartment houses are Boston, New York, Chicago and San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day of the skyscraper apartment house may now be said to have arrived. New Yorkers like to live near their work. They can not be blamed for that. Hence it is no surprise to learn that $50,000,000 worth of residential skyscrapers will be built forthAvith in doAvntoAvn New York, within a feAV blocks of the heart of the financial district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A realty company in Chicago is planning a skyscraper apartment in the middle of a fiftyacre suburban tract. This elaborate plan calls for collective ownership of apartments, golf course, tennis courts, bridle path, swimming pool, recreation fields, drug store, delicatessen, barber shop, beauty parlor, medical and dental offices, a city in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Noav York has carried the reduction of space for an apartment to what would seem to be the last extreme. One room answers all purposes. Corner alcoves and cupboards house all that the home contains. Only an occasional meal is eaten at home, and that can be bought at a delicatessen, cooked and ready to serve, or may be cooked in a central kitchen in the building itself, for a small sum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only porch that many New Yorkers know anything about is the fire escape. With a board across the opening, and possibly a quilt spread over, the board, the little folks play safely far up above the street levels. Company must not come to many New York homes. If they do come they will have to go to a hotel. The sick must go to a hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of late years many New Yorkers, accustomed to city life in the winter, and preferring it, have small homes in the suburbs in which they live during the pleasant summer months. The newer apartment houses are equipped with wireless aerials, lead-ins and grounding switches, with the conviction that radio is here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Good and Bad Landlords</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Landlords are only a temporary expedient. The Scripture statement, “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,” with none to molest or make him afraid, puts the landlord out of the picture; but he is in it now, nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The good landlord is Matt. M. Dinan, of South Bend, Indiana. When a tenant has paid him rent for twenty-one years the tenant gets a paid-up lease on the house he occupies, the lease to run until the tenant dies, or until he moves out of his own accord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another good landlord, almost too good, some would say, is the city of Vienna, -which has virtually taken possession of all the rentable property in the city, and rents it out for what it thinks the renters can afford to pay, and that is next to nothing; the landlords are not getting anything out of their properties except the privilege of paying the taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Russia rooms are rented by the yard and paid for on the basis of the tenant’s weekly wage. In Genoa, Italy, in the properties of Alessandro Ganasso, any family that has a new arrival in the family gets one month’s free rent for each child born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming to the other side of the landlord matter we hear of districts in England in which it is a common practice for landlords to charge extra rent for houses on the sunny side of the street, on the theory that less fuel is needed to heat the house. The extra rent is supposed to equalize the tenants’ saving in fuel bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably he can afford to pay it, but the tenant who occupies the three top floors of the new thirty-two story Hotel Delmonico, at Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth street, New York city, pays $45,000 a year for the privilege. The rental of another . Park Avenue apartment is $36,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A New York landlord insists that all his tenants must be vegetarians like himself. He can not bear the odor of cooking meat. His properties stand empty most of the time. The top floors of walk-up apartments in New York are no longer popular. Elevators are in common use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New York landlords of apartment houses are required to furnish 68 degrees of heat between six o’clock in the morning and ten o’clock at night, whenever the temperature on the street is 55 degrees or lower. This rule of the City Board of Health is of only recent enactment. The need of such a rule has been evident for years.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moving Day and Movers .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once a year Chicago sees almost one-half of its population move, and New York is not far behind. October 1 is the day when the great exodus takes place, and all efforts of the real estate men to distribute the burden over other dates seem in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The moving day is chaos all over the city. Moving men charge double the rates asked on other days. Workers for the various public service companies have to work sixteen to twenty hours to make the various connections demanded. Family life for the day is wrecked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thore is another great class of movers in New York: the homeless men that are ever on the go and yet have no place to which they can go. The number of these men has been increasing steadily for the last ten years. As fewer and fewer men are required in manufacturing, owing to the great increase in industrial efficiency, more and more men become destitute and are deprived of the privilege of making a home or even living in one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An odd feature about moving is that many of the families that move out of certain quarters, looking for better accommodations, or better landlords, or what not, find themselves less suited in the new locations than in the old ones and, after a year away, move back into their old quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The annual moving bill is set at about $107,000,000 for the 7,000,000 people who move. The landlords are supposed to be set back $15,000,-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">000 for alterations, $30,000,000 goes to the moving companies, $65,000,000 for new furniture, and $12,000,000 goes to plumbers, carpenters, painters, laundrymen, charwomen and others who have a hand in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As to Building a Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The safety of every large fortune in the country depends upon the number of people who are permitted to own their own homes, yet it seems sometimes as if the present possessors of those fortunes are trying to see how few people may have that privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It takes money to build homes and equip them, and that means that good wages must be paid, and opportunities be afforded to participate in the profits of the nation’s business. Some years ago 54.4 percent of the homes of the United States were rented, and only 28.2 percent were owned by their occupants, free of incumbrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The principal items of expense in home building are set at 36 percent for the foundation, 29 percent for carpentry, 10 percent for plumbing, 9 percent for heating, 8 percent for hardware, 6 percent for painting and 2 percent for lighting. For an average brick structure, out of each dollar of the total cost 26% cents goes to labor. Bungalows, sold in South Brooklyn for $5,600 to $5,800 each, cost 57 percent of that amount, the remaining- 43 percent going for promotion and financing. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">America has still some distance to go before the blessings of this civilization will be uniformly distributed. Thousands of homes, even in supposedly progressive cities, are still without running water in the kitchen sinks. At least onefourth of the housekeepers in Atlanta, Ga., Wilmington, Del., New Haven, Conn., and Springfield, Mass., still fill and clean kerosene lamps. The Power Trust could change this if it would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gambling orgy in New York has made it hard for some builders and home owners. The funds that should have been kept at home for legitimate development of the community, and at a modest rate of interest, were sent to New York to engage in the highest form of gambling known to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Poor as conditions are in spots in the United States, they are nothing as compared with European conditions. In a Budapest (Hungary) paper, not long ago, an advertisement appeared, “Half a bed to let by decent family: inspection invited.” An investigation showed that the entire bed was for rent, but on a half-time basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Old Homes and New</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germany has a house at Winkel, in the Rhine district, that is known to be eleven centuries old. The rooms on the ground floor are a little below the ground, and divided by a full-length wall. Light comes through small slits in the outside walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The oldest residence in Great Britain is Dun-vegan Castle, in the Isle of Skye. Part of it dates from the ninth century, or two hundred years before the Norman conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At East Tibury, England, there are remains of huts at least a thousand years old. These huts, all circular in shape, vary in diameter from eleven and one-half to twenty feet. The poet Chaucer described these early dwellings as Teapot hall, all roof, no wall’; and the description could hardly be improved upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Whitfield mansion, at Guilford, Conn., built in 1639, is still in use. Built of stone only nineteen years after the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth, it has walls two feet thick, with a main chimney sixteen feet across. As the house was originally built, a team of horses drove through the front door and out the rear, dragging huge logs behind them which, when in position, were rolled into the fire with crowbars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old-fashioned grate was the cheeriest kind of a fire, though not an economical heating arrangement. Nevertheless, it would be fine if every home could have a good usable fireplace. There are times when nothing, else in the home can be as attractive as an open fire in the grate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New York state has plenty of farmhouses over two hundred years old that are still in constant use. They are roomy, w<sup>T</sup>arm, and comfortable,' and built by men who knew how to build well. There are still many old and beautiful homes in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Virginia and other of the eastern seaboard states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Clark’s Green, near Scranton, Pa., there is a fine old mansion which contains a bedroom that can be reached only through the ceiling by taking up the loose floor boards of the attic floor. This home was, one of the “underground” stations of slavery days in which runaway slaves were kept during the day time. At night they were spirited on their way to Canada and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn the newer single homes now being built in the vicinity of New York more attention is being paid to closets than ever before. There are plenty of them that house disappearing beds and other articles of furniture that are used only at dressing time. One woman told her builder that her closet must have room for 200 pairs of shoes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Decay and Repair &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dry wood does not decay, and a house that has been properly built will be dry. Decay in wood is caused by low forms of plant life, fungi, which destroy wood for their food; but the fungi themselves must have moisture in order to live. The reason that roofs and porches decay first is that they are most exposed to moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a great deal of building done by men who take no pride in their work, and who put in lumber that has not been properly seasoned, and make no provision for its ventilation, nor even for it ever to get fully dry. It is no wonder that such houses are badly in need of repairs in twelve years, and can not be expected to last over fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The British Isles still have many thatched roofs. Reeds are plentiful, and the danger from fires is not so great as it would be in America’s drier climate. A thatched roof is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than any other kind of roofing. A good thatched roof is . over a foot thick and in the wettest kind of weather does not get wet more than an inch down from the top. The high winds that we have in America make thatched roofs impracticable here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old-style shingle, an inch thick at the butt and half an inch thick at the thin edge, was a good roof cover, but such shingles can be had no more. The modern ones are hardly three-eighths of an inch thick at the butt, and are almost paper thickness at the thin edge. They have killed themselves, and asphalt shingles are taking their place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Steel construction is coming, slowly but surely. The steel men insist that a house with a steel frame is indestructible; will not shrink, warp, swell or rot; will not harbor vermin; can be insulated against heat, cold or sound, and can be made lightning-proof, tornado-proof and earthquake-proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Odd Types of Houses &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mud houses ought not to be as rare as they are. Every building lot has the material, if mixed with straw and properly molded, for a good house right on the lot where it is to be built. A subscriber for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> has expended a fortune in trying to interest his fellow men in this inexpensive building material, lying all about us, but all to no purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the eastern end of Lake Ontario, on Amherst Island, there is a mud house over 100 years old. The walls are eleven feet high and four feet thick, molded in one piece. They were evidently built in a form. The clay, mixed with straw, was tamped into place with saplings imbedded about six inches apart. Originally, the outside of the house was plastered, but it is now protected by clapboards. Otherwise no changes have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many sod houses still in use in western Kansas, eastern Colorado, northern Texas and western Oklahoma. The early settlers were far from sources of lumber, so they erected their homes from the virgin sod, cutting and piling it after the fashion of the modern cement blocks. These houses are cool in summer and warm in winter, but not too beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dugout dwellings are the only kind that soldiers in the front-line trenches know. It is a case of dig or be killed. The best digger stands the best chance of surviving the terrible onslaughts of his fellow “Christians”. Let us hope that the poor' heathen never get converted, at least not to the machine-gun poison-gas type of Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two ex-soldiers in San Francisco made a hit recently. They squatted on a $100,000 building lot in the heart of the city, and as they had no home and little money they built themselves a dugout after the manner of 1914-1918, charged admission, and now have a flower garden, beautiful shrubbery, radio, telephone service and all the comforts of home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Concrete and Steel Homes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concrete homes, or steel homes, or homes which are part concrete and part steel are sure to be more widely built, with the passing years. Large numbers of steel homes have been built in the British Isles. One of them was erected in three hours in Europe recently, to demonstrate what can be done. A can of standard-size bolts is all that is needed to put the house together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germany has a firm which makes at its factory complete houses ready for tenancy. They can be put up in two days. The side walls are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Tfce </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of cement slabs ten feet square. Floors and roofs are of the same material. Doors and windows are cast in special sections, and can be placed as desired. The builder casts his piers in the ground, lays light iron beams upon them, and upon these beams erects his cement structure. After fastening all the sections firmly together he calks up the cracks with fresh cement, which hardens in a few hours, and the house is done. It seems to us that this is a sensible way to build inexpensive, durable homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hollywood, California, has a rectangular house with massive concrete walls on the outside, and no outside windows. The rooms are arranged about an interior court and receive light through glass ceilings. This would not appeal to us. It is too much like a convent or monastery or jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Berlin a gigantic water tower of solid brick construction 'was transformed into an apartment house accommodating 100 persons. French architects have designed an octagonal house of seven rooms and bath which is mounted on a turntable, so that any of its eight sides may be srvung to face the sun or the breeze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Detroit has a $50,000 house which is reserved exclusively for guests of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick M. Alger, whenever they have a house party. At Jamaica Bay a fisherman has his family in a dwelling wdiich is perched on piles above the ever-changing tides. Such homes were once very common in Europe, and are still to be found in parts of France and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unhomelike Homes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most unhomelike home in the world is probably the home at 43d St. and Broadway, New York, in the basement. For fifty cents a month you may register as a guest and receive your mail or other communications. You may ■write letters and send telephone or telegraph messages at standard rates. A locker may be rented by the day, week, month or year. A razor can be rented for ten cents, or an umbrella for a small sum. You can get your shoes shined or* repaired, or your suit pressed. There is a barber shop, news stand, drug store, theatrical ticket office, and haberdashery. But if you wish to stay over night you must go somewhere else!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1859 somebody wrote that “The home is fast disappearing. Our young ladies have no longer the ideals of their mothers”. Sounds as if it 'were, written seventy years later. Now many American homes are merely places to sleep. One-sixth of the marriages are failures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Between 1900 and 1920 the number of restaurants increased four times as fast as the number of families. Between 1914 and 1925 bakery production increased four times as fast as the number of families. Between 1910 and 1920 the number of delicatessens grew three times as fast as the population. These figures show that mother is doing something besides cooking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London has 250,000 basement rooms. This cellar city is next to the Thames and within a stone’s throw of Westminster Abbey and the houses of Parliament. In high water the residents of these cellar rooms are liable to drown, and many of them have so drowned. In any ■weather the poor inhabitants fade and die from ■want of air and light; but they are too poor to move elsewhere, and these apartments are always cro-wded. Brooklyn has many apartments below the street level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Housekeeping in Borneo has its disadvantages. Eight or ten or even a hundred families live in a single community house. The houses are constructed on piles, with ladders leading to the outer uncovered veranda, which runs the entire length of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Philippines the native huts are exceedingly diminutive in size, and when the children grow to be any size they are placed in community homes. Trial marriage is a Philippine custom, lately adopted, in modified form, in the United States. Particulars can be had at Hollywood and Reno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A young couple in Breslau, Germany, ejected from their home by a court order, moved their worldly effects to the city hall steps, chalked off their Tooms’ and prepared to camp out. This produced the desired results, and new quarters were found for them forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kiddie Proposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What is home 'without a mother?” has its natural corollary in “What is home without a bunch of kiddies?” If -what people want is rest and quiet and peace, then the cemetery is always handy; but until we get there we must expect to mingle -with live ones, and the kiddies are the livest things there are in the 'world today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The kids are always interesting from 0 to 100. By that time they are in their second childhood, and interesting all over again. There is no telling what a human being will do or say under stress; and that is what makes living such an exciting pastime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An eleven-year-old youngster startled his Sunday school teacher by saying, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am tired of this Jesus business. Let’s have a livelier kind of stories.” Another one of these modern productions that needed guidance made the startling remark: “I’ve discovered Dad is Santa Claus, and the stork, and now I’m going to look into this Jesus Christ affair.” It is to such children that the future must look for its men and women. Shall they be told the truth, or will the old Santa Claus, hell fire, trinity and immortality lies be ladled out to them as heretofore? In any event, it may be set down as certain that they will not accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Children are still appreciated in most homes. Many adults unwilling to have children of their own are 'willing to adopt those of others. The Child-Placing Department of the New York State Charities Aid Association reports in recent years a great increase in the supply of foster-parents. The preference for adoption runs to girls, and especially to infants. It is hard to find homes for boys over six years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While some girls are paying more attention than ever before to learning how to care for a home, with all its problems of cooking, sewing, mending, rearing children, nursing, and trimming the household budget to fit a small income, yet not all girls are that way inclined. When a real estate agent made the suggestion to one girl that she should buy a home and settle down she is alleged to have made the reply: “What do I need of a home ? I was born in a hospital, educated in a college, courted in an auto and married in a church: I live out of the delicatessen and paper bags: I spend my mornings on the golf course, my afternoons at the bridge table, and my evenings at the movies. When I die I am going to be buried at the undertakers. All I need is a garage.”</span></p>

Somehow there did not seem to be any Scripture citations in the report which we saw of the talk.

A preacher helped some by putting 100 of the workers out of his church. They did not know it at the time, but this was one of the best things that ever happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Gastonia Solicitor</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">T IS claimed that the Gastonia solicitor who successfully pleaded for the conviction of the seven labor leaders rolled on the floor, shouted, knelt in “prayer”, denounced the defendants as “foreign communists” and “devils with hoofs and horns” and screamed at the jury, demanding, “Do you believe in the flag? Do you believe in North Carolina?” All we have to say is that if that is what it means to believe in the flag and believe in North Carolina every man in the box should^ have jumped to his feet and shouted </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“NO”</span><span class="font6"> in tones that would have raised the roof. To send seven men to prison for five to twenty years after that kind of court-room farce is a disgrace to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ministers on the Pay Rolls</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font6">HEN one hundred members of the Baptist church at East Marion, N. C., were dropped from the membership because they wanted decent hours of work and decent wages, and had gone on strike to get them, it was discovered that the pastor of the church, and the deacons too, were on the pay roll of the mills. And now thou knowest what the pastor in a mill town is for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Treason, Rebellion, and Conspiracy </span><span class="font6">THE six unarmed workers at Marion, N. C,, -S- who on October 1 -were shot in the back and killed are still dead, and the sheriff has been exonerated. Of the workers not shot in the back, and still living, five have been arrested and are being tried for treason, rebellion, and conspiracy. The industries of Marion consist of two mills, the employees average to work 67% hours a week for a wage of $11. These wages are only two-thirds the wages paid in Massachusetts. It seems to be treason in North Carolina to want better wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dollars Make All Da Alike</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A COMMISSION of the Georgia Baptist Convention, assembled at Gainesville, Ga., has made the following resolution: “A few years ago we Southerners were bitterly denouncing New England cotton mills for the way they treated their labor. Now that some of these mills are coming South, we find some of our Southern statesmen angrily defending these same practices in the South. Then they denounced high protective tariff of New England industries: now they are clamoring for that same protection for Southern mills. Surely dollars make us all do alike.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Gastonia Grand Jury</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fPHE same grand jury which indicted the strike leaders at Gastonia for defending themselves from attack by a mob, which indictment has resulted in the conviction of seven of them for murder, flatly refused to indict any of the nine men, composed of bosses and employees of textile mills, who shot and killed Ella May Wiggins, and also refused to indict any members of the mob charged with kidnaping three union organizers. This grand jury is doing all in its power to wreck America, and deserves to be indicted itself.</span></p>

The balance is used for profit, for office expenses, and for swinging the stock market this way or that, as the big financiers find convenient.</span></p>

In the evenings every one looks forward to the approaching hours of unconsciousness. Insomnia is considered an unsurpassed evil.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">An Elephant’s Prodigious Memory</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> SUBSCRIBER writes us that in his neighboring city of Corsicana, Texas, an elephant suddenly dashed from the ranks in which he was parading through the streets with the rest of the herd, rushed to the sidewalk, seized a woman in his trunk and whipped her to death before he could be checked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It transpired, subsequently that it was this same woman, who, seven years before, had given employment to the elephant’s keeper, and thus had been a means of separating the two. After he had agreed to a change of employers, and when he came to hid the elephant good bye, the woman was along. The elephant remembered her, identified the city, saw her in the crowd, and murdered her for taking his keeper away from. him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When an elephant goes bad it is customary to kill it; the death sentence was passed upon Black Diamond. Three elephants led him forth from his car in chains, and he seemed instinctively to know that he was to be executed, for he refused food offered to him, which food contained poisons, and went to his death hungry. He was chained to two trees, meantime trumpeting shrilly. Several volleys from machine guns were needed to end his career. The carcass weighed nine tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gravy a la Cenotaph. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Ida Herron</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">H</span><span class="font6">AVING been so greatly helped by your articles on aluminum poison, I 'wish to tell my experience, in the hope that it will be of help to some one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time I first paid much attention to your article on aluminum poison I was having an awful time with my legs. They were almost twice their normal size, and the pain and cramps in them would awaken me almost every morning around 3: 30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About four months ago I quit using my aluminum dishes for cooking, or even to let cold food stand in them; and though my ankles are not quite normal, yet they are very much better. My eyes do not have the yellow look they had; and I am stronger, and rest well at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some might say, <sup>c</sup>Oh, you are off your feet more,’ or something like that; but that is not so, as I have had a busy time with the regular weekly drives for the books, and housecleaning and general farm work has been one continual round of walking and hard work; but I am so much stronger, and thankful to be able to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I don’t even use an ahmiinum cover on a dish while boiling. I had a real bad time for almost three days as a result of using my only aluminum cover two Aveeks ago when cooking porridge. Even after the first day, when the worst of the vomiting ceased, I had awful pains for the next two days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am positive it was nothing else but the steam from the lid dropping all the time. I had felt so fine before breakfast that morning that I remember hoping our service director would give me lots to do; and then before noon they had to rush me home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have thought since how we often used to remark that fresh roast of either beef or pork had no ill effects until two or three days later. And I had a little aluminum dish I usually used to keep my left-over gravy in, as we were always told they were so safe. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ .</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Uplift—</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">LIGHT tremors, with the greatest monetary shock ever recorded in the history of Wall Street, struck that famous financial center during the last week of October and shook some of the excessive froth from financial and speculating pocketbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only were small investors slaughtered, but so rapid and violent was the fall of prices that many, if not all, of the oldest and most experienced brokers and speculators had to sit tight and watch their holdings suffer severe losses because of the falling avalanche.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Stockholders who did not speculate on margin, but who had bought their stocks outright, saw their peak prices melt in most instances to less than half through the scared selling by minority shareholders. A certain auto company’s shares, for instance, sold for $514 a share on September 18. On October 29 those shares brought only $120 on the market; a loss of approximately 77 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So unsound and unjust is the manipulation, and policy of this financial machine that a minority of shareholders or speculators can, by frantically selling their small lots of shares for what they will bring, establish on the stock exchange prices which affect the balance or majority of shares, and which may total into the hundreds of millions. Ridiculous? Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that many of these high peaks or prices were affected by the same small minority, or manipulated by pools of speculators to a price out of all proportion to the investment and earnings of the companies invo</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nevertheless, those peak prices represented money, and even though termed 'paper profits’ they were redeemable in cash to those selling their stocks at these high prices. And even though they were speculative profits, they had to be paid for out of the productive labor of the people. For where all contribute in labor to the wealth of the community or country, that wealth, by manipulation into the hands of the few, can not but affect each and every contributor comprising a part of society.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">There are a few features involved in this .latest financial crash which are worthy of note. During the first shock on T li u r s day, October . 24, when almost 13,000,000 shares were dumped on the market, with net losses estimated at approximately $5,000,000,000, a conference of famous bankers was held in Wall Street’s largest financial institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Assurances were made that the banking interests would support the falling market. The secretary of the treasury in Washington conferred with the Federal Reserve Bank, also with President Hoover; and one and all took particular pains to assert their faith in the sound financial security of the country, that there was nothing to fear, that the business structure of the country ivas running smoothly and soundly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of such assurances, the following Monday found stocks continuing their downward rush, until Tuesday completely crashed the bottom out of the market with an avalanche of over 16,000,000 shares1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conferences still continued; statements were still issued, for what they were worth; but nothing could stop the debacle. So much for assurances 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now it has always been, and still is the policy of the moneyed class, that is, those with an aptitude for financial profit, to buy low, and sell high. Your shrewd local trader will buy cows cheap in the fall, when necessity compels many</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">So </span><span class="font5">with </span><span class="font6">financial king</span><span class="font5">pins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W h e n s t o c k s ha d reached such a low level that the carefully observing ones were convinced there were splendid opportunities for profit, they bought,andboughtbig. The world’s richest oil magnate and his son bought at bargains and will reap returns which will greatly increase their already overloaded treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And to help insure that profit, and to help forestall any further crash of prices which might eventually the sounder values of their present holdings, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they issued, statements to the effect that they were buying;</span><span class="font6"> and so unusual was the action of such advertising from this quarter that the turn-about-face of the market, ■which was about due, received an added impetus. Big business also got on the job. One big bank official macle long distance calls all over the United States, requesting that extra dividends be given out to the newspapers from the score of large industries of which he was a director, to help influence and insure confidence in the market 1 Captains of industry were profuse in assertions that business was on a sound basis. Once on the up-grade, big business tumbled ail over itself patting each other on the back with reassurances (for public consumption). They advertised in the newspapers for all the world to read; asserted confidence in the business of the nation; that earnings were better than usual; that values had not changed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so, buying low, these benefactors (?) will quietly unload their holdings when prices are high, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the -fact will not be advertised</span><span class="font6"> to the buying public, you may rest assured 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Editorial comment also was to the effect that, while the investing and speculating public overdid the adjusting of prices, basically the financial and banking world withstood the shock with the greatest confidence and security; that the foundations of our money system, since the Federal Reserve Bank has served to unify and reinforce the banking structure, appears to have been firmly established. There were no runs on the banks, they say; no bank, financial or brokerage houses were crushed to the wall as heretofore; business is not affected; and the fact that the Federal Reserve Bank was able to fully meet all the demands made upon it while assisting in the recovery of the falling market was shown as evidence of this security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Undoubtedly the financial structure has been reinforced, for such a shock wculd have caused</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AND A MIS-HTY AN4EL TOOK A STONE - EKE UNTO A HIULSTONE,</span></p><img src="g_E_19300122_files/g_E_19300122-19.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:265pt;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">And Its Fall</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">a nation-wide panic only' ten years ago. Yet; basically, what has been done? Unity is strength, and it was only a matter of volume, mere mass of money, centrally located, and distributed through cooperative agencies or banks, that made a workable protection of this latest financial orgy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But for every cause there is an effect. Like the man who had tw<sup>T</sup>o radios sent to his house for trial, and returned them both when the market slashed his pocketbook, so in hundreds of thousands of cases business is going to feel the effects of canceled and limited purchases for many months to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Business may be sound according to the present leaders, but of the effect of curtailed purchasing power there can be no doubt. Business has been hurt far more than outw<sup>r</sup>ard appearances indicate!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So it is worthy to note another feature of these slight tremors of the financial institution. Slight, because it will be INSIGNIFICANT when the greatest earthquake the world has ever seen or known shakes the foundations of this unjust and unsound system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The financial world could well ask itself what would have been the result of this 1929 crash had it come at a more delicate time in the affairs of men and nations!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And what will be the result of the final catastrophe should unemployment sear the souls of men whose empty pockets rebel against vast manipulations of wealth, or should the fears of financial disaster merge with the rumors and threats of war ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Financial leaders, while somewhat anxious regarding future activities, probably feel fairly secure in having passed through the recent frenzy. But -will they attempt to correct the errors in the system? As one financial news wu'iter said, “Something is radically wrong when a calamity of this kind can occur, and some measure should be taken to prevent a recurrence even if the whole method of security trading must be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes indeed! But the desire for gold and the power it gives will never permit them to discard the agencies for its accumulation. They will not attempt to curb the element of gambling, or its pools, manipulations, margin accounts, pyramiding of paper profits, etc.; but the real tragedy lies in the fact that actual sound values and productive labor must suffer through frenzied and speculative gambling. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in these uncertain times, the “wise servant” is not confounded by these systems, with their unsound and widely-fluctuating values !</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Hard on the Bookkeeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> DISPATCH from New York says: “Staten</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Island’s &quot;million dollar’ bootlegger, John J. Dunne, has compromised for $100,000 the $498,737.11 income tax and penalties assessed on his bootleg profits by the government, it was announced today. The announcement was made by assistant United States attorney James E. Wilkinson in Brooklyn federal court when Dunne pleaded guilty to an indictment returned against him for failure to report his bootleg earnings. He was fined $2,000 and sentenced to a year in prison, the prison term being suspended.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is quite a hardship on Mr. Dunne’s bookkeeper. He seems to be the only one to suffer, but it may take the bookkeeper half an hour to straighten the thing out. Possibly something else besides the income tax of $100,000 and the fine of $2,000 was shaken out of that $498,737.11; but even if it was another $100,000, Mr. Dunne is getting out of it very v^ell and is still $296,737.11 to the good. Well Dunne!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Safety in the Electrically Equipped Home </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Vinzens Spath, Electrician</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HpHE following may prove helpful to prevent -L the tragedies of preventable electrocution so often reported in our daily papers in the city and country alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the most part I have noticed these occurrences are of the “low voltage” type, except where experienced electricians are mentioned, a fact wdiich makes it all the more deplorable because they are most easily preventable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> low voltage case of electrocution the muscles of the body in the path of the electric current, from the hands to the ground or from one hand to the other, gradually stiffen and tighten, thereby preventing free movement to get away. Death finally takes place through suspended animation. The time elapsing between may be from a fe~w minutes to one hour, depending on local conditions. This leaves a fair space of time for some one to do something to avoid death, if done promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you are caught with your hands cramped on a pipe, cord, or machinery, with your feet on the bare ground or concrete floor, or for that matter even a wet wooden or metal floor, the first proper thing to do, of course, is to shut off the power by some one; but if you happen to be alone and unable to attract somebody’s attention to help you, then a strong concentration of your will power may easily free you; but if you give up, in a little while the chances are much against you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Look around you if you can see a board or box or even a bunch of newspapers or magazines, or most anything dry and non-metallic. If you could work yourself toward it or work the object toward yourself to stand on it to clear yourself from the ground, and could thereby break the circuit, or give a sudden pull to free your cramping hold, it would likely save your life. You may hurt yourself slightly by so doing, but it is preferable to the visit of an undertaker, coroner, and flowers on your grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To illustrate my theory, the following may serve as an example. A plumber was repairing a steam boiler. He was using the old-fashioned defective extension cord, getting close to the boiler, and he got his feet in a puddle of water in a low place directly in front of the fire box. Having hold of the defective cord with his hands, the electric power took a path through his arms, chest, legs, and feet. AU of the affected muscles gradually stiffened tighter, so he was unable to move. Finally he fainted and fell over to one side, out of the boiler pit. This act got his feet clear of the water, and thereby broke the circuit for the most part, thus saving his own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He could have accomplished his safety much easier and quicker before without fainting, by trying to move himself out of the water by leaning against the raised floor and throwing himself backward oi' sidewise, thereby lifting both feet out of the water; oi’ he could have smashed the lamp of his cord against the boiler or floor or the wall, causing the fuses of this circuit to burn out, which would have freed him quickly and easily. But the ounce of prevention is even better:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Break away from the age-long and dangerous habit of using any old cord, especially the cheap cord; the best is none too good or too safe. There is not much safety in a pretty silk cord; it is no safer than the old-style lamp cord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are several reliable brands on the market designed for wet or damp places; Brewery, Packing House, or Tyrex, which has an outer rubber cover, with a substantial composition or mica weatherproof socket, would offer much more safety in residential basements, kitchen, or bathrooms, where your hands are likely to be damp or wet from your work; there is little or no safety in a metal shell key or keyless socket in such places named above in close proximity to water pipes, furnaces, kitchen ranges, kitchen sink;?, or bathroom fixtures. When you are operating your electric devices in the basement, a good precaution is to wear the old-fashioned rubbers; toecap rubbers are useless for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, the lighting fixtures immediately below the kitchen and bathrooms should be “weatherproof”. Washing machines, ironing machines, and electric ranges should be effectively and permanently grounded, but such grounding of devices is not and should not lie accepted as a cure-all for everything, as this article plainly shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One case of trouble in which I -was called upon will demonstrate the value of “weatherproof” construction of wiring in the residential basement or anywhere where there is excessive dampness. A family just moved into a home in Rose City Park Addition, and, finding the place very dirty, proceeded to clean and scrub the</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ne qOLDEN AGE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">kitchen floor in the real grand style: pouring a bucket of water on the floor and starting to scrub. Soon they needed more water, then the trouble began. As soon as they would touch a kitchen faucet or sink, they would get a jolt enough to knock them down. The fact was, the kitchen was the most unsafe place in the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I found the water leaked through the floor and along the joists to the old-fashioned and still much-used porcelain rosette and drop cord, thereby electrically charging the wet kitchen floor and creating a difference of potential, that you could not take hold of a faucet without getting a terrible shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I simply removed the old porcelain rosette and drop cord and installed a weatherproof socket in the basement. As a consequence, safety was immediately reestablished in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Controlling switches for washing machines should never be mounted directly on the machine itself, but rather on the ceiling, wall, or post near or above the machine, and should be preferably a ceiling pull switch, double-pole, indicating “On” and “Off”, and operative with a strong cord, within easy reach, and installed “weatherproof”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So-called “Heater Cord”, asbestos covered, is unsafe for use in kitchens, bathrooms, basements, or anywhere where some one is liable to take hold of it with wet or damp hands and in close proximity to grounded devices. It is most deceptive because this type of cord is insisted upon by the National Board of Fire Underwriters, and consequently by many municipal electric inspection departments, for use with portable electric heating devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all my twenty-five years’ experience I have failed to realize the so much crowed-about safety of it, but a short time ago a woman was electrocuted here in Portland. The electric contractor supplied Heater Cord on a washing machine. While using this washer in the basement of her home, for some reason she held this cord with her wet hands while standing on the wet concrete floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to reports of the press, the -woman died about an hour later. She was alone in the house at the time and help arrived too late. It was true that the Heater Cord should not have been installed on the washer; but what about it had she been using a portable electric cooker with specified “Heater Cord” in the basement, such as many people use for auxiliary service ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What would have prevented her death? The safety of this type of cord seems to exist solely in the highly imaginative minds of its designers and fire insurance agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My view, as expressed above, may be somewhat at variance with the latest ideas expressed in the electrical code, but experience has taught me to appreciate the ounce of prevention to gain “Safety First”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another dangerous stunt is the practice by some of placing pennies back of burnt-out fuses. Fuses are put in by electricians to act as automatic circuit breakers to protect the building and its contents from too great overloads on wires; but when a penny or some other piece of metal is placed back of the fuse plug, the automatic circuit breaker and safety both cease to exist and danger and grief are likely to follow in one form or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All grown-up members of families' should know where to shut off the gas, water, and electric power. Right here is the worst failure in most homes. In proportion, most people do not know that much of their own premises. Right here in this supposedly modern city I have seen places without a proper switch to shut off the power, or where the switches and fuses are mounted in such inaccessible places as to make them useless in case of necessity. Where is safety and prevention under such circumstances ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many homes have been flooded because the people at home did not know where to shut off the water. Many people have been asphyxiated with gas at home because the much used small gas valves were leaky and no proper main valves provided near the gas range to shut it off completely. The same is true of many gas-fired water heaters, both manual and automatic, with the additional danger of explosion because the pilot flame has gone out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Soap and Water Safer than Calomel</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(By Dr. Alex. C, Barthels, Superintendent of ths Edinburgh School of Natural Therapeutics, Member of the Society of British </span><span class="font2">Naturopaths.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font6">I IN TEREST has been called to an article in the August 7 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font6">entitled “A Paragraph from a Government Letter”, in which a correspondent quotes the Bureau of Public Health Service, Washington. It states that “one-fifth of all hospital days required for treatment of American seamen in Marine hospitals are due to venereal diseases”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In order to grapple to some extent with this growing menace, a certain shipping company has been requested to establish a.station aboard each ship where the crew may receive precautionary treatment. After they have been ashore, the sailors are required to use soap and running water and to apply the necessary prophylactic calomel ointment. This is to be obtained in tubes at about five cents each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“So venereal disease can be cured or prevented for five cents. On what grounds, then, has the public been swindled by expensive treatments? Why has this simple information been so long withheld from the public?” Such are the indignant questions which are asked by the correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the opinion of many thinkers and those of practical experience that it is just as w<sup>T</sup>ell that the public has not been able to buy a dangerous poison at five cents a dose. For the active principle of calomel is mercury, a heavy metal which is liable to accumulate in the system to the destruction of nervous and other tissue. It is used by the medical profession as a caustic against venereal sores and inflammations, and their own text-books on toxicology give the symptoms of chronic mercurial poisoning as parallel to those of tertiary syphilis. The drug has been used to such an extent that it would not be easy to find today any one suffering from the tertiary stage who had not at one time received mercurial treatment. At the same time, history does not tell of constitutional syphilitic symptoms until after the advent of suppressive drugs, although syphilis, as an acute disease, has been recorded throughout the ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If our conscience and our reason thus deprive us of one of the so-called standbys in the handling of venereal conditions, if, in short, mercury is seen to be a determining factor, if not the determining factor, in the production of tertiary syphilis, we must find some other’ form of treatment. We must study in other channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As an encouragement, I would refer to the books of Dr. Hermann, who for thirty years at the end of the last century was superintendent of the syphilitic wards in the famous Hospital Weiden, near Vienna, Austria. He claims that during this time he handled sixty thousand cases of venereal disease without the use of mercury, and that not in a single case thus treated and cured did he observe a spontaneous recurrence, an exhibition of tertiary symptoms or hereditary transmission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I refrain from indicating the lines along ■which Dr. Hermann worked. The public should not experiment with a serious ailment except under considered advice. I merely ask the authorities to leave poisonous administrations to those interested in cruelty, suicide, and murder, and to turn their attention to the enforcement of that cleanliness in the human system which only the sanitary engineer seems to appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps there will come a day when we will all refuse to endanger our physical fitness by associating with that which is unclean, but, in the meantime, if there has been any difficulty, let us go hard for the soap and water and avoid the calomel as we would the plague.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">I.B.S.A. Colporteur Meets His Waterloo on Island of Corsica</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By A. E. Rossetti</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">T HAVE just recently taken a week's eanvass-J- ing trip on the island of Corsica. Colpor-' tears have varied experiences, but this trip contained a few, not severe ones, but odd ones. I shall try to retake some of them and also tell how I met my “Waterloo'<sup>1</sup>’ there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We often hear of the saying that history repeats itself, but such was not the ease this time. Napoleon, a. man scarcely over five feet tall, came from Corsica to France, won many victories, and met his defeat at Waterloo. With me, a man not a great deal over five feet in height, I went from France to Corsica, won victories in the larger cities, and met my Waterloo there, right in Napoleon’s native town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But before telling of this “defeat” I shall mention some points about Corsica itself, an island probably not much heard of by anybody. It is situated in the Mediterranean Sea, about sixty-two miles west of Italy, and about 105 miles southeast of France. It is rather oblong in shape; its area approximately 5,500 square miles, and its population about 300,000 people. The island of Sardinia lies just south of it. Sardinia belongs to Italy, while Corsica belongs to France. There are regular boat services from Nice and Marseilles to Corsica, making from one to two round trips a week each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are some level lands in different places along the coast of Corsica, but it quickly rises to hills and then to high mountains. The main backbone of the mountains runs north and south along the center of the island. Some timber, mostly pine, grow<sup>r</sup>s here and there, sparingly up to the vegetation line, and above that, the rock ledges rise high and barren to peaks, the highest 8,900 feet from sea level (but no snow, at least not now in summer).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more mountainous parts have goats and sheep only, mostly goats. Clusters of houses (villages) are seen here and there up the mountainsides, similar’ to the Swiss villages in the Alps. The Corsican mountaineer has the advantage over the Swiss in that he is always seen with “old faithful” at his side, the burro, doing the packing for him, while the Swiss usually has to carry his load himself on his back. The Swiss can not afford to keep a burro, because the winters are too long. That is, from early autumn, when it begins snow’ing, till late spring, the burro would have to be tied up in the barn, eating daily, and nothing for him to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">do. Hay, etc., are precious goods in the Alps, and the Swiss sees that what service he can get out of the burro in the summer months will not compensate him for keeping the animal; so he tightens his belt, grits his teeth, and gets under the load himself. But restitution is at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Goat raising being one of the industries of Corsica, good nippy cheese, made principally of goat’s milk, is served, preferably in the restaurants. A rare treat for one who likes it; and I am one who does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two largest cities are Bastia, with about 33,000 population, on the northeast side of the island, and Ajaccio, with about 23,000 inhabitants, about two-thirds of the way down on the west coast. These two cities are connected by a narrow-gauge railway. The distance by railway is approximately 100 miles. The railway line crosses the high mountains. The altitude of the highest railway station is about 3,300 feet. There are numerous tunnels, mostly short ones. The scenery is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the grades are rather steep. We had a double-header over the steepest part, for a distance of about eighteen miles. One engine was a regular four-wheel drive, while the other was a combination of a double engine. .That is, it had four drive wheels on each side, but two cylinders on each side, one cylinder located at the usual position, and another just like it located about midway of the four wheels, each cylinder driving two wheels. It was the first of its kind I have seen. I did not inquire which of the two makes of engines w<sup>r</sup>as the more satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The entire railway project seems an expensive one, and it is a wonder how they can make it pay. The rates are reasonable. The line was constructed before the war. Aside from the main line mentioned, it has one or two minor branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Corsica has been under many flags in its history. It came under the French flag about 1769. French is taught in all the schools, but in general conversation among themselves the Corsicans will stick to their dialect. It is a dialect of almost pure Italian. At Nice and Mionte Carlo, close to Italian frontier, the French people speak a dialect with many &quot;words of Italian or part Italian. The Marseillaise have their dialects with much less Italian in it, but the Corsican is almost clear Italian. However, it is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">spoken, not with the Tuscano accent, but strong on the Napolitano accent, as Italians from Naples speak it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In our compartment on the train (shall explain later the meaning of compartment) were a French couple and grown daughter, tourists, with map in hand and observing route and scenery. There w’ere also a Corsican lady and two Corsican men. Corsicans chatter together loudly, no matter where. And so these Corsicans were talking away in their own dialect, and laughing, while their brethren, the French tourists (who had apparently landed on the island that morning), sat silent as statues, and looked rather amazed, for they could not understand a word of it. The Corsican lady, realizing the situation, and being of a talkative disposition, began to speak in French to the tourists, which eased them considerably. All this rather amused me, to see people of the same nation einbarassed over the language, while I, who am American, but can speak Italian, as well as some French, could understand both the Corsican and the French. Glorious will be that day when all people shall be of one language!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another train incident: After we were some stations out from the terminus, and while the train was running (and it runs at a fair speed for a narrow-gauge), I saw a railway employee walking along the outside of the train coaches, and putting his hands through the open windows and holding himself to the window sills as he went along. It was warm, and most windows were open; so he could go along somewhat easily. His feet were resting on a board that runs the length of the coaches (the old model coaches). This board runs along the outside, one step below the floor line. It serves as the step in boarding and getting off the train; for those coaches have the seats running cross-vase, the width of the coach, with a door at each end of the seat, and a window in each door. Both sides of the coaches are nothing but a string of doors. The coaches are partitioned off in compartments, two seats facing each other and running the width of the coach, to each compartment. On this narrow-gauge line there was room for four persons to each seat, making eight for each compartment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I first thought that this employee walking along the outside in that manner was taking a chance, and would be given a talking to if caught ; hut we had not gone many more stations, when, unexpectedly, the conductor was putting his arms and head through the window at which I was sitting, and with punch in hand, and unconcernedly, was saying, “Tickets, please.” After punching the tickets of all in our compartment, he went on to the next, always hanging on the outside of the coaches, and all while the train was running. It is of no use, every locality has its own peculiar methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People of smaller localities are generally more honest than in large cities. And so an air of honesty and fairness prevails in Corsica, yet the following occurred: I came to a restaurant in the middle of the forenoon and approached the waitress with the books. She decided to take one, and -went to get her purse, which was hanging on the hat rack near the kitchen door, together with her coat and hat. The mistress’ coat, etc., were hanging there also. The waitress was surprised to find her purse empty, and remarked that she had three small pieces of paper money in it when she put the purse there in the morning, and now it was all gone. She called the mistress and told the story. The mistress said that paper money was taken from her purse there not long ago, and believes the guilty one is a man who often comes there to eat and lingers about somewhat. She told the waitress that no one should leave a purse there any more; but should put it away in a secure place. The waitress had to borrow the money from the mistress to buy the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another incident, but a happy one: A lady was down in a creek, barefooted, almost kneedeep in water, washing clothes on a large rock. She was the wife of the oil agent at the wharf. Her neighbor called to her that I was selling books. She answered that the sailors bring her all the books she needs. “But sailors do not bring you this kind of book,” said I, as I walked to the bank and held up </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp.</span><span class="font6"> She said, “I can not read French; I am Italian.” I then spoke to her in that language and brought out the same books in Italian. She walked up out of the water to the bank, and bought </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, </span><span class="font6">cloth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scenario,</span><span class="font6"> and a booklet. She seems to be searching, and may it be so; for to search and live up to the light found is the grace that makes man free.—John 8: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catholicism prevails on the island, but is fast losing ground. People are commencing to think for themselves, and it is high time. Our literature took well, but no real wide-awake interest was found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Napoleon was born at Ajaccio, the second largest city of Corsica. The Napoleon mansion (Napoleon’s father’s house, where Napoleon was born), still stands, and is used as a national monument. Visitors are admitted on certain days of the week. Only the original furniture is in it. It is a laige mansion, and from the furniture one can see that Napoleon’s father was a well-to-do man in his day. He was a lawyer and judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But all this does not tell how I met my &quot;Waterloo” in Corsica. Considering other matters, I could see before starting that I could not remain in Corsica more than a week on this trip; so I took with me a supply of books accordingly. And I thought I made the calculation stronger on the over side than on the less. But I worked fast in three cities, in the week’s time (but did not finish any of them), and my supply kept going down, until in the forenoon of the last day I was there my supply of French books gave out. The boat did not sail until four p.m. Therefore a colporteur without books and with territory on hand and four hours’ time to go, I was as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> soldier on the battlefield run out of ammunition and having to surrender. This happened in Napoleon’s native town, Ajaccio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yea, I welcome such “Waterloos”. Far rather have placed all the literature with a few hours to spare than to have found dull ears and having to bring some of the literature back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">May the Lord add His blessing, that those who read the books may be benefited thereby. And may He grant us strength and courage to keep going, and to spread the message wider and wider.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Protestantism Near Its End</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> SUBSCRIBER in Portugal sends us the following translation of a news item which appeared in two Lisbon newspapers on the 29th of October. No wonder the Catholic papers are glad to print this item, for it shows that the death knell of Protestantism is sounding. The worst of it is that the poor simp that made the following statements does not even know that he is cutting his own throat. Who wants to hear anything that any man has to say when he admits that he believes nothing and has no message of hope, or comfort, or faith in God or in anything but his own conceit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT IJTERATURE IN THE BIBLE, SAYS A PROTESTANT CLERGYMAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">London, 28.—At the general conference which took</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">place in Worcester, there was an incident which caused a great scandal amidst the theological circle. Rascen, a clergyman of Liverpool, gave a lecture regarding the position and authority which the Bible occupies in the Christian life. After which another clergyman of Worcester, Rev. Locey, began by saying that it grieved him to have to offer a discordant opinion, as he does not consider the Bible as a book expressing the Divine Word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In my own opinion, he said, there is nothing in the Old or New Testament which can be candidly considered as having been revealed by God. According to Rev. Locey’s opinion, what is found in the Bible is simply a vast collection of valuable literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am very grieved, he concluded, by having to declare that the only thing I can find in the Bible, is a legion of men blindly seeking for God. And it is impossible to find anything else in it besides that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan in the Seminaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">H</span><span class="font6">L. M'encjken, noted newspaper man, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">« credited in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Outlook, and, Independent </span><span class="font6">of September 4, 1929, as saying, “By some hook or crook Satan has got into the seminaries of theology, and the clergy of tomorrow are being debauched.” Mr. Mencken has told the absolute truth. The graduates of the seminaries of today are infidels as to the Bible, and many of them are atheists at heart, having neither love nor reverence for God or for anything with which He has to do. Their only possible effect upon the people to whom they “minister” is to break down and destroy whatever of faith these may have. They hate and oppose the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HIS morning we continue to examine the arguments made by Job and his professed friends. I hope you have carefully read chapters 14-33 of the book of Job. As we progress you will be able to see who spoke the truth and who spoke falsely. Jehovah has announced the rule by which it may be determined what man is pursuing a wise course. By His prophet (Ps. 25:14) He says: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant,” On the contrary, the man who thinks more highly of himself than he ought to think, who is proud and wise in his own conceit, and who gives honor and glory to himself or to other men, is displeasing to the Lord God. Concerning such it is written that ‘God resists the proud and shows His favor to the humble’. (1 Pet. 5: 5) The proud and self-important ones speak the wisdom of men and therefore speak error. The humble man who maintains his faith in God often speaks the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus emphasized this point when He spoke concerning the sinner and the Pharisee who belonged to the clergy of that day. The Pharisee, with great self-satisfaction, prayed: ‘Lord, I thank Thee that I am not like other men.’ The sinner smote his breast and prayed to God, ‘Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner.’ Jesus said that the Pharisaical clergyman was condemned for his attitude, while the sinner received God’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Job heard the speech of his professed friends he recognized that they were pious hypocrites, and told them so. To them he said: “Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.” (Job 13:7,13) Then Job expressed his continued faith in God when he cried out: “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him; but I will maintain mine own ways before him.” (Job 13:15) He showed his faith in God’s love and mercy and his hope of a resurrection when he said: “0 that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.”—Job 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That statement of truth by Job angered Sa-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">tan. He therefore moved his agent Eliphaz to exalt himself in his own mind and speak error, that Job might have further suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This statement of Job was in direct contradiction of Satan’s first lie. (Gen. 3:4,5) Had every man an immortal soul, then it could not die, nor could it be awakened out of death and live again. Satan was angry because Job uttered this prophecy of truth concerning the resurrection of the dead, and he moved his agent, Eliphaz, to speak in response to Job’s declaration of truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee. Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.”—Job 15:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That speech is like unto the argument that the clergy have long used and continue to use against the humble and honest men who seek to learn and to express the truth of God’s Word. They claim that the clergy class is the repository of all wisdom; that the grayheaded sages, whom they call “fathers” in the church, are the only ones that should attempt to tell of a future life. They even go to the point of persecuting the humble men and women who try to study and teach the Word of God, which is the truth. Many a member of a church has been told by his pastor :-‘You had better not read any books or study for yourself. Leave all that to us preachers. We are the guardians of your soul, and your only teachers.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Eliphaz, representing the enemy, makes another attempt to cause Job to turn away from God by inducing him to believe that God would have no confidence in him. He goes to the ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tent of saying that God has no confidence in the holy angels of heaven, and therefore would not have any confidence in filthy man, even though he sought God in God’s appointed way. At the same time Eliphaz arrogates to himself all the wisdom from above, exactly as the clergy do today. “Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it; unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.”—Job 15:15-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Eliphaz proceeds to remind Job that he is wicked and that he must suffer the fate of the wicked. Job was not moved from his position of integrity by the bombastic words of his critics. “Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged; and though I forbear, what am I eased? But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.”—Job 16:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In their regular turn Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar continued to reproach Job and to remind him that God had visited him with these great calamities because of his wilful wickedness. Throughout the debate those three men repeatedly attempted to show Job that he will never be justified before God. Amidst it all Job insisted that his suffering was not because of his personal wickedness. He knew that he loved God and had done his best to serve Him so far as he knew. He maintained his integrity in holding fast his faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this part of the prophetic picture two things are emphasized, to wit: (1) That the three men who professed to be friends of Job represent the organization of Satan the enemy, and that their claim to represent God always corresponds to the members of the Devil’s organization who claim to represent God, and that these all bring reproaches upon God; and (2) that amidst all the misrepresentation of God throughout the ages God has brought some honest men through the warfare and enabled them to maintain their confidence and faith in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let every person of fair mind now consider how the facts fit the picture, and what opportunity is held forth to suffering humanity by the doctrines of the ecclesiastical systems. That all humankind, like Job, is full of putrid sores, no man can honestly attempt to gainsay. What, then, is contained in the doctrines of the ecclesiastical teachers that could comfort man ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic wing says: ‘If you join our church and follow the advice of the fathers of our church, when you die you will go to heaven. Otherwise you will go to “purgatory”; and if we are not able to get you out upon sufficient consideration, then you will spend eternity roasting in fire and brimstone.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Protestant wing says: ‘We represent God; and if you would be saved, you must join our church and follow the advice of our teachers or fathers of the church; otherwise you will 'spend your eternity in torment.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- Other branches of the Devil’s organization, the purpose of which is to turn men away from Gbd, teach men that there is no means of salvation by faith and obedience, but that man is a creature of evolution and will continue by his own efforts to increase in righteousness until he gets his great desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These ecclesiastical leaders claim to be the sole interpreters of the Scriptures; and in putting forth their false doctrines they are supported by the commercial and political elements of the world. Satan is the god thereof. There is no part of the so-called “organized Christianity” that tells the people anything about God’s purpose of redemption through the blood of Christ, resurrection from death, and restitution to life for the obedient ones on earth. The doctrines held forth by these ecclesiastical systems, and concurred in by their allies, not only fail to bring consolation to suffering humanity but tend to drive and do drive multitudes of people aw<sup>T</sup>ay from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ecclesiastical systems speak of Jesus and call Him the Redeemer, but their words are merely words of mockery, even as were the words of the three supposed friends of Job. The most that is said concerning Christ Jesus is that it is well to study His life as an example, and that His life was given to men for an example that men might attain unto a high character that would warrant their own salvation. The great majority of these ecclesiastical leaders deny that Jesus was any more than an ordinary sinful man. They openly deny the value of His sacrifice and repudiate the saving power of His blood. Today there is no ecclesiastical system under the sun that is teaching that the blood of Jesus was shed to provide the purchase price of man from death; that all men are born sinners, and that only through the blood of Christ can salvation come; and that in due time God will grant life to the obedient men on earth by resurrection and restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All these religious systems pose as God’s representatives, but in fact are members of Satan’s organization and are therefore frauds and “forgers of lies” and doctors of divinity with no value. All the systems of “Christendom” repudiate the kingdom of God on earth as a means of bringing peace, prosperity, and life, and instead adopt the Devil’s makeshift, the League of Nations, and hail it as the savior of mankind. Amidst it all a few men outside the religious systems maintain their integrity with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proof is therefore conclusive that in the picture the three professed friends of Job, who came as “physicians”; foreshadow the visible part of Satan’s organization, otherwise called “Christendom”, acting through its representatives, and which Satan uses for the purpose of turning men away from Jehovah God. The speech of the three men, who posed as Job’s friends, did no honor to Jehovah, but rather cast reproach upon His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Elihu</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another character appeared in the picture, and Elihu was his name. He was related to Abraham. (Gen. 22:20,21) He had faith in God like unto Abraham. He w<sup>r</sup>as the son of Barachel, which name means “who bends the knee before God”. The name Elihu means “God of him, my God is he; he is my God himself”. He was a young man. He was one of the silent audience that sat by and listened to the speech of the three professed friends of Job as well as that of Job. Throughout that discussion he said not a word until the three professed wise men had ceased their babble. “So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.”—Job 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Elihu listened to the discussion between Job and the three men, he became indignant against Job because Job justified himself rather than extolling Jehovah God. Elihu’s indignation boiled against the professed friends of Job because they had condemned Job and had not answered Job’s arguments. They exalted themselves and made their own self-righteousness appear. Elihu did not condemn Job as the three professed friends did. While lie did not approve the action of Job in speaking of his own righteousness, yet the words of Elihu offered, as an extenuation, that Job was ignorant of the real situation. He said: “'Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.”—Job 34:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this Job pictures many men of honesty of purpose who have never been able to understand that their sufferings were due to their own wilful wrong-doing because of being conscious of the fact that they had tried to do right. Likewise they have never been able to harmonize the claims of Christendom, so called, with a God of justice and love. They have been willing to submit their case to God, having faith that He would do to them that which was best. They have therefore rejected the doctrines of eccle-siasticism, and properly so, because as honest men they could see that such doctrines were not in harmony with the all-wise, just and loving Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elihu magnified Jehovah. As a young man he manifested respect for the gray-haired savants who had spoken before him, but he used no words of flattery because of their high standing. He began his speech in this manner: “I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. But there is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. Great men are not always wise; neither do the aged understand judgment. Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words; lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.”—Job 32:6-13, 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The praise and exaltation of men is never pleasing to God. In this connection I remind you that the prominent men of the Devil’s visible organization have always been men who exalted themselves and their fellow men. The Avhole period of “Christendom” has been an age of hero-worship. Visit any of the art galleries of Europe or America and you will see the tangible evidence of this statement. In every celebrated painting Avhere the power of a nation or government is shown, there stands forth prominently in the picture the great warrior; by his side the great statesman, and with the two the clergyman, indicated by his garb and his sanctimonious face. The manifest purpose is to overawe the populace and impress them with the greatness of these men, and to cause the people to pay homage to the great leaders of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let it be understood also that such celebrated painting’s are further proof of the close union between the financial power, the warrior, the statesmen and the clergy. It is another tangible proof that these are the visible agencies of Satan’s organization. It should be expected, therefore, that they would laud and praise men of their own organization. Why should they do this? The answer is that it has always been the purpose of the Devil to cause men to worship any creature, that man might be turned away from Jehovah God and his devotion be given to others than Jehovah God. Let it be set down as a rule to which there is no exception, that where there is adulation and praise and Avorship heaped upon men, such is the result of the subtle influence of the Devil to turn men away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religionists have fallen into this trap at all times. The Jews have magnified the names of their rabbis and exalted them. The members of the Catholic church have exalted their clergy and even called them saints. The members of the Protestant ecclesiastical systems have exalted their clergy and hailed them as great and mighty men. It is true that this has been due largely to ignorance on the part of the people. It is also true that that ignorance has been induced by Satan the enemy. Many Christians who have allied themselves with neither Catholics nor Protestants have also exalted men to their own injury. It may be laid down as a safe rule that where a person professes to be devoted to God and at the same time is exalting any man or men he will have great difficulty in standing the test and proving his complete faithfulness to God. The majority of such fall away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elihu assigned the reason for the disastrous results to those who worship men. He said: “Let me not . . . give flattering titles unto man . . . ; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.” (Job 32: 21, 22) His words are really prophetic. Many have been taken away from the Lord because of flattering words. Many have fallen because they have been willing to receive words of flattery heaped upon them. But one might ask, Why would God take away one who flatters men? The answer is quite apparent when Ave understand the great controversy that has long existed betAveen JehoAmh and the DeA<sup>7</sup>il. Let it be kept in mind at all times that Satan the Devil has tried and is trying to alienate all creation from God. Let it also be kept in mind that JehoA<sup>r</sup>ah has said, 'There is no other God besides me.’ Remember that no creature can get life except by and through Jehovah. Therefore if a man who claims to be a servant of the Lord Avould give flattering titles to men, and laud and magnify men and make heroes of men, he Avould be folloAving the lead and the instruction of Satan the Devil, and not folloAving the Lord and being obedient to the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every creature that is pleasing to the Lord God must welcome the knowledge that comes to him of the distinction between God and Satan, and take his stand unequivocally on the side of Jehovah. Elihu put himself on the side of Jehovah and unequivocally stood for Jehovah God. This is important also to keep in mind as a rule that should be followed by all avIio are pleasing to the Lord. The great sage of Israel, Paul, in his day saw the danger of receiving flattery and giving flattery to men. He said: “Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ri* QOLDEN AGE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”—1 Cor. 3: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Addressing Job, Elihu said: “Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy. He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. Behold, in this thou art not just; I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. For God speak-eth once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.” —Job 33:8-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Job had spoken without understanding. He could understand that his suffering was not because of his wilful sin against God. His professed friends had not taught him in the right way, even as the clergy have not taught the people in the right way concerning God and why men suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Elihu proceeded with his speech in praise of Jehovah God. The words of Elihu were prophetic and told of the Lord’s purpose to stay the destructiveness of sickness and death, and to redeem or ransom man; and that those who will then be obedient to God, after receiving knowledge, shall be restored to the days of their youth. His were words of life, showing God’s purpose to give life to man by means of redemption, resurrection and restitution. He first shows the human race, pictured by a man sick, afflicted, emaciated, and almost dead. He shows man abhorring everything about him, even his bread and meat, because of his great suffering, and then points out that if there be with man a messenger to interpret and make plain the right way, God is gracious to man and delivers him from going down to the grave; and he assigns as the reason therefor the great ransom provision. His words are;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and ths multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he shall return to the days of his youth; he shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy; for he will render unto man his righteousness. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.”— Job 33:18-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, through Elihu, God caused to be spoken the great truth of His purpose to redeem fallen and suffering humanity through the precious blood of Christ Jesus and that in due time He would bring all men to a knowledge of the truth. This prophecy further proves that in His own due time Jehovah would have on earth some who vrould speak His message of truth fearlessly and boldly and give God all the credit therefor and that the truth thus spoken would bring consolation to all those who hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next Sunday consideration will be given to the message of truth, which message and understanding thereof throws a flood of light on some important events that are coming to pass in our day. In the meantime please read Job, chapters 33 to 38, inclusive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bible Question and Answer</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19300122_files/g_E_19300122-21.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font6"> A writer asks: “Which is the Lord’s sabbath day? is it Saturday, or is it Sunday?” Another letter asks: “Which is the sabbath, the first day of the week, or the last day?” Still another letter asks: “What is the sabbath that the Christian is to keep?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font6"> “Sabbath” means repose, cessation. Genesis 2:1-3 reads: “And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[shabath]</span><span class="font6"> on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified -it; because that in it he had rested </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[shabatli}</span><span class="font6"> from all his work which God created and made.” Some professed Christians claim that this mere statement is a command from Jehovah fastened upon His human creatures, requiring them to keep a weekly sabbath; but there is no Bible record whatsoever that Adam 01* any of God’s faithful servants up to the time the Hebrews or Jews left Egypt observed such a sabbath day. The verses just quoted refer to God’s great rest day, which day is not twenty-four hours long, but is as long as each of the days in which He was creating some new features of our earth. According to Psalm 95, God was still resting from His earthly work over three thousand years after creating Adam; and according to the Apostle Paul’s argument in Hebrews, chapter four, God was still resting over four thousand years after man’s creation. It is into this rest or sabbath of God that properly instructed Christians enter through faith in God’s Word. According to the harmonious testimony of the Scriptures, God’s sabbath or rest day will not end until the close of the thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus, to whom God has assigned the work of restoring man to human perfection and reconciliation with God and making the whole earth a paradise. Thus God’s sabbath day toward earth’s creation will not end until seven thousand years after He made Adam. On the basis of this we conclude that each of the creative days was seven thousand years long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of this great sabbath day of His own, and in order to provide for the regular recuperation of fallen man from his weekly toil, God commanded a weekly sabbath day upon the Hebrews, whom He had just delivered from Egypt and with whom He had just entered into a covenant through Moses their mediator. The first Bible record of any human beings’ keeping a weekly sabbath is of the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sin. Due to the covenant which had been made by the slaying of the Passover lamb in Egypt, God began to give them a set of laws, and He established the weekly sabbath day among them (and no one else) as a “sign” between them and Himself. (Ex. 31:13; Ezek. 20:12,20) The law said: “The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God.” (Ex. 20:10) Hence this sabbath fell on what we today call Saturday, beginning really at sundown on Friday and lasting till only sundown of Saturday. The Hebrews, or Jews, were the only people ever under this sabbath day obligation; and although Jews today do not know it, the Lord Jesus released them from this sabbath obligation and all the rest of the law covenant by dying on the cross, “having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances” (Eph. 2:15), “and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.” (Col. 2:14) Hence Christians, whether formerly Jews or Gentiles, are not under a law to keep Saturday or Sunday or any other day of the week by a total resting from bodily work. Meeting together on Sunday is not observing a sabbath, but merely a commemoration of Jesus’ resurrection on the first day of the week and how the apostles used to assemble on that day and be visited by their risen Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, the Apostle Paul used to go into the synagogues of the Jews on their weekly sabbath day, but that was merely to get a large audience to preach the gospel to. In Galatians 4:10 he criticized Christians who wanted to make Jews of themselves by observing days, months, times, and years; in Colossians 2:16,17 he states that the Jewish sabbath day was a shadow of good things to come, which shadow passed out when the good things came with Christ’s coming. In Hebrews, chapter four, he shows that Christians enter into God’s great sabbath through faith in God’s provision for redemption and faith in the priestly work of redemption by Christ Jesus. It is a sabbath or rest of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">faith; </span><span class="font6">and true Christians enjoy this sabbath every day of the week, even though they may be required to work physically all week, including the first da;/ and the last. Like the Apostle Paul, Bible Students feel at liberty, therefore, to go out on Saturdays and Sundays, preaching tire gospel from door to door by mouth and books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J. W., Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Story Forty-four'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">S JESUS and His disciples went toward</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jerusalem they passed through the village of Jericho, near which they encountered two blind men sitting by the wayside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These blind men, knowing from the voices and tumult made by the great concourse of people that followed Jesus, that it was indeed Christ the Lord, raised their voices and cried: “Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people near by tried to silence them, fearing their outcries would disturb Jesus; but the blind men simply cried the louder, and their voices carried above the noise of the crowd, and Jesus heard them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He stopped and stood still, turned in their direction, and said: “What will ye that I shall do unto you ?” Then the poor blind men stretched forth their hands and cried, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And Jesus had compassion on them, and went up to them, and touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes were opened, and they saw, and glorified God, and followed Jesus in the multitude, rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Jesus and His disciples went to Jerusalem, to attend a certain feast of the Jews; but they did not stay long this time, for certain people had tried to stone Jesus for saying He was the Son of God. Although Jesus’ time was fast drawing short, the end was not yet due; therefore, He withdrew Himself into a part of Palestine beyond Jordan, where John the Baptist had first baptized, and there He stayed for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was during this sojourn in Perea that an occasion arose that called Jesus into Judaea, where He performed the most important miracle of His ministry. We say the most important one, because the effects of it were the most far-reaching, and what these effects were will appear in due course: for events were happening rapidly now, and every day brought Jesus’ earthly life nearer to its close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was the occasion that called Jesus from His retirement in Perea into the land of Judaea, and to the town of Bethany, wherein resided Mary and Martha, of whom we heard recently: these women had a brother, named Lazarus, who became very ill. In alarm lest he should die, they sent to Jesus, imploring Him to come and heal Lazarus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In those days there were but two modes of travel: walking, and riding upon an animal, such as an ass or camel. Jesus and His disciples owned no animals; they walked from place to place. So Lazarus had been dead four days when Jesus arrived in the town where he and his sisters had made their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following an ancient custom, the body of Lazarus had been wrapped in many thicknesses of linen and laid in a stone vault, or box, sealed with a mighty slab of stone laid upon its top. This box was chiseled from the solid rock in the floor of a natural eave, such places being very popular with the ancient Jews, who used them as tombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus must have been touched with sorrow when He thought of its being necessary to let poor Lazarus die, in order to strengthen the disciples’ faith; for the Bible says that when He and His followers, and Mary and Martha, were gathered at Lazarus’ tomb, “Jesus wept.” This is the shortest verse in the Bible, and the most touching, for it shows plainly the beautiful tenderness of heart of the great Son of God. and how even the death of a man whom it was His intention to raise immediately, affected His sympathetic and loving nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But not for long did Jesus weep. Stretching forth His hand toward the figure which lay in its stone box, He cried with a loud voice: “Lazarus, come forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And the dead man arose from the uncovered tomb, and came forth, swathed in the linen wrappings, which Jesus instructed those near by to take from him. And Lazarus, crying with a loud voice after he had been released from the grave-clothes, praised God and glorified the name of Him who had performed this wondrous deed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But did the Jews all feel the same as Lazarus about this? Were they all convinced that Jesus was truly God’s own Son? No, indeed. A few there were who believed, and of course the faith of Jesus’ own disciples was strengthened a him dredfold by this miracle; but some of those who were present carried the news of Jesus’ deeds to the high priests in the temple at Jerusalem, and the Bible says of this, that “from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">THIS IS THE PUBLISHER’S PREFACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font4">OR many centuries honest men have sought to understand the prophecies of the Bible. Many men have attempted to interpret such prophecies in advance of their fulfilment. All such have failed. The reason is that “no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation”. Never before has there been a book published that makes clear so much of the prophecies of the Bible as this book. The author claims no credit therefor. He does not even attempt to interpret the prophecies. He sets forth the facts, well known to ail, showing fulfilment of the prophecies and the proof that it is God’s due time to reveal to man the understanding thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font4">OR many centuries the name of Jehovah has been defamed. The reason why God has permitted this is made clear in this book. Best of all, the proof is conclusive that God’s due time is at hand to vindicate his name before all creation; this to be followed shortly by the establishment of the world in peace and righteousness and the blessing of the peoples with prosperity and life. The publisher ear not too strongly recommend this book. Written in plain phrase, it can be understood by all. No attempt is made to honor any creature. The purpose of the book is to honor the name of Jehovah and to open the eyes of the people to the truth.</span></p>

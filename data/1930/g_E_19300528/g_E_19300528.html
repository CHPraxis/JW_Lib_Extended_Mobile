Y., Wednesday, May 28, 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 279</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Air We Breathe</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE dictionary tells us that air is “the fluid which we breathe, and which surrounds the earth: the atmosphere. It is invisible, inodorous, insipid, transparent, compressible, elastic, and ponderable. By the ancient philosophers, air was regarded as an element; but modern science has shown that it is essentially a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, with a small amount of carbon dioxide, the average proportions being, by volume: oxygen, 20.96 percent; nitrogen, 79.00 percent; carbon dioxide, 0.04 percent. These proportions are subject to a very slight variability. Air also always contains some vapor of water”. In this article we hope to extend this definition somewhat. Incidentally, we remark at this point that the word “atmosphere” is a combination of two Greek words meaning vapor sphere, and in this article has the same meaning as air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oxygen means so much to us humans that if our supply is cut off for three minutes it is cut off for good, or at least until the resurrection. Certain bacteria thrive without oxygen; but not so man. He is particular about what he breathes, and wants the air about as he usually gets it, 21 percent oxygen. If it is above that, it burns him up too fast and would soon kill him. Going down the scale he can still get along fairly well on air that is 17 percent oxygen. A candle or oil flame goes out at </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">16y<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font7"> percent. The man’s power to work stops when the oxygen in his air gets down to 13 percent, and at that point the acetylene flame expires. Below this point men become dizzy, pant, have rapid heart beats and suffer headache, and at 8 percent become unconscious, with death near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An oxygen machine for safe deposit vaults has been invented which is valuable in cases where employees are locked in vaults by robbers, or are accidentally shut in. The machines produce enough oxygen to sustain life for two hundred hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oxygen is recovered from the air for use in the steel industry, wherein it is used for welding and cutting, to the extent of about three billion cubic feet a year. All the^plants in the world work day and night to put back into the air the oxygen which is daily used to feed all the fires of the world and keep all the living creatures warm. Every home is more healthful with plants growing in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nearly one-half of the weight of earth’s crust consists of oxygen. After everything that could be oxidized had been oxidized there is still enough left for all our needs, and the amount is practically always the same. This is true of the nitrogen also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Nitrogen and Ozone</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a good thing for us that about four-fifths of the air is composed of nitrogen and that it mixes with the oxygen instead of forming a chemical compound. It serves to dilute the oxygen which Ave breathe and prevent us from bursting into flame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The leguminous plants all know how to take nitrogen out of the air and convert it into food for man. Man knows something about how to do it too, but the nitrates which he procures from the clouds are not considered as good for the land as those obtained by nature herself in her own laboratory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nitrogen which men obtain from the air is used principally for the production of synthetic ammonia, nitric acid, and cyanamide for packing food products, testing telephone cables, filling periscope tubes, and for other purposes for which an inert gas is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is estimated that thunderstorms annually fix about one hundred million tons of nitrogen and this is deposited on the earth during showers in the form of nitric acid. The plants make good use of it. The lightning flash generates such intense heat that it causes some of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">nitrogen of the air to combine with the oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What was once supposed to be natural ozone is now believed to be nitrogen peroxide. It is more abundant in summer than in winter, and is most noticeable during thunderstorms and in heavy winds. None can be detected in city air, and air over marshes and in malarial regions contains very little of it. Ozone when made in the laboratory is produced by the action of electric discharges upon oxygen, and is probably produced in the air in the same way. Ozone is used in sterilizing water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a variable amount of ammonia in the air, partly occurring as a nitrate and partly as a carbonate. The amount decreases during a heavy rain, but returns to the normal amount shortly afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The blue of the sky, the aurora borealis, and the zodiacal light are all attributable to a stream of frozen, crystalline nitrogen in extremely high altitudes. This nitrogen frost is believed to be in a dispersed state and to be electrically charged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Discovery of Helium</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The discovery of helium in America was made at Dexter, Kansas, in a singular manner. A well was being drilled for natural gas. Finally the vein was struck, a holiday was declared, a great crowd collected, the well was opened, and a blazing torch was thrust into the gas which gushed forth. Instead of the expected fireworks the torch went out and the people went home disgusted. If the people had only known it, that pocket of helium gas was worth, at that time, about $2,000 a cubic foot. For years this gas, often met with in southern Kansas, was called 'wind gas’ and allowed to waste into the air. Helium was first discovered in the sun in 1868, and in the atmosphere in 1894.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Helium is a non-inflammable, non-explosive gas of great “lifting power”, ideal for use in dirigibles. At a plant at Amarillo, Texas, the government now manufactures it out of natural gas at a cost of 1.2 cents a cubic foot. The natural gas is reduced to a temperature of 317 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit), at which point it becomes a liquid and the helium is drawn off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The temperature of 317 degrees below zero represents such intense cold that if the human hand could be put into the mixture it would freeze solid in a fraction of a second and drop off. A fresh piece of beefsteak dropped into the mixture and afterward dropped on the floor breaks into a thousand pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When shot through with an electric current helium gives a pinkish white light. The gas is tasteless, colorless, and odorless. When mixed with 21 percent of oxygen it can be breathed. It is used in rectifying alternating currents in radio battery eliminators. Liquid helium has been subjected to a temperature of 458 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit) and even at that temperature showed no indications of solidifying. Helium comprises fifty-four one-hundred-thousandths of one percent of the earth’s atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Noble Gases</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The noble gases, argon, neon, krypton and xenon, are all of recent discovery, though man has been breathing all of them ever since he has been upon the earth. Argon was discovered in 1894-5; neon, krypton, and xenon, in 1898. The gases are called “noble” because they are rare and because they do not combine with any other elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Argon constitutes ninety-three hundredths of one percent of the air, neon twelve ten-thousandths of one percent. Krypton and xenon are still more rare, comprising together only fifty-five millionths of one percent. Xenon sells in England for $13,650 a liter, or about the same as radium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In their rarefied condition, when shot through with an electric current, argon glows with a blue color, neon 'with a fiery orange red, krypton with a pale violet, and xenon with sky blue and green. All these gases are now much used to create striking display advertising effects, the gases being enclosed in glass tubes, of any desired size or design. Inside the tubes are suitable electrodes between which a high tension current is passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The high visibility of the neon light, and its peculiar fog-penetrating quality, have given it an important place in aviation. The tallest buildings in New York have neon beacons on their roofs to guide airplanes. Helium, argon, and neon are all used in wireless photography and television. Neon is used in a type of lightning arrester. There are now fifteen thousand neon signs in the United States. Argon is used as a filler for incandescent lamp bulbs and is estimated to save the country three hundred million dollars a year in electric light bills.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>The Ignoble Gases</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Probably if it is right to refer to argon, neon, krypton and xenon as noble gases because they are rare and expensive and do not combine with other elements, it would be all right to refer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as ignoble ones, because they are plentiful in these days, all too plentiful, and hard to get rid of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In considering the great number of automobiles and trucks constantly pouring carbon monoxide gas into the streets, the health commissioner of Chicago has estimated that more people are dying from contaminated air than from any other cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Carbon dioxide pours out of every public and private chimney and stack, mounted or stationary. This is food for the plants, which take it in through their leaves, separate the carbon from the oxygen, keep the carbon to build up their structure, and breathe out the pure oxygen so that it may be reused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the carboniferous era the atmosphere was heavily freighted with carbon dioxide. Great portions of it went into the massive plants and trees then flourishing in the earth, and much of it, no doubt, into deposits of limestone and other carbonated minerals and rocks.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Sand, Dust, Smoke, Soot</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">If we had no sand, dust, smoke or soot in the air, we should have no beautiful sunrises or sunsets, and, worst of all, no rain; yet it would not be hard to convince any housewife that there is such a thing as having too much of a good thing along this line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor II. II. Sheldon, of the physics department of New York University, declares that the air above New York city always has twenty-one hundred tons of this material in suspension, while on windy days the amount is more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the summits of New York’s tallest skyscrapers it is often impossible to see the streets, because of these motes. They stand between humans and the sun, cutting off the ultra-violet rays, so necessary for bone development, and predisposing city children to rickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the highest parts of the skies the little motes of dust wander hither and thither looking for passengers, here a little water-vapor and there a little more, until finally there is enough to form a drop and the journey back to mother earth may begin. Sometimes these dust particles are in the air for years before they settle. After every great volcanic eruption the atmosphere becomes heavily freighted with this “highest part of the dust of the world”.—Prov. 8:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The last few years have seen much scientific and unscientific counting of dust particles. It seems that St. Louis is our dustiest city, and Boston our cleanest one, that is, cleanest in its physical aspects, but most certainly not in the sense of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New York city air during 1929 averaged to carry 38,508 dust particles for each cubic foot. The dustiest day was in March, and the least dusty one in August. The dustiest places are at the street level, and the least dusty places are on the top floors of the highest buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Country atmospheric dust consists of finely powdered mineral matter blown up from the ground, a few crystals, mostly salt, and, in season, pollen from plants and spores from rusts or molds. Soot and ash compounds of sulphur and tar are added in the suburbs, and more soot and ash and dust from building operations in the city. Suburban dust particles are about twice the size of country dust particles, and city particles about three times their size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soot, unburned fuel, is deposited in the air chiefly by domestic fires. The larger furnace plants are more careful in their fuel consumption and discharge into the air little but fine mineral dust in the form of ashes and cinders. These two materials, soot and cinders, are easily distinguished under the microscope. The average to come from the combined chimneys and stacks is about four-fifths soot to one-fifth cinders. The smoke nuisance can not be stopped altogether without shutting down business completely. Even over the center of the greatest ocean there are as many as 750 dust particles in a thimbleful of air.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Air-Filter Engineering</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Air-filter engineering is a new business, developed in the last few years. Such air filtering as was done formerly was with the aid of cheese cloth, now no longer employed for the purpose. Such screens used to choke and cut off the air supply, besides needing frequent cleaning. Air is now scrubbed by sprays which not only rid it of dust but fix its temperature and humidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air filters are now commonly installed in all the new places of public assemblage, hotels, libraries, clubs, theaters, schools, museums. They are also installed in food factories, such as those engaged in the production of cheese, gelatin, oleomargarine, dried milk and ice cream. They are also widely used in factories to prevent the admission of injurious abrasive dusts to valuable machinery and perhaps to the lungs of “less valuable” men. Every home should be ventilated with filtered air, and will be, some happy day. Think of the countless hours that women spend and must spend simply in keeping down the dust which now finds its way into the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experiments made by Prof. S. P. Langley on Mount Whitney, California, indicate that if there were no particles in suspension in the outer air the sun would appear distinctly bluish, instead of white or yellowish as it does under actual conditions. Salt can always be detected in air near the seashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Atmospheric Pressure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Atmospheric pressure varies somewhat from day to day and from hour to hour, but is about 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level. The higher one ascends, the less the pressure. The total weight of the entire atmosphere is about one-millionth of that of the earth. At great heights the atmosphere becomes more and more attenuated. Calculations made from meteors suggest a very thin atmosphere up to two hundred miles from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Occasionally the fumes from a great public utility plant will be borne down upon homes in the vicinity so heavily as to cause headaches and illnesses of other kinds. While high winds are usually beneficial, they are not always so. It depends upon where the air comes from and what it blows over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air liquefies at 220 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit), at a pressure of thirty-nine atmospheres. When liquid air is exposed in a glass vessel it absorbs heat rapidly from surrounding objects, and boils actively until it is entirely evaporated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Liquid air may be frozen to a clear, transparent solid by surrounding it with liquid oxygen and then forcing the evaporation by means of an air pump. Liquid air is used for blasting in tunnels' and mines where the presence of the irrespirable products of combustion is objectionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The temperature of the air depends upon the amount of sunshine it is getting, and also upon where it is coming from. Wind from the south on a cloudy day may be much warmer than wind from the north on a sunshiny one. When it is warm, humid air feels warmer than dry air at the same temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Little is known about atmospheric electricity, but the subject is being intensively studied in observatories specially built and equipped for the purpose. One such has just been completed at Tucson, Arizona. There are others in Samoa, Peru, and West Australia. In calm wwather the atmosphere is always positively electrified with respect to the earth. The operation of a thunder shower is that of a great generator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the radio engineers profess to believe that in the air that envelops the earth all the words that human beings have ever spoken are still reverberating and that some time it may be possible to gather and select and reproduce them. This thing ’which the engineers foresee is impossible and will never come. In its place will be what we Christians designate as the resurrection. They think science will do some such great thing. We know that the Lord will do the much greater thing, and that it is nigh, even at the door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE municipally owned lighting plant of Columbus, Ohio, lights its 400-candle-power street lamps at a cost of $4.94 each, per year. In the nearby cities of Toledo and Cincinnati, where it is necessary for the cities to buy from the Power Trust, the same lamps cost the taxpayers $55 and $60 each, per year. This is only eleven or twelve times as much; but when you consider the thousands of lamps that are burning in each city, and the thousands of cities, you will know why there are millions of dollars available to put in the newspaper offices and in the political offices only such persons as will not make it uncomfortable for the Power Trust. Harding's administration was well oiled; Hoover’s seems to be short-circuited. As the candidate of the Power Trust he is delivering the goods as ’well as could be expected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Thrilling Story of the Late War, Told in the Language of the Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Copyright, 1930, by Daniel E. Morgan</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">WAR AT HOME</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">AR, like the great black plague, reached America. Even while the voters of the nation were campaigning to reelect President Wilson because “he kept us out of war”, the commercial and financial giants of New York, through Myron T. Herrick, late ambassador to France, were negotiating with France; and Messrs. Bacon and Sharpe, speaking for the house of Morgan, had guaranteed France that if she would stay in the war they would put America into it on the side of the Allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How easily this was done has all been explained many times. All that was necessary was to get together a dozen men high up in the newspaper world. Working under the direction of the great banking houses that control all business, they selected the 125 newspapers that control public opinion on the Western continent and tell the people in advance what they may think on any question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By a careful process of elimination the list of 125 papers was cut down to 25; and when these began to churn for war it was a foregone conclusion that the country would get behind the Morgan concern and make its promises good, and it did. It might be added that the editors of these twenty-five papers work for wages, and they get no wages unless they write as they are bid, and their employers, or their bankers, dictate how they shall write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How very, very easy it is for men of great wealth, and with no god except the dollar, to deceive and lead astray a nation of a hundred million souls’ A few signatures to contracts, a few peremptory orders, and the presses begin to whir, and thereafter propaganda does its work; and the people (poor sheep!) will say anything or do anything their bosses wish them to do. The politicians and ecclesiastics are mere pawns in the game, and the Devil is the master of it all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Training in Machine Gunnery</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly after the United States 'declared war the battleships were called in from the South, the marines were transferred to shore and at Quantico, Virginia, received intense training in machine gunnery. This training was so thorough that any of the men could take a machine gun apart and put it together again blindfolded, without the misplacement of a single screw. The major in charge was so confident of the competence of his men that he deliberately walked under a barrage of their machine gunfire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While at Quantico I was granted a leave of absence, in which I visited my “girl in blue”. On this trip I was one of a considerable group that staged a party in the great Pennsylvania railroad station in New York city. We did not then know that this was to be our last meeting era we left for the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within the next two years it was my painful duty to write to the wives and mothers of practically all the men in that group, to tell them when, where, and how those boys met their death. Out of some 250 men in my detachment who passed through all the battles that I passed through, I know of but one man besides myself who returned to America unscathed. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Military officers and war correspondents refer light-heartedly to machine gunners as members of the “Suicide Squad’’. The name is well chosen, but a personal knowledge of the sufferings of these men, and of the sorrows which their deaths caused, to loved ones on this side of the sea, makes one hate the diabolical system that could force young men into the jaws of such a horrible trap.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Off for Europe</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Early in December, 1917, we boarded the transport De Kalb, formerly the Prince Eitel Frederick, contact with shore was cut off, and we swung out for* our destination, St. Nazaire, France, at the mouth of the River Loire. It took fourteen days to negotiate the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was much excitement on the first day out at sea. Long into the end of the day the boys gathered for entertainment, singing the songs that were popular at that time. Most of the boys who sang the songs we then enjoyed were blown to pieces in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the side of the ship where I was placed there was a canteen where one could buy crackers and candies, but there were so many men on</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">B51</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">taz </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">552 </span><span class="font7">board that it was 'difficult to get served. However, there were rnen lining up at the canteen and getting the tidbits, and reselling them to us at high prices. We were glad to get them, no matter what we had to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a given time the &quot;pipe down” signal was given, which meant that every one must retire for the evening. When I came to retire I discovered that there w*as not a spare inch anywhere on the ship where I could rest my weary bones. I spent my first night sitting on a ladder, and was glad to get that space. Thereafter I teamed up with another lad, and when the time came for piping down he would contrive to fill up the space for the two of us until I could get to him. We slept on the hard deck, using as mattresses the life preservers which we were all obliged to w<sup>r</sup>ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I remember one night as I made my rounds as a corporal of the guard, I found one of the boys in distress. I suggested a remedy. He said if his mother were there she could fix him up all right. All I could say to him was, “My boy, you are a soldier now: you are going off to the war; you can not depend on mother now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Cry of “Submarines!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Christmas Day, which we held on December 27, we &quot;were all lined up w<sup>T</sup>ith our mess gear, ready to enjoy the turkey dinner supplied on the ship, when all of a sudden, just about noon, the sirens began to sound, the five-inch guns began to shoot, and we heard the cry, “Submarines I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the time being we forgot all about our Christmas dinner. Mess gear, knives, forks, turkey, and all the other good things, vrere scattered everywhere and wre all ran for our life belts and life preservers. The gun crews fired on any and every object that seemed to them like a periscope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While this was going on the destroyers that convoyed the fleet of transports ran across the path of the transports, back and forth, and behind the transports, back and forth, and parallel to them, back and forth, with almost unimaginable speed. The Devil has certainly built up his war machine to wonderful efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the periscope of a submarine was sighted, a destroyer dashed directly at it. The submarine, trying to escape, passed very near the stern of our vessel, from which point it ’dropped out of .sight, followed by a depth bomb from one of the destroyers. We could not be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sure that the submarine was destroyed, but the appearance of oil upon the surface of the water afterward was taken as evidence that such was the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Toward sundown of that day we sighted Belle Isle, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">terra firma</span><span class="font7"> never looked much better to us all than it did on that occasion. We arrived in St. Nazaire the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In La Belle France</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a strange sight, the next morning, for us to see the little boys and girls of St. Nazaire running up and down on the piers, in their wooden shoes. It sounded like a group of carpenters putting up a wooden structure. These little folks had been taught to say, “Welcome, Americans.” Some sold chocolate, and went up and down the streets crying, “Chocolate; big one!” which was all the English they knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On New Year’s Eve we entrained for a little village near Chaumont, about 160 miles east by southeast from Paris. This meant a journey across France from the extreme west to nearly the extreme east. The trip was made by most of the boys in box cars such as are used for transporting horses, but there were a few third-class coaches in the train, and, by good fortune, I was assigned to one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our Pullman accommodations, on the way to Chaumont, were as follows: There were ten of us to the one compartment, the compartment consisting merely of tw<sup>T</sup>o seeds facing each other, with room on each seat for five men. Matters went very well the first day, but after the first night the desperate need of sleep overtook us. We finally solved the problem by having two of the men lie down on the floor between the seats. Then we took our rifles and laid them across from one seat to the other and put our blankets on top of them, and on that rude bed slept the sleep of the just.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Getting Ready for the Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we arrived at our destination, a little village near Chaumont, called Germanvalliers, we stepped out into snow ankle-deep, and marched several miles to our billets. Some of these were in with the cows. I was again fortunate in being billeted in a house. The quarters assigned vrere what was at one .time a bridal chamber, with a bed fitting into the wall. With bags filled with straw obtained from the peasants it made a comfortable place in which to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our training in France consisted of forced marches, being out in the cold hardening ourselves, and learning to operate machine guns under difficulty. For some reason, and to our dismay, our training at this place was not with the light-weight Lewis guns with which we had received our training at Quantico, but with an ancient model, a Hotchkiss machine gun, weighing perhaps three times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was with these latter clumsy guns that we finally went into battle, and it was this terrible mistake that surely led to the loss of many of our men through exhaustion. Perhaps to the officers this did not look like a mistake; but it looked like a mistake to us men, because the heavy guns were intended for transport by mules, and for defensive warfare, whereas our campaign was to become one of offensive warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we reached the lines, the mules were taken away, and we had to carry ammunition, guns, knapsacks, blankets, shoes, and canteens and march into the battle area. The weight of the tripod of the Hotchkiss gun was about forty-eight pounds, and of the gun itself about the same. These heavy guns we subsequently found a great burden at the front, and never knew why our efficient little Lewis guns had been taken from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Possibly this was brought about by some one of the jealous quarrels among generals, which are a common feature of military activities. It is well known that military men are as jealous of one another as artists, musicians, sculptors, or women are generally supposed to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Belated Gifts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was some months after the holidays that the Christmas gifts started to arrive. After the day’s drill we gathered into groups, feasting on the good things sent to us from across the sea. The packages were many. In them, were fruit cakes, chewing gum, candy, cigars, cigarettes, tobacco, and pipes. There were socks, wristlets, gloves, headgear, woolen helmets, and every other gift that would be useful to men about to enter a tragic war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the gifts that I received was a carton of cigarettes. I did not like the brand. However, they were from my “girl in blue’', so I smoked them anyway. There are a good many cigarettes in a cartoon, and by the time I had finished the last one I came to like them very well. This brand and I became the best of friends; but we had to part, because nowhere in France, so far as I knew, could I obtain another package, and the United States of America was three thousand miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dear friend at Washington, D.C., presented me with a subscription for a Washington daily. Every mail that reached our outfit had in it some of these papers. It was really a feast, and enjoyed by many of the boys, in addition to myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. At evening time many of. us gathered at the village cafe, to wine and dine. We sang songs of love and of war. We were boys, full of hope and joy. Little did we suspect how filled with sorrow and tears were the days that were but just a little ahead of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I enjoyed the company of the village mayor, in whose barn I was billeted. He had a son Andreu and a daughter Suzanne. We sat behind the stove and talked and talked. I could not understand French, and they could not understand English. A strange conversation was ours. We spoke in the ancient language of signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At length we received orders to move. Our boyhood dreams had come true. We were now about to depart for the trenches. After being kissed by the mayor, his son and daughter bidding us adieu, with the tears streaming down their faces, we marched out of the village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">My First Night tn Ike Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we finally reached the trench section, only the officers knew that portion to which we were assigned. As a sergeant, I knew nothing about it. 'With a lieutenant in the lead I walked on the railroad track towards No Man’s Land. It was our first night out, and raining very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We finally saw at a distance ahead of us the silhouettes of men walking toward us. Our procession halted. We discovered that we were lost. The lieutenant went back to the rear, perhaps for orders, and I stood there with a corporal. We crouched on our knees. The forms kept coming closer. It then dawned upon us that, not knowing our exact location, we had walked right out into No Man’s Land. I called out, “Halt! who is there?” Evidently the men were Germans, and did not understand what I said, because they paid no attention to it, but came sloAvIy on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I drew my automatic from my holster, and at the same time I heard the corporal’s automatic click. He asked me, “Sergeant, shall I shoot?” I did not answer, because I was not certain if it was the enemy. Having no previous instruction from the captain or higher officers I knew not what to do. The forms of the men came closer. I took aim and was about to fire, which would have meant the death of some human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I hesitated, looked behind me, and, seeing that everybody else was gone, I told the corporal that the best thing to do under, the conditions was to retreat, and that we did, double time. I did not wish to he captured, and I did not wish to kill somebody, when I did not know who it was. I now realize that these were German raiders, trying to capture us alive, to take us as prisoners of war, for the information they might gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I ran through the rain along the railroad tracks, and tumbled head over heels into a shell crater. I lay in the crater almost am hour: my breath seemed like a steam engine, it made so much noise. As I lay in the shell hole I imagined every minute that somebody was about to pounce on me with a bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At length, very cautiously, I crept out of the hole, and across other shell craters. At every crack of a gun or other sound I lay quiet for a time. I got into the barbed wire entanglements, and became so enmeshed in them that it took me the best part of an hour to disentangle myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Escaping from the barbed wire I found to my horror that I was in an abandoned cemetery, with the tombstones upside down and the contents of the graves strewn about. This was all in the one night, and all in a heavy downpour of rain. I did not know the whereabouts of the corporal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally I came to a road. I discerned men coming up it, but, being bewildered, I did not know where the lines were or whether these were friends or foes. I crawled behind a wall and waited for them to come near enough so that I could tell who they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They were some of our own boys, and in a short time I was back where we had started. I found all of the boys, including the missing corporal, trying to get some shelter in what were once the beautiful homes of the French, but which were now nothing but piles of rocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus ended my first night in the trenches.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>A Few Notes on Trench Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Much has been written about trench life. One of the most famous books of recent years is merely the narrative of two trench raids. I do not wish to cover old ground, as I have something more important to tell. However, I make a few remarks concerning trench life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At sundown each day, for our evening sport and for our own protection, we had a raid, but not on men this time: it was on rats. Almost every one knows that hordes of rats invade the trenches, and there seems to be no effective way of keeping them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We stretched a wire from one of the pillars of the old raihvay station in which we lived, and covered the top with old grass, making it look like the side of a hill. Under this camouflage we proved our art of shooting rats. Many of the boys could get two out of three, and some of the best shooters could get three out of three; I could usually get three out of three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After they were shot they lay there and rotted, and oh, how they did smell! Down in the dugout, where we slept, it was partly filled with water, so we built our bunk up on the w’all, and many a night I sat there by the candle, shooting rats and watching them fall down into the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the course of several weeks of trench warfare our clothing began to wear out. I wore out the only pair of shoes that I had, and for the best part of two v<sup>r</sup>eeks I waded the trenches in the mud with pieces of burlap as foot coverings. I found a piece of sheepskin, which I sewed to a part of an old bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At two o’clock in the morning of each day it was my duty to wade about a mile through the trenches, to send a report to headquarters. A friend in need is a friend indeed; so, being a sergeant, I commandeered the shoes of a friend, to make the long trip to headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All along the line the sentries challenged, and sometimes the boys, half sleepy, and dreaming about attacks of the enemy, came upon one suddenly, and almost stuck a bayonet into one, not knowing where they were. So I often had to tell the boys that if they did not keep awake it would not be a case of their killing me, but of my killing them. War is war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One morning, on my trip to headquarters, I was caught in a gas raid. I knew that the gas goes downward and spreads over the trenches. It is almost a shame for a soldier to say it, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">this time I had gone without my gas mask, and we carried two of them, an English mask, and a French bulldog mask. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In trying to protect myself I crawled up a tree. Of course I knew that the gas would not come up there, so I waited until some one else came by, and called to him. He climbed up the tree, and, soldier-like, gave me one of his masks, and that v/as the way out of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once a night one of the boys was sent to headquarters to bring- the food for the next day. Of course the food came to the men in the trenches stone-cold, so we took turns going for hire food, so that we could get something hot. We thought this was the real war, but discovered later that trench warfare is a picnic compared to open warfare—real war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE BATTLE OF CHATEAU-THIESRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J N THE latter part of May, 1918, the German J- army was in the midst of its great drive on Paris. Airplanes dropped notes, setting the day when they would be in Paris. Shells from long range guns were actually falling in the streets. One of them blew up a church, killing eighty-five persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this point of time the Second Division, in which I was included, was selected to go to the relief of the French army, retreating before the German drive. We were crowded upon trucks, and, without any possibility of rest, traveled for thirty hours, seventy-two miles, to the scone of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stiff and sore, we reached our destination on the morning of June first, and, without delay, in mid-afternoon, were moved at once into line. This was a great mistake. That very afternoon the Germans renewed their thrust, pushing the French before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we neared the battle area we witnessed the most horrible sights that up to that time had ever greeted our eyes. We saw hundreds of old men, old women and little children carrying in their hands loaves of bread, chickens, rabbits and pieces of bed clothing, or pushing barrows with all of their life’s possessions in them. Some were leading cows; others were pushing baby carriages full of their earthly goods. With tears in their eyes they cried out to us as we passed, “Long live the Americans !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On and on toward the front we went. The villages were now vacated, with all their possessions, exactly as one would leave home<sup>1</sup> on Saturday afternoon, to go shopping. The chickens -were in the yard, the cattle in the field, the horses in the barn, and everything else that goes to make up life in a country village was in its usual place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tired and weary, we disembarked at Meaux, midway between Paris and Chateau-Thierry. As we disembarked from the trucks we began to kill chickens and prepare food in the houses of the people that were journeying back to safety in the rear. Excitement was high. We had killed a few chickens and prepared to roast them when the order came, “Into the lines !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not many days later I walked over to the basket where we left the chickens, and not having any food, took a bite out of a chicken’s leg, uncooked: indeed, we all had to eat the chickens without cooking them or else starve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we got nearer to the front, the French wounded appeared on the scene. The poor Frenchmen, streaming through our lines, cried to us to go back, that we could not possibly stop the oncoming Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We took up our position along the Paris and Metz road, running out to Triangle Farm. There we set up our machine guns, and took our ranges. The enemy could be plainly seen with their machine guns, taking up their positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The record shows that the French officers held a council, with the request that the Americans should drop back, but that the Marine general made the famous response, “Retreat? Hell! We just got here.” I do not like to alter the phraseology of a general, but what he should have said is, “Retreat? Hell! </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">They</span><span class="font7"> just got here.” The general was always back in a bombproof dugout, while the Suicide Squad was out on the firing line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What the History Says</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even after twelve years, I do not like to live over again what happened in the next twentyseven days, and I do it only because intimate friends have been at me for two years to get me to put the story in black and white. No person who was ever out there with the guns likes to think or talk or write about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps the best thing I can do is to let the encyclopedia tell the general outline of what happened, and so I give a brief synopsis of the account in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Americana</span><span class="font7"> at this point, merely adding that I was in the very heart of the battle, from its beginning to its end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘The alert marines, as expert rifle men, calmly set their sights, and aimed with the same precision that they had shown upon the rifle ranges at Paris Island, Mare Island and Quantico. The machine guns also went into action. The accuracy of the rifle fire took heavy toll of the German ranks. The Germans ran to cover, raked by the American fire. The German drive for Paris was stayed by this day’s resistance.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Then followed attacks and short advances, and continued fierce counter-attacks and heavy bombardments that thinned the marine ranks sadly, and forbade either rest or the renewing the stock of rations. Cold rations and sleepless nights, shortage of food and absence of water often, for the terrific barrage killed most of the runners.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Between the thirtieth of May and the eighteenth of June hardly a man renewed his clothes or shoes. In less than a week the German 197th, 237th and 10th divisions were so exhausted that the crack 5th guard division had to be called in, then the 28th had to be called in. Thus one American division, the Second, wore out five German divisions.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>In Belleau Woods</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The survivors of the fight in Belleau Woods never refer to it by any other name than Hell Wood. Even the French government, in recognition of what happened there, changed the name of the woods to Bois-de-la-Brigade Marine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we entered it the Germans were just bringing up their machine guns and artillery, sending over occasional shots as range finders, preparatory to blowing the woods to pieces. The pieces of shrapnel began to fly and had me frightened somewhat, so I sought some protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finding that the shrapnel went right through the ammunition boxes, and part way through the machine guns themselves, when they hit them, we began in alarm to dig grave-like holes in the earth, so that we could let the shrapnel fly over our heads.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Washington, Nov. 20 (U&lt; P.)—Science’s evidence of a missing link between man and monkey are feeble threads, according to Curator Gerrit S. Miller of the United States National Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without rejecting the theory of evolution, or even</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the application of it to man, Miller, in the Smithsonian’s annual report to-day, emphasized that science needs many more fossils to prove anything definite about the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Pithecanthropus,” the so-called Java apeman, and ‘Eoanthropus,” the famed “dawn man” of Piltdown, England, are mere collections of fossils of bone fragment, too incomplete to be regarded with certainty as having pertained to creatures intermediate between man and some kind of ape, according to Miller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most anthropologists have come to accept these two famous relics as definite proof of the presence of the popular “missing link.” Miller says further proof is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Two facts, if no others, must be admitted to stand out from the maze of opinion which we have been trying to follow—namely, that these fossils have furnished an unparalleled stimulus to investigation and that the things most needed now are more fossils and many of them,” Miller’s report said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While waiting these further discoveries we should not hesitate to confess that in place of demonstrable links between man and animals we now possess nothing more than some fossils so fragmentary that they are susceptible of being interpreted as such links or as something else.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Java ‘ ‘ man ’ ’ fossils were found in a river gravel deposit at Trinil, Java, by a Dutch physician, Eugene Dubois, in 1891 and 1892 and include the top of a skull, three teeth and a thigh bone. The skull bone is universally regarded as unlike anything ever found before. Disagreement among the learned scientists on no less than fifteen points of interpretation of it is found, however. The Piltdown man, found later, includes parts of two skulls and most scientists agree they are human, but the experts differ on twenty points of interpretation, it was found.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Nothing Can Stop U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nature’s Medicines </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By H, W. Newcomb (Massachusetts)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">HEN we read in Genesis that man was formed out of the dust of the ground it means si</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font7">ply that the sixteen elements found in the human body are all common to our earth and when these were properly combined the human body was the result of the Creator’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then when God breathed into man’s nostrils the 'breath of life’, or forced the air that surrounded the inanimate body into its lungs, man became a living soul. In other words, this act started the human engine working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outside of the frame work of bones this engine is composed of rubber-like, very elastic spongy material called flesh .and tissue. Its function is that of a pump system by air pressure, with an inside circulation of liquids, blood, etc., the lungs being the pump and the heart the valve that regulates the flow of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then as the first breath was automatically exhaling the chemically changed air a vacuum was created in the lung cavity and as the result of the fourteen-pounds-to-the-square-inch atmospheric pressure that surrounds us, automatically more air was inhaled, which resulted in the breathing process we are familiar with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is possible only because the engine consists of elastic, spongy material, with a vital steam power, and with an ability of vibration, expansion and contraction. This vital elasticity of the tissues is due to lime-sugar combination which is obtained from the food we eat, and not from any drugs, medicines or any hypodermic injection that may be wished upon you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stop the intake of air (the breath of life) from this machine of ours, and death soon results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Life is based on change of matter, in the meaning of physiological chemical transformation, but never on the absurd idea that you must eat protein to build protein. Neither must you swallow the glands of dead animals to build the glands of your own body, as the “medicine mon” of our day would have us believe. Does a cow drink milk to produce milk?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The change of matter takes place, not by replacement of old cells by new ones; but the mineral substances are the building stones of animal and vegetable life, and the replacement is of much smaller quantities than most people think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Metabolism, or the science of change of matter, is a most dangerous doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You can not gain vitality and health by protein as long as your human engine must work against obstructions in the system, such as mucus, toxins, poisons, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">High protein food as a necessity of health, as taught and suggested by medical doctrines, is one of the main and general causes of disease. It produced the most dangerous and destructive habit of gluttony, also the eating of diets that are woefully lacking in several of the mineral substances necessary to build tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The more you feed a sick person, the mora you harm him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">High protein foods act as stimulation for a time because they at once decompose into poison in the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Waste from protein and starchy food (the bulk of most diets) is sticky, while the important gland organs are spongy. You can readily see that when these come in contact with each other our human engine becomes obstructed, with the resultant loss of vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">White corpuscles of the blood are increased in case of disease, and also during digestion in the healthy body. These are derived from high protein foods, which is the logical consequence of eating food of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two important things to remember are the vital necessity of iron in the human blood and also the presence of sugar-stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The problem of blood-building in the human body involves all problems of health and disease, and therefore depends upon your diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human body does not assimilate a single atom of any food substance that is not derived from the vegetable or fruit kingdom. All manufactured food mixtures, when too concentrated, either of the animal or of the vegetable kingdom, do not build blood, but stimulate only. Animal life lives upon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">organic</span><span class="font7"> matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Animal food can not build good blood, because man is by nature a fruit-eater. If you do not believe this, turn to Genesis 1:29, 30 and see how the fruits and herbs were given to mam for meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Albumen is not the most important substance for one’s blood, nor do mineral salts alone build perfect blood. The cardinal standard substance for man’s blood is the highest developed form of carbon hydrate chemically called sugar-stuff, grape or fruit sugar as contained more or less in all ripe fruit and in the next lower state in vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If nitrogen is needed it is assimilated from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of these days people are going to wake up to the fact that Prof. Arnold Ehret was fifty years ahead of his time and that in order to obtain health, under the imperfect conditions that now exist, the principles that he laid down must be followed; not because he wrote them, but because they are in harmony with the principles of maintaining life, as revealed in the inspired Word. Of course we understand that life in its fullest sense will be obtained only under Christ’s kingdom, when man will learn how to come back into harmony with Jehovah and receive the benefit of the vicarious sacrifice of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With life-long habits to combat, along with the opposition of our well-intentioned but misinformed friends, most of us find that it is hard to follow these principles at the present time. In spite of this, if one has the backbone and determination to go through with it, the reward is ’well worth the effort put forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following tables of Nature’s Medicine are based upon Prof. Ehret’s Mucusless Diet Healing System. The A table shorvs Mucusless and Mucus-lean foods from the Bagnar Berg tables, while the B tables on food chemistry are taken from the findings of Wilson and Burner and adapted to the Mucusless diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do not make any radical changes in your diet, but GRADUALLY overbalance it with the foods mentioned to meet your requirements, and the results will be beneficial. It takes from one to three years on a Mucusless diet to renovate and rebuild a body that is broken down as a result of eating wrong foods; so do not expect to be restored to perfect health in a week or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following food tables will be helpful in selecting your diet and are arranged in order of their value:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Russia and. the Vatican</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;jP USSIA stands at the one extreme and the Vatican at the other, with the God-fearing man in between. The Russian Union of Militant Atheists has issued a fiery manifesto declaring that “there will come a time when the Atheistic workers of the entire world will convert the Vatican into a museum”, while the Vatican has appealed to the clergy and congregations of all denominations to ‘join in prayer for Russian Christians’, who, it is claimed, are the victims of relentless persecutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the tenth part of what is claimed in this connection is the truth, then there is no doubt whatever about the persecutions. Russia at present is another France during the French Revolution, and the movement to make the whole country completely godless in five years is now in full swing and bids fair to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up to the end of 1929 about two thousand religious institutions in Russia had gone out of existence since the Soviet administration of the country began, ten years ago; but with the beginning of 1930 a new plan went into effect which has closed a thousand such institutions in six weeks. That the new plan is cruel and unjust goes without saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the beginning of 1930, groups of less than twenty persons of one faith have no rights whatever. The larger associations are deprived of legal existence. Their members are forbidden to assist one another by the giving of any material support. They may not establish any kind of central treasury, or own any property or enter into any kind of contract or enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Church property is nationalized, and when a church is to be liquidated notice to that effect is posted on its doors, and if nobody desires to take over the property within a week, then the executive committee goes ahead and disposes of all the property involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prayer meetings may be held only by permission of the authorities, and at such meetings no religious ceremony of any kind is permitted. All religious associations must register within a year, and those not complying will be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Addressing himself to the Vatican’s efforts to put outside pressure upon the Soviet administration, the metropolitan sergius, chief patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church, recently made the following public statement, which must have made interesting reading at Vatican City:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The pope considers himself the vicar of Christ, but Christ suffered for the oppressed and downtrodden, whereas the pope in his declaration proved himself to be in the same camp with the English landowners and the Franco-Italian ‘moneybags,’ ” the members of the Synod present declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ would not have done this. He would have condemned such a retreat from the real path of Christianity. It is stranger still to hear from the Catholic church accusations that the Soviet government is persecuting non-Catholics, because the whole history of the Catholic church is a continuous chain of persecutions of non-Catholics, including torture and burning at the stake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Judge J. F. Rutherford, President, International Bible Students Association, San Diego, Calif. My dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks for yours of the 31st instant, but kindly permit me to make final comment upon your rather stereotyped and dogmatic reply. I note that you run true to form, practically the same as other theologians. They answer vital questions in the same spirit of cocksureness. It’s not what they actually KNOW, but what they BELIEVE. And what a man believes is never accepted as competent evidence in any court of law. It is what he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">KNOWS</span><span class="font7"> that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unfortunately, you like other clergymen of the evangelical type, will not gracefully accept constructive criticism. They all manifest the same mulish, stubborn devotion to a set of tenets, and they can’t reason outside of their own narrow circle of beliefs. I admit, in view of this, it is impossible to meet men of that mental type on any kind of common or logical ground. You, probably, find this to be true when you endeavor to reason with the hell and brimstone brand of Christian. I had a passage at arms with Dr. Gray of Moody Institute on the hell belief. It was a sort of debate, and he published his and my letter in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moody Monthly.</span><span class="font7"> But we got nowhere. He still believes in hell fire and I do not. So what’s the use ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The orthodox theological state of mind is a singular mental phenomenon, which psychopathologists have noted with interest, for often this state of mind is, more or less, pathological. I heard an interesting lecture on this, not long ago, at the Clinical Congress of the American College of Physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You say in your letter that man’s opinion upon any subject is not worth while unless supported by competent evidence coming from a truthful source. Now let’s analyze that statement. You are a man. Therefore your opinions are human. You are subject to mistakes and errors like other men—unless you flatter yourself by believing that Jehovah whispers confidences in your ear which he doesn’t convey to other men. I note that you express your convictions with all the cocksure dogmatism of a Pope handing 'down a pronunciamento. You speak, as it were, ex-cathedra. And by what authority or right do you do this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certainly your opinions are not infallible! Because. you pick out certain passages of scripture to suit your purpose is no proof that you are producing competent evidence. Another theologian W’ill pick out passages to suit his purpose, and he also will say he has competent evidence. And so it goes. I ask you, candidly, if any intelligent person can take such “evidence” seriously? I am of an inquisitive mind and I don’t swallow opinions or beliefs, hook, bait and sinker, nor am I emotional. I note many of your followers are swayed more by emotion than by calm, critical reasoning. They will say they reason, but what kind of reasoning is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is obvious that any man who thinks his opinions about the bible are infallible and beyond criticism, is placing himself in a RIDICULOUS POSITION. I note that there has been a big split in your organization, indicating that many of your former shining lights do not think that you have produced “competent evidence.” You say, of course, that the devil has influenced them. How do you know that? Is the devil on the job every time any of your adherents disagree with your doctrines ? Bosh!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a real debate I fear you would be completely annihilated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You ignored my question relative to your booklet—“Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” Some of your followers have propounded the same question. You contend that spirit communication is possible and is being carried on. Am army of reputable investigators say NO. Certainly your contention is not “competent evidence” in the case. But you are silent in the face of this vital question. It’s facts, not dogmatic personal beliefs that thinking people wmnt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the world were to take seriously a lot of the teaching you promulgate, I fear it would be back in the dark age of myth and superstition. You say you haven’t time to discuss nonsense. The hell fire preachers talk the same way. Their minds too are closed to criticism, and they say they’ve no time to discuss nonsense against hell fire. They hate to be called on the carpet. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1 challenge you to publish this letter in your Golden Age rvith your answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very respectfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Palmer Blouse, Chicago. Joss A. Westlake P.S. Would you care to debate the subject of “competent evidence” with me in a leading national magazine with a 1,000,000 circulation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Diego, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">April 11th 1930 Mr. John A. Westlake, Palmer House, Chicago, III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yours of April 7th to hand. You challenge me to publish this letter and my reply in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> I am sorry to have to ask </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> to take up the space to do so, but it will be published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You class me with theologians. In this you are wrong. I am not a theologian. I believe that the Bible is God’s Word of Truth, and that it is true, and that it is final upon questions with reference to man, his origin and his destiny. There is no theologian in America that believes that. I will accept any constructive criticism upon anything I say provided it is measured by God’s &quot;Word and not by man’s opinion based upon his mere mental conclusion without proper support. I do not believe in the hell-fire theory, because the Bible disproves it. It is entirely inconsistent with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I adhere to my former statement that man’s opinion upon any subject is not worth while unless supported by competent evidence coming from a truthful source. The only competent evidence concerning man, his origin and his destiny, is found in the Bible. I have no opinion in the matter at all. It is true I am subject to mistakes and errors, but Jehovah is not. All things wit^ Him are perfect. I do not flatter myself to believe that Jehovah whispers confidences in my ear which he does not convey to other men. I do flatter myself upon the fact that I believe that His Word is true, and I am willing to stand by what He says. There is no clergyman in America that has the moral courage to say as much. I am willing to debate questions based upon the Bible with any man who will subscribe to the Bible as being correct, and let it be the final arbiter, and not merely windjam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not pick out certain passages of Scripture to suit my proof. If there is any man who does not take the Bible seriously, then I haven’t any time to discuss matters with him, because Jehovah has said, “The fool hath said there is no God.” Likewise the fool does not accept God’s Word as true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You say that “many of your followers are swayed by emotion.” Permit me to say that I have no followers. I ask no man to follow me. I have never followed any man and never will. I do not think that my opinions of the Bible are infallible, but I do think the Bible is infallible because it is God’s Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You state, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“J.</span><span class="font7"> note there has been a big split in your organization, indicating that many of your former shining lights do not think that you have produced ‘competent evidence’.” Again I state that I have no organization. Jehovah God has an organization on earth and I thank Him that I count myself in as one of that organization. Any man 'who does not believe in the Bible and what it teaches cannot be of that organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You say, “In a real debate I fear you would be completely 'annihilated.” I am perfectly willing to meet the most celebrated theologian in America upon the platform, or by radio, or in a magazine to debate on Bible questions, the Bible being taken as the final authority. I refuse to debate with an atheist or an agnostic. It would be a. waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you were less impressed with your own importance, and more impressed with the fact that Jehovah is the Creator of heaven and earth, that Christ Jesus is His great executive officer, that the Bible is His Word of truth, and that it is the lamp by which the feet of sensible men are guided, you &quot;would be in a better condition. I speak frankly because I know no other way to speak. I speak not my own opinion, but speak according to the Word of the Lord. As stated by one of His faithful servants long ago, “Let God be true though it make all men liars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While I write with positive statements, I write with a full support. I have no desire to be dogmatic. I am not dogmatic in my own opinions, but I do not hesitate to say that I rely exclusively for my conclusions upon God’s Word which is the Bible, and w<sup>T</sup>hich can be read by anyone and understood by anyone who has the spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since you desire to debate “What is Competent Evidence?” in a magazine with a circulation of a million, I accept your challenge and ask you to state the proposition in such form that I can accept it and produce my side. I am, my dear sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very respectfully,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">World Distress • Cause • Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[Address by Judge Rutherford, broadcast </span><span class="font4">April 27, </span><span class="font2">1930, from Oakland, California]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T IS my privilege this morning to consider with you a subject of vital importance. I speak from California, the land of sunshine and flowers. It should be the land of prosperity, contentment and happiness. It suffers much distress, however, like all other parts of the world. Able-bodied men having an honest desire to wmrk wearily drag themselves along the highways in a vain search for work. The tax burden has become so tremendous and the cost of living so high that owners of modest homes have great difficulty to carry the burden and supply their families with bare necessities. And yet doubtless this is the most favored spot on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looking across the continent wm see far greater distress. The official report from Albany discloses the deplorable condition of the poor in the great tenement section of the city of New York. Large estates owned by the few rich contain the miserable buildings that house many of the poor. The rich refusing to make these places habitable, the poor are turned out and have no place to rest their weary heads. Long lines of hungry men and women daily stand and W’ait to be served by the bread of charity because they are unable to find work to earn an honest living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Turn to Washington, where there is much talk and little real work, and practically no effort is made towards relief. From there the official report comes disclosing upwards of three million persons in the great land of America with no possible way of earning a living. Upon these idle men depend more millions of children for clothing and food. The controllers of commerce, unable to see how they can quickly profit by the use of labor of the idle men, hoard their money and make no provision for the poor to earn their daily bread even by the sweat of the brow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In England more than a million and a half are without employment. In Germany, two and one-half millions; while in most of the other countries there is a like proportion of idleness. There is much poverty and distress in Spain, and during the recent severe winter many of the children, in order to keep warm, were compelled to sleep with the swine. In India there is now in progress a revolution, while in China millions are star ring to death. Sickness, trouble, sorrow and death increase the daily burdens laid upon the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fearing some calamity might result to their material wealth the ultrarich form great mergers of capital and centralize their power and try to make themselves believe that they can defy the approaching collapse. The statesmen of the world are in perplexity and distress, the fact of which is emphasized by the many conventions and world conferences held to form leagues and world courts, and to make so-called peace treaties. The religious leaders take their part in the world organization, claiming that the governments are exercising their power by divine right and authority, and they urge the people to give thereto their unstinted support. Since the World War special efforts have been made by the ruling powers to better the conditions, but without avail, and they continue to grow worse. Added to these conditions of discouragement and distress there are millions of disrupted families and homes broken up, and men and women resort to all manner of crime. Truly it is a time of perplexity and distress and woe for mankind, and of this all are fully aware. What is the cause? Is there an adequate remedy? These are questions that now claim the thoughtful consideration of all men who have a desire to see a better state of affairs amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Organizations</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be satisfactory, the answers to these questions must be clear, cogent and convincing and supported by indisputable proof. The mere opinion of man will not do. The true and satisfactory answers thereto are found in the Bible. There was a time when but little of the Bible could be understood by. men, because it was not God’s due time for it to be understood. Now God’s due time has arrived to make it clear, and the Bible can be understood. The physical facts well known to all are brought forward showing the fulfilment of divine prophecy and furnishing the key to the understanding of the Scriptures. Because the Bible is the Word of God and is true I give to you therefrom the answers to the questions concerning both the cause and the complete remedy for the distress of the world. Let us no longer rely upon the theories of men, but take the infallible Word of God, that we may see how relief is coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two great organizations operating</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">which are in part seen by men while the greater portion of those organizations are unseen by human eyes. These are Jehovah’s organization and Satan’s organization, and they are in deadly opposition to each other. His name Satan denotes that he is the opposer of everything that is good and righteous, and therefore opposed to God. The motive of Satan is not only selfish, but desperately wicked. God’s organization is righteous, and the moving cause thereof is unselfishness or pure love. Satan resorts to fraud and deceit and hypocrisy to overreach and mislead the people, that his purposes may be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan is the arch enemy of man. Jehovah God is man’s true Friend. To appreciate the situation the history of the enemy organization must be kept in mind and it must be remembered that long ago God made Lucifer the head of an organization of which the perfect man Adam was the earthly or visible part. Lucifer rebelled against God and led God’s angels and man into wickedness. Then it was that God changed Lucifer’s name to that of Satan and Devil. Satan defied Jehovah and challenged His Word and declared that God could not put a creature on earth who would remain true and stedfast to God and maintain his integrity with Him. Jehovah accepted the challenge and let Satan do his worst and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> the limit. From the time of Eden until now Satan has continued to oppose God and has drawn into his wicked organization by far the greater number of the human race, and this he has accomplished by fraud, deception and hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The commerce of the world is organized and carried on by men for personal profit and selfish purposes. The separate governments of earth are formed and carried on by selfish men for power and influence and adulation. Few of the commercial giants of the world and very few of the statesmen of the world have any knowledge of Satan and of his schemes. They do not know that they are serving Satan. The religions of the world have been organized and practiced by men, and Satan has obtained control thereof. The clergy of Christendom in particular, professing to know and to teach the Bible, should have heeded its instruction and held aloof from the selfish influence of commerce and politics. These men might have rendered good service to the commercial and political elements of the world by telling them the truth concerning God’s Word; but, instead, they have induced the stronger men of earth to believe that their rule is by right granted to them from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A great climax in the affairs of the world has been reached, and such has a direct bearing upon the world distress. Long centuries ago Jehovah foretold through His prophets that He ■would let Satan take his own wicked course without hindrance until God’s due </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font7">e to put him and his organization down. He then foretold that the end of Safaris rule without hindrance would come in 1914 and would be marked by the World War, in which all the leading governments of the earth would be engaged. That war came exactly on time, in fulfilment of prophecy. By His prophets God also foretold the formation of the League of Nations, and that efforts &quot;would be put forth by men to establish a world peace, and that their efforts and confederacy would fail. Then Jesus emphasized what would follow, in these words, recorded in Luke 21: 25, 26: ‘Upon earth there shall be distress of nations, with perplexity; men’s hearts failing them for fear of what they see coming upon the world.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is apparent to all today that fear has taken hold of the commercial giants of the world and induced them to bind themselves together in great mergers; and that fear and distress has laid hold upon the statesmen of the world, causing them to hurry about the formation of leagues and the making of treaties, while at the same time they frantically build the greatest war machine the earth has ever known. All these tilings are in clear fulfilment of the prophetic words of the Lord. Hear now from the Bible the reason therefor at this particular time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the beginning of 1914 there also came a war in heaven, between Christ on one side and Satan and his angels on the other, resulting in the throwing of Satan out of heaven to the earth, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font7">d henceforth he must confine his operations to the earth. He being desperately wicked, we should expect that Satan would cause all the woe and distress possible on earth, and here is what the Lord says will follow: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(C</sup>Woe</span><span class="font7"> to the in-habiters of the earth,, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is meant by the statement here, that Satan knows that he has Hut a short time ? The scriptures in Revelation 16 answer that Satan is hurriedly gathering all his forces for the great battle of Armageddon and that he knows that his time to prepare therefor is short. In that battle he expects to win. He is absolutely certain to lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has issued His decree that He will destroy Satan’s organization completely and not one vestige thereof shall remain after Armageddon. The great issue now before the intelligent creation is: Who is God, who is supreme, and who shall rule the world? Satan has blinded men to the truth and induced the ruling powers of the earth to think that they are going to rule and that they can establish and rule the world forever. But, No, says Jehovah God. The time has come when wicked rule and operation shall end, in order that the people might be released from oppression and that all may know the true and only living God and the way that leads to life and endless happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to cover up his wicked purposes Satan has caused his representatives on the earth to teach the people that there is no such creature in existence as the Devil, Satan, and at the same time has induced the people to believe that Jehovah God is responsible for all the misery, suffering, and distress of humankind. That of course tends to turn the people away from the true God. They must know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah will have the people to be informed of His purposes, that they may have a fair opportunity to take the right side of the great controversy now being waged. Who will inform them? Not the clergymen, because most of them do not believe the Bible and practically all of them are allied with the governments of this world and are seeking the ways of selfish men to establish the world. The arm of Jehovah is not shortened. He has arranged to have the people informed of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has brought into operation the radio that the order-loving people may sit in their homes behind closed doors and receive notice of what is impending. He has caused millions of books to be printed containing the true statement of His Word that the people may together with their own Bibles read and understand without the aid of a paid ministry. To carry on His work Jehovah God has a little band of men and women throughout the land who are wholly devoted to Him. They love God and His truth better than this life. He has commissioned them to do His work, and that work is to carry the message of His Word to the people that they may be informed before the fall of Christendom. To this little company Jehovah says: We are my witnesses; go and tell the people that I am God. I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand, that ye may say to those who will hear, Jehovah is God, and that he has placed earth’s rightful King, his beloved Son, upon his throne, and that his kingdom is at hand.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This little company of men and women earn their daily bread by various methods of honest toil, but they spend their spare hours and their Sundays in going from house to house in obedience to God’s commandments to preach the gospel of His kingdom to the people. At the Bethel home, Brooklyn, there is a part of this little company who make books during the week and carry them to the people in their homes on Sundays to inform them of God’s purposes. God is protecting and blessing their efforts and using them to His praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, Satan would oppose every possible means or effort to get the truth to the people. These faithful witnesses of God expect opposition. They are not going from house to house to obtain converts nor to get money. The small sum they take for the books does not even defray the expense of printing and distribution thereof. This little company of men and women come to you, not for a selfish purpose, but as your friends, and are commissioned by Jehovah God to bring you this message of truth. I bid you to hear their brief speech and then determine whether or not it is of sufficient importance, in the light of present-day world distress, for you to give heed to what that message contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But some will say, Why is this little company and their work opposed by the clergymen ? 'Why are many of them caused to be arrested upon the pretext of violating the peddler’s laws, or the Sunday blue laws?’ The answer to that question is found in John 8:44. The clergymen opposed Jesus when He was on earth and opposed Him because He was preaching the same message of truth. Jesus said that His true followers will be opposed by the same class of men. The words of Jesus concerning the opposers are these: &quot;Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.”—John 8:43-45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you find the clergymen opposing the message of the Lord’s kingdom which this little company is bringing to you, then you may decide from the facts as to whether these clergymen represent Jehovah God, as they claim, or are working in the interest of Satan the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But let me speak a word to those who do oppose, who I hope are listening. This is not a threat, but it is a solemn warning to the police officers and the sheriffs, to the magistrates and the judges of the courts, and particularly to the clergy who use their influence to cause these public officials to interfere with the work of the Lord. The Constitution of the United States guarantees that every man shall have the right to preach the gospel in his own good way without let or hindrance. VChile this little company has the right to demand the privileges guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, there is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">higher power that protects them. Jehovah God has commissioned them and sent them forth, and they must and will obey His commandments at any cost. They may be imprisoned, some of them may be killed, but that will not stop the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah destroyed the government and army of Egypt because these opposed the action and work of His chosen people. Jehovah slew the army of 185,000 before the walls of Jerusalem because that army, and particularly its leaders, opposed God’s people. The Word of the Lord declares that these things that came to pass then were but examples of w’hat He will do in the battle of Armageddon to all those who oppose the onward march of His Word of truth. Therefore I bid you who oppose to take heed to the words of Jehovah God which I opiote from Psalm 2: 6,10-12 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font7">: T have installed my King on my holy mountain. Now therefore, ye rulers of earth, show your prudence; be admonished, ye judges of the earth; serve Jehovah with reverence; obey the Son, the King, lest ye</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">perish by the way/ Each one who opposes the onward march of God’s message now must take the responsibility upon his own head. If you do not want to hear the message when it is brought to you, let these faithful witnesses pass on and they will not annoy you. Bear in mind that they are God’s anointed witnesses, and as to their standing in Jehovah’s eyes I quote His words in Psalm 105:15: &quot;Touch not mine anointed, and do my witnesses no harm.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To you who are of the army of the Lord and who now stand by, I speak these words of the prophet for your encouragement. Go and tell the people of God’s purpose and declare His W'ork among the people; sing forth the praises of His name, because you are the anointed feet of Him upon the nations of earth, and of and concerning you it is written, if you continue faithful to the Lord: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!”—* Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is but one remedy for the world distress, and that remedy is adequate and complete. That remedy is the kingdom of God by and under His Christ. The reign of Christ Jesus has begun, which was first marked by the World War, famine, and pestilence, and now by world distress. The next great act will be the complete destruction of Satan’s organization in the battle of Armageddon. God by His Prophet Jeremiah has declared that in that battle there will be so many slain that others will not bury them. It will be a time of destruction such as the earth has never known, it will completely convince all that Jehovah is the Supreme One of the universe, and that His power is without limitation,, and that He is the Friend of the people to relieve them in due time. The Lord will rid the earth of the oppressing force that the orderloving people may have a chance to turn to him and to receive instruction, and to learn the way of life when and where there is no fraud and deception to mislead them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next great act of Jehovah God by His executive officer, who is earth’s rightful Ruler, will be to establish order and everlasting peace upon the earth. Upon His shoulder the government shall rest, and of the peace thereof there shall be no end. Always invisible to the sight of men, henceforth Christ will have on earth a little company of visible administrators of governmental affairs. The names of a number of these men are set forth in Hebrews the eleventh chapter, among whom will be Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Moses and others, who will soon be brought back to earth as perfect men. And what a blessed government that will be 1 No more graft will be possible; no more oppressive, fraudulent schemes of taxation enforced; no more fraudulent operations to induce the people to give up their hard-earned money to satisfy the greed of those who produce nothing; no more oppressive, harsh and cruel armies and navies to force young men into the slaughter pens; and no more hypocritical clergymen to preach these young men into untimely graves. No more exalting of the rich and influential and giving of special favors to the few. It will be a time and government when poor and rich shall stand equal before the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning that blessed kingdom and its operations it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) These princes mentioned are the visible administrators on earth, and the Lord and all His representatives will rule in righteousness and for the benefit of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today the people have difficulty in learning the truth, because of the fraud and deception practiced upon them by the enemy and his agencies. Immediately following Armageddon, it is declared in Revelation 20: 3, Satan shall be put out of the way in order that he may deceive the nations and peoples no more during the righteous reign of Christ and the blessings that shall accompany it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The issue, 'Who is God? and who shall rule the world? is now squarely drawn. The people are now being informed in order that they may take their stand on the side of Satan or put themselves under the protection of Jehovah God. Why should you longer halt between two opinions? If you believe that the Bible is untrue, as the clergymen tell you, and that imperfect men can straighten out and stabilize the affairs of the world, do away with distress, and bring relief and comfort to mankind, then take your stand on that side of the false prophets and fall at Armageddon. If you believe that Jehovah is the true God and that the Bible is His Word of truth, then enlighten yourselves concerning the teaching of the Bible and take your stand on the side of God and, as He has promised, you may be hid and protected and pass through Armageddon unscathed and be amongst the first to receive the blessings of the righteous reign of Christ. The only mission and purpose of the little company that brings to you the message is to serve notice and inform you, that you may choose this day whom you will serve. The notice once given, the responsibility is off their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All must now see that human agencies cannot relieve the people of their distress. The Bible tells of the complete remedy. Its truths are now being unfolded, and as the Lord has said through His prophet, these truths shall ‘sweep away the great refuge of lies’ by which the people have so long been misled and misruled. The order-loving people of the world desire to know what is right, that they may do right and prosper and be happy. In Isaiah God caused the record to express the sentiments of the great multitude of honest men and women, and from which I quote: “With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.”—Isa. 26: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this brief address I have called your attention to many important truths that appear in the Bible. Time would not permit me here to quote or even cite the texts in support thereof. The little company of men and women whom I have mentioned as calling upon you in your homes will exhibit to you a number of books devoted exclusively to these great and burning truths of the Bible. The books are prepared in simple form, not giving utterance to the wisdom of man, but calling attention to the wisdom of God and showing you where to find in His Word the complete proof thereof. They are a great treasure to any one possessing them, because they point out clearly the reason for the distress and woes of humankind and disclose to the clear understanding of those who seek the truth the complete remedy therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah now causes notice to be served upon the people of what He shortly purposes to do. His kingdom is already under way. Those who take their stand on His side, remain stedfast and maintain their integrity, will receive the gift of everlasting life through Jesus Christ the Redeemer and Ruler of the world. The time has come to vindicate the word and name of Jehovah God, and this He will completely do with the destruction of all opposition at Armageddon. We are now in the beginning of the time spoken of in the Scriptures as “that day”. When the people are released from oppression God’s prophet represents them as saying concerning the kingdom, these words: “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us;- this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”—Isa. 25: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now I bid you all open your minds to an understanding of the Word of God; learn that Jehovah is the true God and Friend of suffering humanity; submit yourselves to Him and be obedient to His commandments and receive at His gracious hand the blessings of everlasting peace and prosperity, contentment and joy, complete liberty and happiness, and the favor of everlasting life. ' Jehovah is the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Oakland Hook-up</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font7">EARLY every Sunday morning Judge Rutherford speaks over thirty-three radio stations in a hook-up covering all the northern and eastern part of the United States, reaching down to Charlotte, N. C., in the south, and to Lincoln, Nebr., in the west. The great bulk of the people of the United States and Canada are reached by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Periodically, however, the International Bible Students Association, of which Judge Rutherford is president, makes a special effort to reach still farther north and south and east and west. Such was the case when Judge Rutherford spoke over 107 stations, August 5, 1928, much the greatest radio hook-up in history. Another great hook-up was the initial one in Toronto, 53 stations; a later one was from Albany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The latest of the extra large hook-ups carried Judge Rutherford’s address on World Distress: Cause; Remedy (printed in full in this issue, immediately preceding this report of its reception). It went out from Oakland, Calif., and was received by stations at Bangor, Me.; Boston, Mass.; Charlotte, N. C.; Chicago, Ill.; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Evansville, Indiana; Fort Wayne, Indiana;Hamilton,Ont.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Hopkinsville, Ky.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Lincoln, Nebr.; Muscatine, Iowa; New York, N. Y.; Norfolk, Va.; Paterson, N. J.; Petersburg, Va.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; Providence, R. I.; Raleigh, N. C.; St. Joseph, Mo.; St. Louis, Mo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Schenectady, N. Y.; Scranton, Pa.; Shreveport, La.; Sioux Falls, S. Dak.; Syracuse, N. Y.; Washington, D. C.; &quot;Wheeling, W. Va.; Youngstown, Ohio; Bellingham, Wash.; Fresno, Calif.; Hollywood, Calif.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Medford, Oreg.; Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Oreg.; Reno, Nev.; San Diego, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; Spokane, Wash.;Victoria, B. C.;Miami Beach, Fla.; Ogden, Utah; and Denver and Colorado Springs, Colo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without any attem.pt to arrange the reception reports geographically we give extracts from a few of the many letters and telegrams received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Los Angeles, Calif., said: “The radio sermon this morning was remarkable. You have evidently boiled down much that the other writers have made too abstruse for the layman to absorb. I believe that much of our country’s condition now is due to the fact that very, very few people are able to make head or tail of the Bible in the brief time they have for its study; therefore they turn to the world.” M.E.W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salem, Va.: “Am happy to know that God has a people in the world who are not afraid to tell the truth about the wrongful injustice in the world today; also glad to hear you say that Jesus Christ’s reign is about to take place. I have been trying to get my husband to join church for years and have not succeeded, and now cannot even get him to go to church; though he seems very anxious to listen to the Watch Tower lectures—especially yours.” Mrs. H.S.G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scranton, Pa: “My heart is too full to say ■what I would, but I must give expression to some of the joy and peace you brought to it this morning. It was beyond words inspiring, to hear the dignified, straightforward, fearless and thoroughly sincere words in which you gave the glorious message of Jehovah to the people. From the 'depths of my heart I thank the Lord that He has raised up such a man as you at the present time. I hope and pray for continuance of His blessing upon you.&quot; C. J.W., Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Greensboro, N. C.: “Lecture truly the best yet. People heard it everywhere. As handbills were distributed announcing it we found widespread interest in the Sunday chain program from WBBR, but this intensified it. Raleigh station is giving splendid service. Message was thrilling. Program came in fine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shreveport, La.: “Greatest witness ever given in Shreveport. What a privilege to have part in this! Reception was perfect. All join in praise to our heavenly Father for such a mighty witness to His name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Queen City, Tex.: “Address and all program received clearly. We walked several miles over a trail to hear it, and it was greatly enjoved by all.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chisago City, Minn.: “Wonderful message came through absolutely perfect. It is certainly refreshing to pick up a message like the one this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Woodville, Wis.: “Program came clearly over a cheap set. We anxiously await your decision to add this station to chain. &quot;We colporteurs need the help. This feature every Sunday would be a great help in opening the way for placing the books.” Three Pioneer Colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miami Beach, Fla.: “Heard as plainly as though in local studio. Lecture itself seemed to be God-given and -directed in its subject matter. We seemed to be sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. As soon as lecture was over we went out and placed more books than ever before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Encrucijada, Cuba: “Two of us heard here distinctly. The ■words are as a picture before rue. Good words and a good work. We were served by WIOD, Miami Beach, Fla.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quincy, Mass.: “Good reception of message and greatly rejoice in the manner we are led.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chickasha, Okla.: “The lecture came in clear as a bell; no static at all; your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated; this lecture the best one yet; thousands here are hearing your lectures.” Mrs. J.C., Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brownsville, Pa.: “Your voice, laden with message of praise and instruction to rulers burned my heart with joy.” E.D.O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Clinton, N. C.: “Although I am just a girl of fourteen I enjoy the lectures that come over the radio, very much. I listen in every Sunday, nearly, and my mother and father would not miss it for pay; they think it is grand. I especially enjoyed the program today. It was wonderful, so plain and clear. We had several friends from the country to hear it that otherwise could not. My father and mother distribute books that are put out by the Bible Students as often as they can. They go out on Sunday morning and place books until lunch. I think it is a fine work; I suppose I will be doing it when I get older.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">State’s Prison, Halifax, N. C.: “Kindly mail me your literature on last Sunday’s lecture and any other pamphlets you may have for distribution. I am an inmate of the prison here; I enjoy the talks and lectures, and look forward to the weekly programs with pleasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mound, Minn.: “About forty of us gathered here to listen to Judge Rutherford. Words cannot express our appreciation for the good message.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Minneapolis, Minn.: “Judge Rutherford spoke clearly and his words were filled with feeling and love. It was very encouraging to us all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lincoln, Nebr.: “Just a line to express my appreciation of the lecture. Going from house to house I met an old man about eighty years old, all crippled, from age, I guess. He had a small crystal set.-He told me he stayed home while his wife went to church. He tuned in to see if he could get anything so early in the morning and got your message over KFAB. He told me he had been to all kinds of big lectures, and had heard all kinds over the radio, but that never, never had he heard such a fine thing in his life. He said he had been looking for some one to come along with the books, because Judge Rutherford had said they would. He was so happy over it all and wanted to know when you would ever speak again.” I.M.M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rocklin, Calif.: “Five of us just heard your wonderful lecture. It came in just fine. We felt as if we could almost see your face. Our hearts are thrilled with joy because the people shall now learn that Jehovah is God and a real friend to the people.” G.G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Valleyford, Wash.: “I had the pleasure of listening to your wonderful address on the truth. It was the finest lecture I have ever heard.” S.E.J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Powell River, B. C.: “Program came through from KOMO Seattle. Voice clear and strong; just a little static. We do appreciate your clearcut delivery, and would say that the most notable quality, next to the message itself, to the public, would be the great contrast between the humble, sincere, authoritative delivery of a Christian’s voice, and the bombastic, sanctimonious, affected delivery of the clerical D.D. The thinking public must sense this.” A.A.B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Loyalton, Calif.: “It was a blessing to hear your voice again, and we were very much refreshed as we stood by for a word from you. We would not give flattering titles, dear brother, but we do love you and when the fiery darts come your way suffer with you as one. We are 100-percent for Jehovah. The power was shut off for some time before you began speaking, but the Lord overruled and just at the stroke of 10 a. m. the lights came on, so wm could hear you. Static has been very bad for a week now and most radios are yet silent, but we got every word very distinctly.” Mrs. R.I.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Calais, Me.: “Your sweet message of truth came to us here in Calais, this morning, clear as a bell, and thrilled our hearts.” M.L.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pittsburg, Kans.: “I wish to express my appreciation, in these few lines, for the lecture or sermon broadcast April 27 over the radio from Oakland, Calif., on World Distress: Cause; Remedy. The lesson taught does so much good. We feel the need of thousands more such men as yourself that can demonstrate courage enough to tell the world what it is suffering from.” Mrs. II.H.J. .</span></p>

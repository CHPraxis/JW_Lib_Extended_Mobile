Y., Wednesday, July 9, 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 282</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>a</sup>TTie Flower of the Field ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T T IS rather noteworthy that in His Word God lias said so little about the stars and about the flowers. They have not been left unmentioned, but one gets the impression that He sees no reason to mention the glories and beauties of the night and of the day that are, in their season, everywhere apparent in creation. God does not boast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Solomon spoke of the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley, and our Lord invited us to “consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these'<sup>5</sup>; yet these expressions are more remarkable for what is left unsaid than for what is said. The psalmist and other Biblical writers mention the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord must love them. The kinds run into the thousands, and the varieties are numberless. Billions of blossoms every year are entirely unseen by human eyes, but if the angels before the flood could and did admire the flower of the human creation, there is little doubt that they also enjoy the quiet little faces on stalks that are always smiling up at them in the sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Europe is the world’s flower garden. Even in the poorest communities the cottages are everywhere surrounded with brilliant flowers, lending a grace and charm to the countryside that does much to offset the poverty which is by no means confined to that continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In America it is not common for business houses to have window boxes of well-kept flowers; it is not at all uncommon in Europe. Most European homes have gardens, but they are inclosed, in the rear, and constitute the private outdoor home of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The flower fields of Holland are of world-wide fame. The color schemes of these fields are designed by artists. Italian gardens devote most attention to ivy and evergreens, best calculated to form beautiful backgrounds for the statuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Language of Flowers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In every country and in every age lovers have been bestowing flowers as gifts, and it is not to be wondered at that a language of flowers has grown up. The Romans developed a floral speech, revived to some extent in the days of chivalry, but almost lost in our prosaic, mercenary days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet every summer the daisy tells some girl whether “he loves me: he loves me not”. The forget-me-not and the pansy speak of constancy and thoughtfulness. The buttercup under the chin shows the fondness for butter. The sunflower warns of false riches, the hollyhock speaks of ambition, the lady-slipper of beauty mingled with caprice, and the larkspur of fancy in its flight. The lily commands and the violet shrinks. There was a time when every bud and spray in a bouquet meant something to a young woman’s heart, but today neither she nor the young man knows what it is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Borneo a flower has been discovered which grows to be thirty-five inches in diameter. Its bud is often as large as a man’s head. Not sure if Mussolini wears one of these in his buttonhole, but he should. He takes the biscuit, and is entitled to the bouquet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to national flowers, Japan’s is the chrysanthemum, Mexico’s the prickly pear, Spain’s the pomegranate, Germany’s the cornflower, Wales’ the leek, Egypt’s and India’s the lotus. Some of the other national flowers are incorporated in the following jingle; which is not so bad, in view of the fact that America has not yet laid claim to one:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;France has the fleur-de-lis;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">England has the rose;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everybody knows where the shamrock grows, Scotland has the thistle, Growing on the hill;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the emblem of America is the one-dollar bill. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pansy, the poppy and the goldenrod have each, been proposed as the national flower emblem of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Joys of Gardening</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man who has plenty of money and is able to hire landscape architects and professional gardeners to do his work can never know as much of the joys of gardening as a-man who takes a rough-looking lot and gradually, in his spare time, tranforms it into a thing of beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It-takes a lot of time to keep up a garden, and the work is never finished. Probably one reason the Lord said so little about it in His Word is that He knows that a man is liable to do next to nothing in spreading the gospel of the Kingdom if his energies are employed in. beautifying a piece of real estate. A man cannot do everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A gardener’s education is never finished. If he is progressive something new comes up.every season. The Brooklyn ■ Botanic Gardens exchange seeds every year with 140 botanic gardens scattered all the way from Java to Norway. New plants are constantly being added to America’s flora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Old plants are being reinvigorated, petals painted new tints, blooming seasons lengthened. 'Methods of .attacking the enemies and the diseases of plants are being constantly improved. Every winter the gardener sees how next spring he will be able to make changes in his plans which will improve hi s place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are fashions in flowers as in dress. Some of the flowers that were popular a generation ago are now seldom, seen. A man who has gardening for a hobby can easily become a specialist in some line. It is notable that the growing of flowers as a business attracts children and keeps them at home. Many floral businesses are handed down from father to son, from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gardeners are advised to keep a log, so that lessons may be remembered and errors not be repeated. A New York switchman attracted much favorable attention to himself by making his switchman’s shanty the center of a little garden of surpassing beauty. He combined work with play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An elderly woman, living high up in one of New York’s storied apartments, wrote to the press asking them to thank the householders who in the little yards below had made scenes of beauty which reminded her of her girlhood days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Some Garden Hints</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The objective of the gardener is the same as that of the home-maker: to make the garden, a restful place, a place where one will feel at ease, and to which he will wish to resort for rest and peace and quiet. There are homes which convey that impression inside and outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Plants need rest, the same as humans. If a plant that has been doing well seems to lag it may need only a period of rest in a. dry, cool collar. There, in time, it will begin to put out green shoots, and is then ready for a thorough watering and a place in the sun. Fertilizer may be given to it later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bo not be too vigorous with the pruning shears if you do not know just what you are about. Many a good plant has been set back unduly by too much ambition to cut and trim. It is often cheaper to buy plants than to try to make and operate a hotbed. However, if your place is large enough, there are some advantages in having one’s own hotbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bell-shaped glass covers, one for each plant, have been used in gardens in England and are considered a success. Separate plants can be given special care: the bells are easily lifted and carried about and no permanent structure ’ is needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' It is not true that moonlight injures plants. When the moon shines brilliantly it indicates a clear night and lower temperature. It is the cold that sets back the plants. Gardens should be often cultivated; not often watered. Let nature do the watering. Cultivate after every rain, before the soil gets baked hard..</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many perennials give a second crop of flowers. 'When Pyrethrum blossoms fade, cut the plant back to about five inches from the ground, dig in a good handful of steamed bonemeal, water well and mulch to keep the soil cool, and a second bloom will be the reward. The same thing can be done with delphinium, hollyhocks and iceland poppies, but not with peonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Back Toward Eden</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man is gradually turning the earth back toward Eden, making it all into a garden. If there were no dry or bare spots in the world there' would be very little dust. The most attractive towns are those that have the grassiest lawns, and they are the cleanest because easiest to keep clean. It is impossible to have a clean home next to a dusty road that is heavily traveled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There ought to bo some water in every garden, It need not be an expensive pool or marble fountain. It may be a small pool, a sunken barrel, or merely a shallow dish sunk in the lawn. If it is kept filled with fresh water it will attract plenty of feathered visitors from the skies. And birds are good friends of the garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the back lot is very, very small it is surprising -what may be grown on a rack: strawberries, carrots, onions, spinach, radishes, etc., in tiers one above another. If the plot is of fair size one new and different plant should be tried each year; and a corner should be devoted to the sweet herbs, more and more used in the culinary art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People who can afford it may now have their gardens lighted by steel-blue light screened through stippled lenses, with individual lenses for special rose bushes and separate floral groups, with amber spot rights here and there that make the garden a veritable fairyland, even more charming at night than in the day. Hybridization is producing marvels of plant beauty impossible to describe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Living Plants in the Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few living plants in the home are a great attraction and require but a moment of time. Five minutes of time will care for a window box, and a bowl of ivy will not require more than five minutes a week. An attractive window box can be coaxed into existence by merely planting some grapefruit seeds in a box filled with good soil. The box must be kept by a southern or eastern window.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some busy people, in selecting plants for their homes, choose only those which will live in water. In some localities soil is not so easy to procure; but water can always be had. Many plants die indoors because they do not have enough fresh air. They thrive best in a temperature of not more than 70 degrees by day nor less than 55 degrees at night. A window box may be stood near a window that has inserted in it one of the standard ventilators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To grow a pineapple as a house plant select &amp;&nbsp;sound fruit with the green top still attached. Remove the top and plant in a sandy soil in a three-inch or four-inch pot. For a few days the soil should be kept wet and the box be stood in partial shade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A house fern is benefited by being watered once in three months with water containing a little household ammonia. It makes the leaves green and glossy. It is believed that the chief reason soapsuds are beneficial to plants is because of the water in the suds. The soap itself seems hardly to affect the plant one way or the other. The lye in the soap rids the soil of insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one is expecting to be away for several days, the plants can be cared for by arranging them around a water container. The greater the number of plants, and the longer the proposed absence, the larger should be the container. Fill the container to the brim. Bury one end of a large wick in the soil in each pot and drop the other end in the water clear to the bottom. Nature and capillary attraction will do the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The palm house of the botanical gardens at Leningrad is watered by an artificial rainfall which is distributed over the entire interior at one time. The water is forced through the pipes electrically and the flow is controlled by the operation of a single switch. Not many of us would know<sup>7</sup> what to do with that method of watering house plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Care of Cut Flowers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It almost seems a pity to cut flowers from the source of their life, yet there are some plants that seem to be positively benefited by the removal of their blossoms. It is a shame to tear off the flowering boughs of apple trees, and it is a shame to gather many wild flowers and thus denude the fields and woodlands of much of their natural beauty. Many of the most beautiful ■wild flowers in New York state are now described in the official publications of the state as “now very rare’’. This destruction has all been brought about by those who claim to love flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is astonishing what can be done with, fresh cut flowers, when packed by experts. They have been shipped across the North American continent and across the Atlantic ocean. They have to go in a fixed temperature from point of shipment to destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the great Atlantic liners, every day they are at sea fresh flowers can be had in considerable variety. No matter how cold and stormy the weather, a bouquet can always be obtained from the sea, florist as fresh and charming as if ashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Florists know how to give blossoms cut for exhibition exceptionally delicate shades not obtained in actual growing of plants. This is done by dropping silver coins in the water in which the flowers stand. The silver hydroxide changes the natural color of the blossoms, and the new tints are fixed by adding a few crumbs of slaked lime or mortar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fresh cut flowers can be transported long distances and kept in perfect condition for several days by inserting the stems in slits cut in potatoes. They can be preserved indefinitely by dipping them in melted paraffin which is just hot enough to maintain its fluidity. Copper vases make the best ones. It is claimed that a copper receptacle will almost double the life of cut flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A scientist in Paris claims to have discovered a legitimate use for aspirin. A tablet is dissolved in warm water, and the solution when put in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> vase of cut flowers will freshen them. A flow’er worn in the buttonhole will also keep fresh if its stem is wrapped in a piece of cotton soaked in a similar solution. This is the only good thing we can say about aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ilelation of Flowers to Insects</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well known that flowers depend for their lives upon certain insects, especially bees. These visit them in succession in search of the nectar hidden deeply in their corollas. They brush against the anthers, rub off the pollen (usually a little sticky) and in entering the next flower leave some of it on the pistil, by means of which it reaches the seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The insects which pollenize the flowers are guided to the nectar by the various rows of dots or lines with which the flowers are marked. These point directly to the place where the nectar is concealed, and where, by the way, it is always well protected from the rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only are the useful insects shown where to find the nectar, but the latter is protected from raids by insects which would do the plant no good. Ants are kept away by bands of sticky secretions, or by sticky hairs on the stem or on the flower stalk or outside the calyx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many insects attack plants in search of food, and some live there as long as the flowers last. This is well known to the birds whose long and slender bills are adapted to this particular form of lunch-counter arrangement. Instead of such insects’ going up in smoke, they may be said to go up in song; not a bad way to go, if you have to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Australia it is noted that the country is deficient in insects, and it was necessary to import and acclimate bees before clover could be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">raised. In America we are blessed with all we need, and then some, and we need toads to keep them down. In twenty-four hours a toad will fill his stomach to its capacity four times with insects that are pests to man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In an effort to keep up •with the insects, modern chemistry has invented poisons, sprayers and dust guns to help the toads and birds keep the gardens from being overrun. The man behind the seed counter knows just what to advise. Ask him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Flowers May Be Pests &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems hard to think that flowers may be pests; yet how about the dandelion, the daisy, the goldenrod, and the milkweed&quot;? The Lantana is known in the United States as a pretty flower; but, imported into Hawaii, it has spread over the highlands and caused much loss of valuable grazing lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The water hyacinth was first introduced in Louisiana at a flower show in 1884. Since then, and now for twenty years, the streams of the state have been choked from bank to bank with water hyacinths through which no boat could pass. A way has now been found to kill it; that is with live steam played upon the flower from hoses. These shrivel up the entire plant, roots and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The daffodil is beautiful to look at, but hides a subtle poison. It must be handled with great care, as a slight abrasion of the skin may cause months of suffering. In South Africa there is a genus of the milkweed family that gives out the odor of the most distressing and offensive carrion. It is pollenized and kept alive by carrion-loving flies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The object of every flower is to bring forth fruit, so that the plant may live. When a flower has been fertilized it gives up its exquisite petals and its sweet perfume and devotes its entire energies to the work in hand. All life, including human life, is much the same. .y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In an average collection of 1,000 plants,/about 284 have white flowers, 226 yellow, 220 red, 141 blue, 72 violet, 26 green, 12 orange, 4 brown and 2 black. The white flowers are the most fragrant and have the sweetest perfumes. The fragrance of the plants of other colors runs in the order of their frequency, the least fragrant being those that occur most seldom. What a wise and kind arrangement!. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ ■.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ftowrs in Pieces</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You would not'expect to fin’d flowers far above the arctic circle, &quot;would you? Yet they are there, in midsummer, by the. million, in color and delicacy to vie with the tropics. The long hours of daylight thaw out the top soil, the rootlets fill with moisture, and the plants burst into bloom. Narcissus, tulips, English iris, gladiolus, hyacinth and the regal lily can be grown in Alaska on a commercial scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the rainy season every desert is a paradise of flowers. There are thousands of square miles of them, constituting the most beautiful flower gardens in the world. In Nevada it is against the law to uproot desert flowers. The molds on overripe bread and cheese are beautiful flowers when viewed under the micro</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">scope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A desert of asphalt and concrete and brick and stone, such as New York city, is a strange abode for flowers; and well the flower dealers of that great city know it. Prices are unconscionably high, and kept so by collusion between the wholesalers and retailers. By contrast with the charges in Paris and London the New York prices are outrageous. In New York flowers are $5 a dozen; in Paris a sprig of lily of the valley may be had for two cents. Retailers, working against the flower lovers of the city, discourage the raising and selling of outdoor-grown blossoms. Thus the common people of the city are deprived of flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earth is rare in Now York. In some shops it is sold at ten cents a pound for common, and fifteen cents for humus. When a plant dies the careful housewife removes the soil and stores it in the kitchen cupboard. Most backyards and courtyards are paved. It seems that about the only good places for plants are on the roofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We conclude with a few items regarding certain special flowers, arranged alphabetically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Begonia—Carnation—Chrysanthemum</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To offset the famous tulip fields of Holland, flower growers in Belgium have gone in for begonia fields, and with excellent results, from an artistic standpoint. Tulips require light, sandy soil, and much water, and do not thrive in the heavy loam of Belgium. The begonias come to perfection in August-September, the height of the tourist season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the International Flower Show, held at Ghent, Belgium, carnations which were almost blue and almost black have been shown. Ghent is one of the most important flower centers in the world, having seven hundred nurseries, hundreds of flower markets, and many huge conservatories, the last large enough to provide for the growth of full-sized palm trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chrysanthemum has been cultivated for two thousand year’s in China. There are now tens of thousands of varieties, ranging in size from a man’s head down to plants no larger than the tip of the finger. There are all colors except blue, and the plant grows in all shapes. It has been the official flower of Japan for five hundred years. A single new variety has sold for as much as $10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1789 Captain Blanchard, who plied between Marseilles and the Orient, brought back a thousand varieties of “Mums”, as they are called in the trade. Only one of these, the &quot;Old Purple”, lived. It remained for more than twenty years the only kind known in the •Western World. The Japanese have a method of coaxing an enormous number of blossoms on one stem. By this method one plant has been made to bear 1,100 flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dahlia—Daisy—Fern</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dahlia is a native of Mexico and still grows wild there. On account of its diversity of colors, beauty, variety of form, size, freedom, long season of bloom, and ease of culture, it is probably the most popular flower grown. It was not introduced into Europe until 1879, but in both Europe and the United States there are societies devoted specially to its development and there are now some ten thousand horticultural varieties. The plant is named in honor of Dr. Andre Dahl, Swedish botanist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dahlias will grow in any kind of soil that will grow high weeds, cabbage or potatoes. The soil should be put in the best possible condition before planting. Dahlias grow in all shades from dark royal purples, through rich maroons, magenta and mauve to the palest silvery lavender. There are no really blue dahlias, though lavenders with a bluish cast have appeared. The 'American dahlia society has more than two thousand members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The daisy, also called the marguerite, is, in name, a corruption of “day’s eye”, the sun. The American field daisy first bloomed on the battlefield of Saratoga, having been brought from central Germany in fodder to feed the English horses of General Burgoyne’s army. There are many varieties of daisies, the trembling star,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">gowan, little Easter flower,- a thousand charms, meadow pearl, goose flower, Mary’s flower, measure-of-love, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ferns receive less attention than they merit. There are but some sixty varieties (in New York state), but they are all adorable. Fems grow best it watered from the bottom. Just pour a cupful of water into the jardiniere and set the fern in it, when it will absorb all the water it requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A thick stand of grass, frequently cut, produces a much larger crop of grass than is generally realized. This heavy cropping exhausts the fertility of the soil, the grass turns brown, gaps in the turf occur and bunch grass and other wild grasses begin to appear. These are signs that the lawn needs food, and organic matter and commercial fertilizers must be supplied, if the greenness of the lawn is to be permanently maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Grass sometimes grows where it is not wanted. To kill grass between bricks, clean out the seams to a depth of a quarter inch and sweep in a little powdered bluestone. Ten cents worth of bluestone thus applied will cover fifty yards of paving and will last for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another way by which grass can be removed from any place where it is not desired is to scatter a few handfuls of crushed ferrous sulphate of iron (green vitriol) over the spots and then about half as much of powdered potassium chlorate. When sprinkled with water, sulphuric acid is released, and its effect is increased by the chlorine also released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eice grass, first introduced into Britain sixty years ago, is now being found of real value. Planted in the mud, it attracts more mud, and thus a sinking coast is being built up. Holland and Tasmania are using the grass for the same purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The gladiolus is increasing in popularity. Societies are forming around it. Among its many titles is “the universal flower” and “the poor man’s orchid”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Japanese iris, regal among its kind, was first introduced into this country in I860. About seven hundred varieties of it have been named. Two lots of iris were sown in late October and the plants were all kept in the same temperature. One lot, flooded with light eighteen hours a day, bloomed on Christmas day. The other lot, not provided with any artificial light, was still dormant as late as the following February..</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ivy, regarded by some as a pestiferous plant, is nevertheless a beautiful thing: its leaves are exquisitely shaped; its color is satisfying; if it kills buildings and trees it gives them a beautiful coffin any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Laurel—Lilac—-Lily</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The terms baccalaureate, poet laureate, etc., come from the word laurel, called by the ancient Greeks “daphne”. In ancient times berry-bearing twigs of it were wound around the heads of victorious heroes, poets, and other supposed benefactors of their day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are hundreds of varieties of lilacs, also called syringias. The old-time plants, seen in abundance on the grounds of ancient homes, were of only three or four varieties. It used to take seven years to bring the lilacs to bloom, but this time is now reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lily family is a big one. The onion is a lily bulb, and so is the asparagus. Tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, crocuses, are all members of the lily family. The lily, supposed to represent purity, is simple and noble in form, with plain, narrow, severe leaves, straight and upright stalk, and firm petals of puce and luminous whiteness. It does not easily bend to breeding tests. Science refers to it as stubborn, The Greeks and Romans prized it above all other flowers. An avalanche lily has been known to have twenty-one petals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The yucca, or Spanish bayonet, is an interesting lily of the American southwest. The leaves are harsh, dagger-tipped implements. They may lie on the ground or be eight feet in -the air. From the center rises a stalk like a flagpole, and at the top there finally breaks into bloom an assembly of pure white, bell-like, richly-perfumed, perfect lilies, the greatest single cluster of beautiful lilies known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Victoria Regia, mammoth of all water lilies, matures in sixty days after removal to the pond in early summer. The plants are then thirty feet square, with individual leaves six feet wide, capable of supporting the weight of a fifty-pound child. The Victoria Regia comes from South America, but a cousin in Japan and China produces four-foot floating leaves in less than nine days. The diameter of these leaves increases at the rate of nearly dialf an inch an hour. At that rate of growth the plant produces between 15 and 25 inches of leaf in 60 minutes. There are beautiful water lily nurseries at Griffin, Ga., in Tower Grove Park, St. Louis, and at Kenilworth, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Like some human creatures, the water lily sleeps at night, closing its buds and not opening them until the sun is high in the heavens the next day. Accordingly, the picking of water lilies is done between four and five o’clock in the morning, and shipments are rushed off while the plant is still asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Orehid—Peony—Poppy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is about three hundred years since orchids were found blooming in the New World. The orchid is still the aristocrat of flowers. There are hundreds of varieties. One species imitates the trunk of an elephant; another looks like a flying pigeon. The chimera startles the beholder with its resemblance to some fantastic and monstrous insect. The resemblance of these-flowers to animals is so exact that birds are often deceived by them. Central America is their habitat, but they have been found growing wild in Illinois. In Bronx Park, New York, is an orchid several hundred years old. It blooms every year, having as high as 1,200 pseudo-bulbs and several hundred flower stalks at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peony shares with the iris the honor of being the glory of the spring. By choosing early, mid-season and late varieties it is possible to have a longer peony season than is usually enjoyed. Peonies have been known to blossom in one spot for half a century, but they should be separated once in ten years; the iris once in three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Peonies ship well if picked in the bud. Florists often keep them for weeks in cold storage before putting them on the market. The vice president of a large manufacturing firm has on his letterhead the words “Henry S. Cooper, Peony Fan”. He wishes it known that he loves peonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poppies grow in great luxuriance in wheat fields. They can mature in the wflieat before it is cut. Superstition attaches to the poppies of the battlefields. It is an odd fact that the flower does not agree with other blooms, and if placed in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> bouquet with other flowers will either itself wilt or cause them to wilt, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Rose—Queen of Flowers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is now about twm thousand years since the Athenians crowned the rose as the queen of fi ewers, but it is doubtful if any Athenian ever saw such roses as grow out on the Pacific coast. If you think you have ever seen roses, go to Portland, Oregon, when the rose festival is on, and then you will know you have seen them, gorgeous, beautiful, gigantic, and in a profusion to make one bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we speak of rose-tinted glasses, rosy futures, roseate hopes, and when we tell our friends that they are as welcome as the roses in May, we involuntarily acknowledge the place which the rose holds in our affections. The rose is perfect in form, color, perfume and lasting qualities, and a general favorite the world over, in peace and in war, in life and in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Roses require humus. The plants that grow on manetti roots are stronger, and flower better, than those grown on their own roots. They stand severe pruning, and need much hoeing, so that the water and air get to the roots. Nothing is a better preventive of soil erosion than the roots and tentacles of the rambler rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Roses occasionally have green blossoms. England has a rose the color of which varies from pale yellow to yellow deeply splashed with red, depending upon whether it is cold or warm when the bud opens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Lebanon, N. FI., some years ago a rose bush outside a window sent a shoot into the cellar. Thence it found its way through a tiny knothole up into the living room, and eventually leafed out into a beautiful climbing rose filling a whole window with blossoms and the room with fragrance. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tulip— Violet—Wild Flowers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1636 Holland had a spell of tulipo-mania. The country and almost the whole of Europe went speculation-mad over tulips. Frenzied gambling took place. People sold all they had to buy tulips, and when the crash came thousands were ruined. Holland is still the center of the world’s tulip trade. People go to Holland from all over the world to see the tulip fields in the season when they are in bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tulip is the star weather prophet. Every year it puts on as many coats as it will need to stand the ensuing winter. In the fall of 1928 the tulip coats were the heaviest known, and the winter was the hardest ever known in Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Violets are made to bloom in the summer simply by cutting down the amount of sunlight to that of a spring day. It is the light, and not the heat, that controls the growth of the plant, and artificial light has the same effect as sunlight. The extra heat of summer has no effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Life preservers arc made in Germany from the pith of the sunflower. The material is eight times as light as cork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In gathering wild flowers the blossoms should be cut off with scissors, knife or clippers, not broken off by hand or pulled up by the stem. A few blossoms should be left on each root, so that the plant will not die. The gathering should be done in the field, and not by the roadside, so that the roadside beauty may be preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most sweeping damage to wild flowers is by the men who make a business of collecting them in. huge quantities and taking them to the cities for sale, along with the more decorative leaves and vines. Wild flowers fade quickly and are better left where nature put them. In some states laws have been passed to protect them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are some five thousand varieties of wild flowers in California, as compared with three thousand on the Atlantic coast and in the Mississippi Valley, but the incursions of motorists, campers and hikers have driven most of the rare varieties far into the hills and far on the road to extinction.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bear Sirs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I lately received a book entitled “Deliverance”, published by your Society. I had great pain in reading a book that contains so much nonsense, approaching in parts to blasphemy; and I had great pleasure in tearing it up and consigning it to the flames—a book far more pernicious than the most pernicious novel. If that is what Bible Students in your country call Christian doctrine, there is a wide gulf fixed between our country and yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours truly,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">And a Reply</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is always good for us to see ourselves as others see us. For that reason it was good for us to get your letter; and this reply will be good for you, if you take it in the right spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reason why Judge Rutherford’s book, filled from cover to cover with both the letter and the spirit of the Lord’s Word, was offensive to you as a clergyman is because of the nature of your occupation, and your sonship.—John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a clergyman you not only know, but could not fail to know, the true meaning of the Hebrew </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sheol </span><span class="font3">which your fellow religionists have so terribly distorted, but you also know the true meaning of the Greek equivalent, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font3"> and you well know that the centuries-old teachings of the Presbyterian church on this subject not merely approach to blasphemy, but actually are blasphemy, misrepresentation of God. You have only to glance at the marginal readings of the seven texts named below to know that we know what you have concealed from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course you had great pleasure in tearing up Judge Rutherford’s book and in consigning it to the flames. It interfered with your business, which business is that of exalting man and debasing God. You cannot deny it. Your own teacher’s Bible will prove it to you if you have the courage and manhood to look up the texts cited below. The Presbyterian ministry of today stands, not for the instruction of the people, but for their continued deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours truly, International, Bible Students Association.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Statement by The Leng-Bell Lumber Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font4">N THE October 30,1929, issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Age,</span><span class="font4"> page 75, there appeared an editorial “The Private Car Graft”. We understand that it is the desire of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> to get the facts and not misrepresent anyone, and further, we take it that it is your desire to publish matter which is based on provable facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time the article was printed, The Long-Bell Lumber Company owned, and today owns, a majority of the stock in three standard gauge, incorporated railroads. One of these railroads, The Longview, Portland &amp;&nbsp;Northern Railway, is located in the state of Washington and cost in excess of $5,000,000. Over this road certain fast passenger trains of the Great Northern and 'Union Pacific railroads, operating between Seattle and Portland, run between Longview Junction and Olequa, Washington, a distance of twenty-two miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The railroads in which the company owns the majority of the stock appear in the Official Kailway Guide; they file annual reports with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the proper state commissions and are subject to the same state and interstate laws that govern other carriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the issuance of free transportation to officers of incorporated railroads. This authority has always been construed by railroads to apply to officers of railroads and their business cars. The Long-view, Portland &amp;&nbsp;Northern Railway owned a business car, and the railroads accorded to the officials of the railroads in which we owned the majority of stock free transportation which included the car and officers of the railroads entitled to free transportation under the Act. Occupants of the car not entitled to free transportation paid regular fare. Any transportation of The Longview, Portland &amp;&nbsp;Northern business car was pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act as it was generally construed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On June 25, 1929, the Interstate Commerce Commission decided that the section of the Act authorizing and regulating the issuance of free transportation did not authorize the free handling of business cars on foreign roads, holding that the said section of the Act applied only to officers and employees and did not include business cars, and that a. car was property and under the Act was not entitled to free transportation. Since this decision of the Commission the practice of extending the free use of our lines to foreign line officers when occupying business cars has been discontinued and we have made no requests for free transportation for the Longview, Portland &amp;&nbsp;Northern business car. The same rules which control us apply to all railroads throughout the country and are being strictly adhered to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The facts stated are matters of record in the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is also a matter of public record that The Long-Bell Lumber Company, as was the case with many other lumber companies owning large tracts of timber, was compelled to build its own railroads from the point of connection with the trunk lines into the timber. The railroads connecting with these short line roads refused to expend the money necessary to build these roads, but did agree that when such roads were completed and incorporated they would establish through rates with such short lines to and from all points. It is also a matter of record that practically all of our large railroad systems operating today were originally composed of short line railroads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inference from the statement made in the October 30, 1929, issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is that The Long-Bell Lumber Company is enjoying a special privilege. This, as shown above, is untrue. In the first place the company itself enjoyed no privilege whatsoever, and in the second place any free transportation accorded to its officials and business car was a “privilege” accorded to railroad officials generally. To say that the officials of The Long-Bell Lumber Company do not pay fare when going from one part of the country to another is not a true statement, for only those persons ■who are officers of the railroads operated in Mississippi, Louisiana and Washington are entitled to, or have received free transportation; and this because they are railroad officers, and not because they have any connection with The Long-Bell Lumber Company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Thrilling Story of. the Late War, Told in the Language of the'Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Copyright, 1930, by Daniel E. Morgan </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">EN ROUTE TO BLANC MONT</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font4">T WAS expected now that we should all be sent to the rear for a much-needed rest? We laid in the woods, awaiting orders, a sort of comforting prepared with old pieces of logs stretched from tree to tree in tent-like form. Not for long, though. We were soon again on the move, every heart filled with freely-discussed plans for our leave of rest and refreshment in one of the summer resorts of sunny France—a rest which never came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our march rearward started out with much laughter and many jokes about the happenings and tragedies of the slaughter-house days, now dimly in the past. Some of the boys who had a habit of getting sick or falling off a train at about a day’s journey from the front had now rejoined us. They told tales of adventure in Paris. It made one feel sick at having stuck with the outfit as we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fame of the “Devil Dogs” had spread all over France. The country had opened her arms and taken into her bosom every one who had on a “Marine” emblem (ornament), except, of course, the fighting men who never got far enough in the rear to receive anything except the stories about it. It was these stories, told us by the boys who had disappeared on the eve of battle, that made our blood run hot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rewarding the Windbags</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many in Paris and other points who had never heard the shot of a gun borrowed a “'Marine” emblem for the occasion. These were picked up on the streets, taken to halls and cafes, wined and dined by the rich and the poor, and were feted and praised, with an open door to any and everything desired, oven to the use of the French girls, which was followed later by much sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a price to pay for the desire for a good time, and the lack of a little self-control! The sacred things of the wedding chamber now ran riot with the ghastly horrors of war: they were looked upon as a tonic, something necessary for health. Before the war ended many a boy hoped to die rather than face the future burdened with a loathsome disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was all very plain to us that the soldiers from the rear had had more to say about the battle than, those at the front. Sickening tales they were, all garbled up with imaginings. How we hated to hear their jabbering about something they knew nothing about 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Replacing Lost Articles</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I had a mishap. On my v/ay to a pool for a shave, I lost my razor. During the last battle I had raided the dead to the extent of taking some needed toilet equipment: might as well, for the burying squad would only take them anyway. I lost my little black razor. I had another, yet I spent a day looking for the little black one, all to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We found ourselves hiking along long and dreary roads. There was no end to them. It sickened one’s heart when miles ahead he could see a trail that must be trod by the tramp, tramp of weary feet.going up and down. We stopped by the roadside. Everybody ran to the creek, either to bathe his feet or to drink. Drinking from wayside waters was forbidden, but we drank anyway. The road was hot and dusty and we thought we must have been miles in the rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There appeared two unusual forms coming 'down the road. We all tried to figure them out. Maybe they were French nurses, a sight we had not seen since our first day in the trenches. Imagine thousands of men, grinding out their existence in the cogs of a perpetual war minus the companionship of a single female, now gazing as two feminine creatures passed by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Empires have been builded and wars have been fought for voinen. And why not? It is at least something to fight for. These were American nurses, real American girls. As they passed us we all said as if with one breath, “Hello! It is good to see you: like meeting a friend from your own home town.” We dragged ourselves along with at least a change of thought from the dogged tramping of feet going up and down. Hurrah for another set of brain cells working!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Manz had a thought, aided by the passing of the girls, along with the hot, dry, dusty roads (that would dry up and parch the throat: of a camel). Said he, “How would you like to be over in the good old U. S. A., with your foot on' the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">bar, licking up a big schooner of beer ?” Everybody laughed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nimic’s Little Joke</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nimic got a thought. Pointing back to the girls, he said, “There goes Dan and his girl, automobile walking.” The boys kidded the shirt off me. My girl in blue wrote and mailed a note to me every day; so you can bet that when the mail arrived if anyone got a letter it was I. Much of our mail was lost. Sometimes batches were weeks and weeks overdue. That was to be expected. The efforts to provide us with our mail were commendable. Because of the many letters from her, my girl in blue became the company sweetheart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where were we going? The hopes and joys and dreams of a possible romance were shortlived. Thoughts must have something to feed upon. What thoughts can come to one when muscles are grinding and weary bones are cracking and screeching!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We sang. The Devil himself would be ashamed to put into writing the dirty and horrible songs we sang. The captain rode back on his horse. He ordered us to close up our lines and throw away our swagger sticks. We were </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">behind</span><span class="font4"> the lines now and diis holy presence’ was everywhere. At the front his abode was a bomb-proof dugout. We almost felt as if some one ought to shoot him. Well, I would not be the one, for I would find no pleasure in shooting even a brute like him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Basis of Our Hope &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had a hope. Had we not, away back there in the “land of the free”, raised our right hands and sworn that we would not rebel against forced marches, and sealed it by kissing the Holy Bible? We now saw that this was all the product of cunning and supermind. But we had hope. They were falling out fast now, and I might be the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We slept that night in the woods. It was raining. The air was heavy, soggy. Could it be that even the gods of the air were against us? Did anyone know whither we were bound ? A pig can get a thought, after he does the same thing often enough. We had been promised a leave, and as long as we marched during the day and slept during the night there was hope that we might get it. But the program changed. We hiked by night and slept by day. A clue! We were headed for the front, The darkness of the night was our covering from the eyes of the enemy. Not so dumb, what ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The days became somewhat lighter. Reinforcements were brought in. Our thinned ranks were filled by recruits. We shot craps and played cards in the woods. Even the exchange of the French money, which we could not spend, and which seemed to us like cigarette coupons, lent refreshment to our tired minds. AVe stayed in the woods for days, and, mind you, we got a meal every day. The rats were not so sure of theirs, for we saved the crumbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fresh Recruits</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The recruits were given their places. They were brimful of hot air from the slippery tongues of the “dollar” patriots and politicians. These men, who dine in palaces, live on velvet carpets, and work behind plate glass, wanted war; and so did the recruits. We signed up, the hardened soldiers in positions of trust: the new-comers were put to work as muleteers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pious-faced frauds had bellowed out from thousands of pulpits that this was a “holy war”. Too holy, the recruits soon found out. A recruit came to me with tears in his eyes, saying, “I didn’t come over here to take care of mules. I came over to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">lie said: “You officers and men of the Second Division, upon you has been bestowed great honor. The field marshal of the allied forces has selected you for an attack on Blanc Mont. The French have failed three times.” And we knew what a slaughterhouse it had been.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It vcas at sundown some days later. A great battle was on. We were on a very high hill, back with the light artillery. Our observation was good. Who was fighting ? We did not know. In the far distant valley, and on the farther hillside could be seen the forms of men running first this way and then that. They were going over the top. The shelling was heavy. We could see the bursting shells, like little black-and-white balls of clouds coming out of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sky was filled with planes, about three hundred. The heavy bombing planes were flying in a V formation, some sixteen to little devils flying up and down, in and out, searching every cloud for an enemy plane. They looked like a lot of sparrows and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">black crow that had signed a peace treaty and become allies. The bombing planes carried tons of TNT to wreak havoc upon their assigned objects. Some of the planes would never come back; that was understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Relieving the French</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Night came upon us. We were headed in the 'direction of the attack. All night we plugged along, up and 'down hills, 'dodging the shell holes, wrecked trucks, dead horses, and empty ' ammunition shells. There was a dead, silent horror among us. We said nothing. Every last man understood, without being told, that we were the reserve of the battle ahead, and that when they had poured out their life's blood, we should relieve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were on the brow of the hill or half-grown mountain. The shell craters or exploded mines had left holes in mother earth that you could put a six-room house in. Down on the other side we ran into the French. Our artillery and light 75’s rushed into position like bees. &quot;We ‘ were going to relieve the French. The poor frogs were glad to get out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a black night. We stumbled into what had been hurriedly prepared trenches, or better call them ditches, about two or three feet deep. In spots they went deeper, where some son of a French peasant had sought and still sought shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We greeted them, and it resulted in our having a kissing bee. It is the custom of the French. A full ration consists of a kiss on each cheek, and a couple of hugs thrown in. Pointing toward the enemy they said, “Germans here, and Germans there; good-bye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Hey, wait a minute,” (and, in the best French we knew) “what have you got to drink? Anything?” We did not have to be told that the French got a little stimulant as part of their ■regular ration: we knew it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Any grub?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Cheese.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All right: we will take it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They had more food coming out than we had going in. We would be over the top ourselves, in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sleeping with the Dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were not many Frenchmen to relieve. They had paid a terrible price for their part in the onslaught. We began to learn this now. As I sought a place in this light trench in which to take a flop before dawn, I crawled on what at first seemed to be some old bags. I felt a little spooky, with my jaws jerking and twitching from much shattered nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beaching with my hands, as I crawled over the web bags, I discovered that the “bags” were nothing more than dead men, all busted up. How many I did not know. The chills ran through my blood as my fingers pressed into the shattered anatomies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How dead the flesh of a dead man feels! The rats would not mind it. I did, and turned back, only to find other dead men along the opposite side. I did not hear any of the boys. A ghastly calm hung over everything, as it always does before an attack. I dug a little hole as far away from each corpse as I could, and thus passed the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bang I On the extreme right. It startled me. I must have been asleep. Another on the left! The day was dawning. There were many more shots. These were our own batteries. The sky was lighted. The shots- roared past, just over ourheads, altogether too close. We ducked. Two of us crawled together. The dead stayed dead. It became lighter. The air was filled with smoke, and the gases from exploding shells in the enemy lines just ahead of us became stifling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It became daylight. The range of the batteries was lifted. The shells were sent, raging missiles of death, farther into the rear of the enemy’s lines. Up and at them we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Over the Top</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a hell hole we had been in! The French dead lay everywhere. The sight sickened me. The brains and guts of what had once been men lay scattered over the field. I shut my eyes and plowed through them, the greasy slime sticking to the bottom of my shoes. I would have vomited if there had been anything in me to come out. It seemed as if my stomach and bowels were racing for my throat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We pushed on. The wrecked and broken pieces of flesh seemed to move. The earth trembled from the terrific bombardment of thousands of high-explosive shells. We reached the enemy’s linos, their front lines, but there was no life, and we took no prisoners. The artillery had done her stuff. We came on machine gun nests built out of concrete, with the guns, some of them in place, sticking out of the mountain: for we were now on Blanc Mont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well known that a retreating army sets all sorts of traps to hinder its foes. We had heard, but not seen, that such things as fountain pens were loaded, with explosives, to blow out the eyes of those who picked them up. One might touch almost anything and be blown to pieces. The effects were there, sure enough. We all pressed on with constant fear of being blown to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Blanc Mont . ■ <sub>::</sub> ■</span><span class="font4"> m . , . <sub>; :</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other side of Blanc Mont it sloped down in a gradual decline, and then stretched out, with ravines here and there as one went along. We felt that the gods must have our wave length, and many of the boys said that this would be their last battle. They felt it, in some mysterious way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The night was black and an Italian boy and I were waiting in a shell hole. He clung close to me, his body quivering, and said, “I feel as though I am going to get bumped off this time.” I tried,to quiet him. He shivered on. In the' onrush we separated. He was killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a crossroad we stopped for a spell.’As all crossroads are important junction points-for traffic and for reinforcements, this was being heavily shelled by the enemy. Two or three of us crawled out one of the roads a short way, seeking protection. We lay fiat, behind’ what looked like dead horses and men. I lay there without touching either. What did I care, what could I care, whether they were men or mules •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Along in the early hours of the morning we were shelled with gas, tear gas that blinded one so that he could not see where he was going. Sometimes it was gas that made one sneeze.-We were pastmasters at the gas game, and’ only the mustard gas did we really fear. We could tell a gas shell by its sound while in flight, it being a light, empty sort of a hissing whistle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one was macle to vomit by the poisons, he would do so, making sure that the tube of, the mask was in his mouth before taking the .next breath of air. I have fallen asleep with my mask on, and awakened with my nose along the edges of the rubber burning like fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the day dawned, the tragedies of the night appeared. Some died by reason of taking off the mask too soon. Here and there they- wferie in the ditches half-buried, a customary, but now meaningless sight &quot;to us. Many of the 'green troops died ere the pomp of the parade ground had worn off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Waning Respect for Officers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I came to a dugout, and upon going down a few steps saw an officer and thirty or forty men with their gas masks on. The parade ground bunk was that after a gas signal had been given no enlisted man should take off his mask until ordered to do so by an officer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ I yelled, “Take off your mask!” and a dignified young officer told me who he was.; that I should have known he was an officer, and asked my name and company commander. I told him that he was in the war now and might as well learn the game right. The boys took off their masks. I told the lieutenant that his outfit was farther front, and that it was his duty to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On over the side of the hill I met one of our lieutenants.' The enemy machine guns were sweeping the woods with their harassing fire. Buzz, buzz, buzz, the little steel devils flew past. We ducked for a concrete shed, with a door and window in it, something like our American country coal houses. The fire was very intense. In the shed we felt safe from these little teasers. It was the lieutenant’s first battle. He had just received his commission, having been a caretaker of mules during other battles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were watching our chance to move up farther to the enemy lines. It was a hot time for our lieutenant, and things began to move for him inside as well as out. There was a sort of pan in this little hut we were in, and there, right under our noses, this officer did a goodsized job. An officer, a leader of men, phew! I took hold of the pan and threw it out the ■window. It is to the officers that soldiers must submit their personal letters for censorship. A strange arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Some Officers Fine Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outside of the hut I met Sergeant McNulty, our top sergeant. He and I talked over our methods of support and advance. A mighty fine soldier was Mac, and very courageous. The bullets flew past and Sergeant Mac had his finger shot off. We tied it up and according to the rules and laws he should have withdrawn to the rear. Not Mac; he came to help place and organize my gun crews, and did the work for which he came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were on the point of a two-mile wedge .'driven into the enemy lines. That meant that we were surrounded on three sides. We set up our guns and watched the poor unfortunates on the other side of a little field and woods prepare for an attack. It was a duel with machine guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We started a stream of steel bullets down along the ■woods, watching it kick up the dust as it went, until it reached the boys on the other ridge. There was much movement on their part as they scattered for shelter by lying flat upon the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We could not tell if we scored any hits. Beast-like instinct compels everyone to drop at the first sound of a bullet or shell. A machine gun duel is not so exciting when a hole is at hand for shelter. Once below the surface of the ground, one is practically safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We moved for positions of advantage. I noticed, for the first time, that I was hiding in an ammunition dump, and a large one at that. Hastily I withdrew farther to the rear. We heard German machine guns at our rear, toward our left; they were attacking to cut us off from our base. Our wedge had been driven in too far. The ammunition dump where we had been lying was now aflame. It staged a bombardment in every direction. Officer Soltowski, one of the real officers, was killed. A direct hit got him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Time to Die</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font4">T IS not very pleasant to 'die at any time, but if we all must die, then obviously we should all want to die under the best conditions, so that we may wind up in the right place. The time to die is now’ located. The chaplain at the Ohio state penitentiary, Father O’Brien, speaking of the eighty-five Catholics among the three hundred and twenty prisoners who were burned alive in Ohio’s ancient prison, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All of them I know had received holy communion on Easter Sunday in the chapel, and if I am any judge of human nature, there was a place waiting in heaven for those men. Just before they died, I baptized two young fellows who had been studying to enter the church. As you know, baptism wipes away every stain of .wrong, and those men died with spotless souls.”-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This explains how to do it. All you have to do to get three hundred and twenty prisoners to heaven is to lock them in a wooden cell house, set fire to it, put the key to the cell house in the care of a seventy-two-year-old guard, and the rest is easy; at least, easy on the relatives. They will not have to dig up any money for masses for the repose of their relatives’ souls. 'They go straight to heaven.’ This is more than can be said for the popes, because it is the common custom to say mass for the repose of their souls, no matter how ‘good’ they have been, or how bad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Glimpse at Financial Conditions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HE sweep of .events, especially since the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wall Street crash, indicates that we are moving, slowly but surely, toward uncertainty, chaos, and eventually Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recent events prove without a doubt, to the perceiving, that the crumbling of the social order is taking place in all fields of endeavor: ecclesiastical, political, commercial, educational; and that the groat god of Gold, upon which they all depend, is crumbling along with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Wheat Plunges to $1.00 Despite Farm Board Aid”; “Russia Dares World to Attack Red Army—Atheism Gaining”; “Boulder Dam Bared as Pawn in Power Row”; “Hoover Calls Leaders to Cut Down Expense,” etc., are some of the headlines in New York and Chicago papers as of February 25,1930, and indicating a few of the vast problems confronting the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We truly cannot know all the details or go into them at the present writing. A few observations and comparisons may not be amiss if they will help to serve and give greater strength and courage to the faithful, and those walking toward the light of the new day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It may be remembered that at the time of the Wall Street crash, there was organized a banking group to try to stabilize the downward crash of stocks. The New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font4"> of the above date contained the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The end was written to one of the most interesting chapters of the 1929' stock market break last night with the announcement on the part of the bankers’ consortium, which entered the market to “stabilize” prices in that trying period between Oct. 24th and Nov. 13th, that it had completely liquidated its market position. . . . The bankers, who, some time since, announced their purpose to refrain from doing injury to the market by dumping stocks, have apparently been able to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">feed out their holdings during the rise</span><span class="font3"> in prices since the first of the year, [italics ours.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very good bankers. Buy low and sell higher. But why the great hurry ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering they had good stocks (and a banker will never pick a poor one with his eyes open), why didn’t they play their usual game, and hold on to these investments until there was a considerable rise in values, comparable in part to the high values of 1928-9? Ah, why not indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because, of all men versed in the knowledge of business and economics, your banker has his hand upon the pulse of the money-god, and the result is not reassuring: he finds that times are not so good; he is doubtful that he could get his</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By F. W. O’Neil</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">money back when he wants it, in spite of the optimistic predictions after the crash; for indeed, the god of Gold is again on the sick list 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To quote further, under the same date:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another severe break in the wheat prices, unsatisfactory week-end reports from the steel industry and a slight stiffening in money rates combined to depress the share market yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed/wheat plunging down to the farmers’ bugaboo price of $1.00 a bushel was not the least of his troubles. The Associated Press stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Out in the country the farmer was getting far less than a dollar for his wheat. At Wichita, Kansas, today, elevators cut ten cents from the price of their scale for wheat delivered by wagons. The top price was 86 cents a bushel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cotton also went down to a new low level, and so stalk injustice and manipulation throughout the whole fabric of the financial system!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poor farmer! Poor storekeeper! Poor unemployed! Poor world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Go into these streets and avenues of New York. Store after store, sale after sale; and discounts ranging from 33-1- to 50 percent are common. Winter goods such as suits and coats are in many instances priced at a third to one quarter their former values. And the unemployed, far too many unemployed, walk the streets unable even to take advantage of these reductions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A railroad shop thirty miles out of New York laid off about 120 men and cut the week to five days. It is estimated that 40 percent of the building trade in New York, is unemployed. Money is so tight from the mortgage angle that it has reduced the building and buying of homes to a minimum. A Californian on a trip East said they were just beginning to feel the effects of the crash on the coast. And so it goes all along the line. A well informed chain store investigator and manager notes many of the small chain stores going out of business. Many individuals are selling their last stocks and quietly fading out of the picture. Failures in February were the highest since 1922; data, compiled by R. G. Dun &amp;&nbsp;Co. show 2,759 commercial failures in January, with 2,262 for February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what says Washington? It may be remembered that President Hoover called ■ conferences of commercial executives to help stabilize business after the crash. Undoubtedly, according to national conditions, it was neces-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">sary, and wise. It still remains to be seen just how unselfishly these executives keep the faith. And to help business along, the political power, or Congress, agreed to reduce the income tax something like one percent on incomes up to $5,000, with, varying percentages as the amounts increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now a warning goes out from President Hoover that drastic cuts in expenses by the government must be made; that it is essential to safety; or that a 40 percent increase in taxes threatens!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So here we run the gauntlet again, the same old fallacy of “each one for himself”. Each man must fight for himself in this selfish -world organization; each business and organization must fight to protect itself; and finally the government, seeing the fruits of the financial debacle of last October affecting its oven pocketbook and well-being, cries out for its own safety. These cautious men, looking ahead, see written large upon the ledger of the country: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reduced income tax returns,</span><span class="font4"> upon which it depends in goodly part for its maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How is it so affected? Let us take one individual who bought shares in 1928 at $500 a share. At the time of the crash, being an average individual, he sold, in order to get out with a part of his investment at least. This he did by selling at the best price he could got, which was generally lew; and if he sold at $200 a share, which would be about the general average in proportion, his loss would be $300. If he had 100 shares he lost $30,000 on the transaction, and he naturally shows a loss of income, and his tax accounting shows likewise. Multiply this in varying amounts for hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and the result is disconcerting despite the prosperity and profits shown by the industry of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the situation has taken a decidedly pessimistic tone since the crash, though such reaction is nothing unusual. The low prices of stocks and commodities, tight mortgage money, liquidation sales, reducing of working hours in many instances, indicate the desire to get hold of, not wealth in the form of goods, but notes and currency; in other words, MONEY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So it raises another question: If money was really so active and abundant to have helped put values up so high in 1928-9, where is all the money now? why is there a straining to get hold of the almighty dollar ? Surely it is somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ah, yes! And if you could get a look into the vaults of the financial organization and the strongholds of money-wise king-pins, you would see money in abundance; though their unwritten law would be: ‘Reserved,. until conditions ease; not to be used unless exceptional circumstances warrant, and then under terms of the greatest security/ Hoarding, just like any peasant, afraid to trust their neighbor men, until the fear passes and security again appears to ride in the saddle. Self first, every time for individual, shopkeeper, financier and government; and who says it can be otherwise under the present systems of error ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a paymaster, it was my privilege in the past to observe this tightening and releasing in the<sup>-</sup>money mart. It was rather surprising to see the flood of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">gold</span><span class="font4"> certificates released for distribution from strong boxes and vaults some years after the war, and after security seemed assured. And how business started to smile when it saw these yellow-backs, with all they implied, instead of the silver notes, going into circulation again. For those gold certificates were payable in gold upon demand; and the money-wise, always grasping the means to the greatest security in times of seeming stress and fear, had salted away a hoard of gold. For to the money-wise, the power of gold is the final court of security! Poor blind souls!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And how can money circulate and promote the welfare of the people when hundreds of thousands of the rich f ollow their example ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But not only is the money system unreliable and selfish; it is as unjust and intolerant as the greed and selfishness of men can make it. Money should act as life-blood to the people of the nation, flowing freely to every individual according to his work and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">needs;</span><span class="font4"> and not, as at present, restricted, inflated, deflated and accumulated into vast monopolies and fortunes, which, like clotted arteries, stifle and restrict the lives of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For material wealth is really the fruit of productive effort as expressed in buildings, clothes, commodities, luxuries, etc., but man has so muddled his ideas of values by trying to class everything into wealth, that he calls money wealth; whereas it is really nothing more than a medium of exchange, actually a bit of paper or a mite of metal. And when men’s fears can cause deflation, such as experienced by Germany and Russia ten years ago, who cares to measure the result in a world-wide calamity ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let there be no mistake: every earthly organ-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>602</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' The QOLDEN AGE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">n. «.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ization and system depends upon this god of Gold or Silver for support. Panics mean nothing to a later generation which experienced them ■ not, but just as all wars are going to end by a Power superior to war, so will the final catastrophe of money be, and so devastating in its sweep that the world will stand aghast at its appalling destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For “they shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">because it is the stuniblingblock of their iniquity.” </span><span class="font4">—Ezekiel 7:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They racketeer for gold. They murder for ■ gold. By outright buying or subtle graft big utilities and financial organizations grasp for the power of gold. The same trend is found in bootlegging, which, overridden by the power of . financial greed, helps break down the foundations of and respect for the law. We see the first symptoms of civic chaos, because of graft, indifference and wastefulness, in Chicago’s unsound and bankrupt government; we see the curious spectacle of millions of “Christian” people all over the world imploring the God of heaven for or against the Soviet- government, at the instigation of a church which protested little until actual material wealth of church property, ; jewels, etc., began to be despoiled and her ppwer . utterly overthrown. We see a bolshevik' nation • striving to increase production by elimination of the sabbath, and blaspheming and defying rihe Almighty God with supreme contempt in a <sup>;</sup> national policy of atheism. We see the silver standard countries, such as India and China, in financial stress, with a suspicion of conspiracy on the part of the gold standard financiers, as the Mexican dollar, which is the principal unit of China’s currency, declined to a new low rate of 33.58 cents to the dollar. Prices of everything are soaring, and living costs have been sharply affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And yet these are not the days of the “great tribulation”: they are but indications of the ■ impending storm. And if we rejoice in the khowl-• edge of the grander day to come, in that His will and truth will triumph, and in seeing the unjust and unsound earthly systems crumble in the dust, let us not overlook the fact that in the ' material overthrow, it will be the people, blindly seeing but understanding not, or unhappily ignorant, who will suffer most.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font4">INCE the article telling of the remarkable value of black walnut leaf tea was published, many have inquired where the dried leaves could be obtained, and have written to the ■ writer about the matter. When I wrote the article I lived in La Grande, Oreg., and there were lots of black walnut trees there. I saved a supply of the leaves, and gave them free to those who wanted to try them. They all reported that the tea did them remarkably good service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have now moved to Los Angeles, Calif., and there are no black walnut trees that I know of around here; so I have none of the leaves. I never sold these leaves, and am not in position to gather or supply them at present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bible Ooestion and Answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">^WESTION</span><span class="font4">.• Does the Bible teach capital</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*¥ punishment? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font4"> Capital punishment refers to the death penalty. Some people are opposed to the death penalty, from motives of sentiment. They look upon it as cruel and barbarous, and try to convince themselves that God is too loving to deprive another of the right to live. Others view capital punishment from the standpoint of retaliation, vengeance, and, with hatred toward the guilty one, rejoice in the fact that “he got what he deserved”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neither of these positions is the correct one. It is the function of justice to determine what the penalty for any crime should be. Justice should never be guided by sentiment, nor by vengeance or retaliation. If sentiment controls, the penalty will be inadequate, and ofttimes the guilty will go free to menace the lives and liberties of others. On the other hand, if jealousy, hatred, retaliation or vengeance controls, ofttimes the culprit will suffer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">too</span><span class="font4"> severe a penalty, and at other times punishment will be wreaked upon those who are entirely innocent, as ofttimes occurs, for the reason that hatred, jealousy and retaliation are never guided by reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Justice takes into consideration the heinousness of the crime; the measure of wilfulness and premeditation; the degree of provocation and the extent of the damage, injury or loss imposed upon others. Sentiment and retaliation never consider these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God is the most loving being in the universe. Nevertheless, He did not allow His love or sympathy to interfere in meeting out the sentence of capital punishment to Adam for his crime in Eden, Adam’s sin was without excuse; it was unprovoked; it showed an extreme degree of irreverence and ingratitude toward his Creator; it also showed that he did not appreciate the blessings of life, liberty, peace, health, happiness, and his beautiful home and environment. More than this, his offense brought disease, selfishness, crime, sin and death upon over 20,000,000,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore his guilt could not be condoned, and a proper, adequate and just sentence was to take away the privileges and blessings which he did not appreciate, and deprive him of the power to do further harm. Wisdom and justice combined to decree this sentence, and love approved the same. It was a merciful act toward that wicked, selfish and ungrateful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All through the Bible capital punishment is taught. In Exodus 21:23, 24 we read: “If any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” Again, in Genesis 9:6 we read: “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coming to the New Testament we find Jesus saying to Peter, at the time he struck off the ear of the high priest’s servant: “Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God alone can give life; therefore it is a sacred thing. For a member of the race to take the life of another, which he cannot restore, and which he did not give, is not only a crime against that individual, but a crime against God. Since God alone can give the life, He, and He alone, has the right to take away the life, or to decide what shall be the penalty for taking a life. God’s Word contains His decree, and that decree is that if a man shed another man’s blood, then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">man shall be his executioner.</span><span class="font4"> In other words, God has decreed that man shall act as God’s executioner in the matter. The sentence against Adam was so just that love could not interferemnd set aside that sentence; therefore there was only one way that love could act for the deliverance of Adam and his race from that death penalty, and that was to provide a substitute, who would take Adam’s place in death. That substitute was Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is possible for any member of the race to sin again, after having been delivered from the Adamic condemnation, and God has decreed that for such a sin the penalty shall be death, second death; and this will be capital punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While God has decreed that capital punishment is a proper penalty for certain crimes, it often occurs that justice miscarries under present conditions. Sometimes the guilty escape punishment, and sometimes the innocent suffer. This is not God’s fault, nor the fault of the penalty. It is due to the fact that men are unjust, unwise, cruel, selfish, and wicked. Sometimes jurors and judges are bribed, either to acquit or to convict. And again the charge of murder is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">framed</span><span class="font4"> against certain persons and they are falsely condemned to death. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These facts, however, are not an argument against capital punishment, when the persons are convicted beyond a doubt, but are an argument against the present-day methods of securing the conviction of persons charged with murder. These facts also argue strongly for the necessity of the kingdom of Christ, wherein justice shall be meted out to everybody, and wherein justice, wisdom, love and power shall all unite to bless everybody.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4">THE law of Jehovah God is supreme, and any -A- wilful infraction thereof is sin. It is written in God’s Word: &quot;Sin is the transgression of the law.” One who attempts to run ahead of Jehovah God and claims the ability to do what God has declared He alone can and will do is presumptuous. Wilfully taking a course of action contrary to the expressed will of God is therefore a presumptuous sin. The proud, arrogant and self-willed pursue such a course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest doctrinal truth set forth in the Bible is that concerning God’s kingdom which Ho has repeatedly declared He will establish with Christ as Head thereof. That kingdom will put to rout and destroy all the enemies of God and of man and will establish righteousness on the earth and will completely vindicate the word and name of God. Any man or company of men claiming to ho followers of Christ Jesus and then announcing their ability and purpose to establish righteousness and peace on the earth show that they are proud and' arrogant and are guilty of presumptuous sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If that company of men further claim that it is the purpose of their organization to make the earth a fit place for man so that Christ can come and take possession of it they are guilty not only of presumptuous sin but of the additional crime of blasphemy. The crime of blasphemy is the doing of any thing or act or uttering speech that brings reproach upon the name of God and upon His Christ. I shall here submit the proof from the Bible that the clergy of America, and the Protestant clergy in particular, are guilty of both presumptuous sin and blasphemy in connection with the kingdom of God. This I shall do, not for the purpose of holding up men to ridicule or scorn, but that the people may see the truth and be enabled to take their stand on the side of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The kingdom of God being the most important doctrine of the Bible, it is emphasized therein more than any other doctrine. The kingdom means the royal house, composed of Jesus Christ the Head and His immediate associates, that shall rule all the nations of the earth. (Rev. 12: 5; 3: 21; 2: 26) Its importance is emphasized by the fact that more than four thousand years ago God made a promise to Abraham and bound 6C5</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">that promise with His oath that He would produce and set up the kingdom for the blessing of man. God chose the Israelites and for many centuries used that people to make pictures of His manner of selecting and setting up the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God chose Moses and by him performed certain duties of importance and made of Moses a type foreshadowing the great King and kingdom that He would establish in the future. In Deuteronomy 18:15, 18, God caused to be recorded that He would raise up One of whom Moses was a type and that that great One would be the Ruler of the people and that all the people must obey Him if they would live. By His prophet Micah (5:2-5) He declared that this great Prophet or King would be born at Bethlehem. By His prophet Isaiah (9: 6, 7) God declared that the righteous government or kingdom would rest upon the shoulder of that mighty One and that He would establish peace and righteousness and that there would be no end thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great Prophet and King thus described by the prophets is Jesus Christ the Son of God. He came to the earth, as foretold, and at the end of His ministry He offered Himself as King to the Israelites and was by them rejected. That was merely the miniature fulfilment of the prophecy and foreshadowed the greater fulfilment in Jesus the glorified One offering Himself as King to the world, which He did in due time. It was necessary for Him first to die as a man and be raised from the dead, in order that He might be the Redeemer of man and that man might be restored to life during the righteous reign of Christ. He was raised from the dead and clothed with all power in heaven and earth; He is the Redeemer of man, and during His reign He will restore all the obedient ones of the human race to health and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Necessity for the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why should God set up a kingdom? Briefly stated, the Scriptures show the following reason : God gave His son Lucifer an organization; and perfect man, who was created and put on the earth, was a. part of that organization. Lucifer became a traitor to God and turned against Jehovah and led the members of his organization, including man, into the course of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">wickedness. From that 'time-forward Lucifer has been known as Satan the Devil God could have deprived him of his power and influence over the world, but it suited His purposes best not to do so at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan defied God to put a man on earth who would maintain his integrity with God and faithfully serve Him under stress. Jehovah God accepted the challenge, and told Satan to do his worst; and then God gave His word or promise that He would form a new organization and. make His beloved Son Christ Jesus the Head thereof and that this new organization would constitute His kingdom or government of righteousness and would rule- all the nations of the earth. The detail of the matter is set forth in a hook called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> which you should carefully study, especially that part dealing with the book of Job. Just now I can give only a brief statement of the facts. The purpose of the kingdom of God is not merely to save and bless men; but the most important reason for its establishment and existence is that it might completely prove that God is true and right and that He is the only source of life and happiness. It will vindicate His word and name; and that is the most important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Would it not seem passingly strange that the kingdom of God, which is the most important organization in God’s universe, would be committed or left to imperfect man to establish? Is it not plain to all that the claim of imperfect man to possess the power, ability and authority to establish lasting peace and righteousness on earth is not only presumptuous, but blasphemous, because it reproaches the name of Jehovah God and disputes His word?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the greatest lessons that Jesus taught His followers was that they should pray that God would establish His kingdom, and not that man should do it. Jesus said: When thou pray-est, after this manner pray. Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as in heaven.’ He did not tell His followers to get things ready for Him that He might come back. On the contrary, He stated to them, in John 14:2, 3: T go away to prepare a place for you, and I will come again and receive you.’ And, in Luke 22: 29: ‘My Father has appointed for me the kingdom.’ The place that He promised to prepare is the new organization of which Christ Jesus is the Head and which shall rule the world in righteousness and completely clean it of all wrong’ and unrighteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He so thoroughly impressed His disciples with the importance of the kingdom that among the last questions they propounded to Him was, when would He come again and set up the kingdom? The coming of the Lord and the setting up of God’s kingdom has been the hope; of every true follower of Christ from that clay till now. Jesus told them that the end of the v-orld and His coming would be marked by a great world war. That prophecy was fulfilled in 1914. Since then many other prophecies have been fulfilled, and others are in course of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">League</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of the World War a compact designated as the League of Nations was brought forth. The announced purpose of the League was and is to outlaw war and to establish a lasting peace amongst the nations of the earth. In January, 19.19, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, which, claims to represent God on earth and to speak for Him, came forward with, the bold and arrogant announcement that The League of Nations is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’. In other words, that the nations of the earth banded together in a League had assumed the obligation to outlaw war and to establish lasting peace on earth in the name of God and of His Christ. Never was a more presumptuous sin committed; and the reason I make such a statement I now explain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mass of humanity has been alienated from God for more than 6,000 years. In that time men have organized governments and put forth their endeavors to rule the world, but they have done so without authority from Jehovah God. The only nation on earth that God ever* recognized was the nation of Israel, as He so stated; and because of the wrongdoing of that people He cast them off. (Amos 3: 2) Satan had raised the issue that God could have no man to remain faithful to Him. God did not deprive him of the rulership of the world, but has permitted him to carry out his wicked purposes and to exercise his power over men, and at the same time God has had a small number of men in the earth who have resisted Satan and been faithful to God. The invisible ruler of the world for centuries, therefore, has been Satan the Devil. This is plainly proven by the words of Jesus and the apostles, as well as by the extraneous facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(John 12:31; 14: 30;/ 2 Cor. 4:3, 4) Satan is God’s enemy. He mocks and reproaches Him and turns the people away from God. In all this time God has placed before His people His Word of truth and given them an opportunity to believe Him and obey Him. The majority of mankind, however, have been led away under the wicked influence of Satan. And now for an organization composed entirely of imperfect men to boldly announce its purpose and ability to do what only God can do, to wit, establish peace and a righteous rule on the earth, is the grossest presumptuous sin and a blasphemy against the name of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No organization of men ever attempted such a thing until in<sup>:</sup> recent years. The so-called ‘•'Christian” church on earth has not always assumed this arrogant position. Why then this change? and why do we find the clergy in this day have become so bold and arrogant as to announce what they can de ? The reason-is this : We are now in the last days of Satan’s rule as described by the Scriptures and we are at the time for the full establishment of God’s kingdom. Because we are in the last time boldness and arrogance has come to the fore. Concerning this it is written, in 2 Timothy 3:1, 2, 5: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To me it is wholly immaterial whether the United States is in the League of Nations or not. I am not speaking for or against the government’s entering the League. I am interested only in the kingdom of God, which He is setting up. I have no fight with the clergymen as men. My only purpose is to call attention to -the truth as found in God’s Word, that the people may no longer be deceived but that, by ■knowing the truth, they may take their stand on the side of Jehovah, The world is in that great crisis and testing time now, and it is God’s due time to announce the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy attempt to defend their course of political activity by telling the people that Jesus took part in the politics of the world. In the May (1930) issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Forum</span><span class="font4"> Bishop Cannon says: “Christ took an active part in the political life of his day and denounced the political ■ leaders.” There is not one word in the Scriptures to support that statement. When 'Christ stood before Pilate He said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” To His disciples He said: ‘You are not of the world; and because I have chosen you out of the world you are hated.’ He then told them that their work was to go and tell the people of God’s kingdom coming and that His followers should continue to do so<sup>;</sup> until He came. In the twenty-third chapter of Matthew is the record of the denunciation Jesus pronounced upon the clergy and doctors of the law of the Jewish people, and this He did because they had forsaken their covenant, denied the 'Word of God, and had allied themselves with Satan’s organization, and this is exactly what the clergy of Christendom have done in this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In John 8: 44 Jesus told them that they were the sons of the Devil and did his will. In Matthew 21:41-43 He told those clergymen that dabbled in politics that they had rejected God’s kingdom and had brought forth the fruits of Satan’s organization; then added these words : “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” I ask the distinguished bishop to point the people to one single scripture that shows that Jesus had anything whatsoever to do with the politics of His day or with the politics of this world in any other day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is “organized Christianity”, by and through its clergymen, that lias tried to force the United States into the League of Nations. A hundred and forty thousand clergymen put on a week’s campaign for this very purpose. It is this class of clergymen that have connived with the politicians and financiers to put America into the - World Court. It is the same organization of clergymen, together with their allies, that has urged the adoption of the Paris Peace Pact, known as the Briand-Kellogg Treaty and by which it is claimed that lasting peace can be established. It is the same organization, by its clergymen, that has taken the lead in the adoption and enforcement of the Prohibition law, which has led to many sorrows and crimes, all of which is contrary t,p the Word of God and is presumptuous and easts reproach upon God’s holy name. At this point, and in support of the statement that the clergymen indulge in the politics of the world, I read from the public press a dispatch from Washington under'date of May 21, 1930: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was revealed as the largest contributor to the Federal Council of Churches by Representative George Holden Tinkbam (r.), of Massachusetts, in a statement today. He said: “Recent revelations show that John D. Rockefeller, Jr., contributed $35,650 in 1926; $32,717 in 1927; $36,250 in 1928, and $32,500 in 1929—about 10 per cent of the total annual income from all sources.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Assailing the council as in league with international bankers and other interests seeking to link the United States to the League of Nations and its court, Tinkham said: “This organization is lending what influence it possesses to have the United States join the League of Nations, a political and military alliance, and as a first step in this direction it is actively participating in the present movement to have the United States join the permanent court of international justice of the League of Nations, the political subsidiary of the league. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is the religious organization that assumes the name of Christ, calling itself the &quot;Federation of Churches of Christ in America”, attempting to control the polities of the world. The organization attempts to influence the selection of men to public office. It collects large sums of money from great financial giants to accomplish its purposes. It takes the lead in an endeavor to force the adoption of the League of Nations, claiming such to be the expression of God's kingdom on earth and that it will outlaw war and bring lasting peace to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although Jesus commanded His followers to continue to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom, the Federal Council of Churches, speaking by its president some time ago, said: “Wc do not want Christ to come here yet. What we want is a world fit for him to come to. Let us robe the earth with God’s glory in the mental and moral achievements of men, and then Christ can come.” Such statement is arrogant and presumptuous in the most emphatic form. It brings reproach upon the name of God and is for that reason blasphemous and turns many people away from God. Any man may enter politics who desires, and about him I will never say a word. But when men assume to represent God and then openly ally themselves with an organization the enemy of God, the people should know the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The World Court and the Briand-Kellogg Peace Treaty are but side entrances to the League of Nations. The clergy of America, and particularly that organization called the Federal Council of Churches, are taking the lead to put the United States in the World Court and to make it a party to these peace pacts. All of these things are the efforts of men to set up a universal rule on earth and call it God’s kingdom and to carry out their claim to make the earth a fit place to live in, and all of which is clone without authority from God and contrary to His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Why Presumptuous</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the president of the United States take notice. Let the congress of the nation be advised. Let the Federal Council of Churches and all the religious organizations of &quot;Christendom” take heed that the kingdom of God will be fully established without the aid or consent of any of them. Their combined efforts to carry out their proud and arrogant claim will come to naught. God caused His prophet to write concerning an attempt by the nations of the earth to control and rule it by and through a league. Then He caused His prophet to write, in Daniel 2:44: &quot;'And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven, set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is the positive and unqualified statement from Jehovah God that neither the League of Nations nor any other combination of men and governments shall have anything to do with the setting up of His kingdom and establishing peace and righteousness. It is God’s kingdom, and not man’s; and for men to assume to do what God has declared He will do is a gross, presumptuous sin. The nation or organization that attempts to run ahead of God and presumptuously attempts to set up a rule or organization and call it God’s kingdom will suffer severe punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; In 1914 Satan’s rule of the earth without interference came to an end, and from that time forward the process of ousting him and destroying his power has progressed. It was then that God set His King Christ upon His throne and commanded Him to begin operations, which is clearly set forth in Psalm 2: 6 and Psalm 110: 2. There followed a war in heaven, as stated in Revelation 12, and Satan was cast out of heaven to the earth; and since then his operations have been confined to the earth. Since 1914 the woes upon the peoples of ea,rth have been worse than ever before, and the reason is stated in Revelation 12:12 thus: ‘Woe to the inhabiters of the earth; for the Devil is. come clown unto you having great wrath, because he knoweth he hath but a short time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has declared in His Word that the next great act of His King Christ will be the battle of Armageddon, in which Satan’s organization shall be completely destroyed. Satan, knowing that his time is short, puts it into- the minds of the rulers of earth to form a combine called the League of Nations, and employs the clergymen as the chief advocates thereof, and Satan’s purpose is to draw all “Christendom” into the League and turn the people away from Jehovah God, preparatory for Armageddon. The Federal Council of Churches, in advocating the League of Nations, is therefore playing into the hands of Satan. In this their leaders are without excuse, because they should have known and followed the teachings of the-Word of God. Concerning the League of Nations, and its formation and its end, God caused His prophet to write these words: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces: and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought: sneak the word, and it shall not stand.”—Isa. 8~: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God not only puts His stamp of disapproval upon the Federal Council of Churches and its allies, but says to them, ‘That which you have endorsed as the political expression of my kingdom on earth shall be completely destroyed.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statesmen, and financiers of so-called “Christendom” have been deceived and misled by the sophistries of the religious teachers who have falsely prophesied before them. Because the clergy claim to be learned in the Bible and duly authorized to teach it the statesmen and financial leaders of the world have relied upon them. Thereby these have all been drawn into the conspiracy which Satan has formed against God and His kingdom. Concerning that conspiracy God’s prophet writes, in Psalm 2:2, 3 (from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font4">: “The kings of earth take their stand, and grave men have sat in conclave together, against Jehovah and against his Anointed One [saying] : ‘Let us tear apart their bands, and cast away from us their cords I’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who are God’s anointed? Christ Jesus, the King now present, and His faithful followers, who are God’s witnesses. The clergy have tafasi the lead in this conspiracy in this, that thejr have urged the adoption of the League of Nations as a substitute for the kingdom of Christ and have opposed all who teach the truth concerning God’s kingdom. During the past few years there lias been and is today a small company of men and women going throughout the land telling the people of God’s kingdom. They are doing this in obedience to the Lord’s commandments to preach the good news of the kingdom as a witness. The clergymen constantly urge the officers of the law to arrest and punish by fine and imprisonment these faithful witnesses of God, and upon the hypocritical pretext that they are ‘breaking the Sunday law’. The Pharisees charged Christ Jesus with the same crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now let the statesmen, the governors and other officers constituting the rulers hear these words of Jehovah, written in Psalm 2:10. 12 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4">: “Now therefore ye kings, shew your prudence, be admonished, ye judges of earth: kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish by the way, for soon might be kindled his anger. How happy are all who seek refuge in him 1” These words of God’s prophet are repeated here, not as a threat, but as a warning, that the rulers of the land may have their eyes opened and may cast away from them their hypocritical allies who have been misrepresenting God. God will permit no interference with His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The claim that “organised Christianity” is •called upon to establish peace and righteousness on earth is not only presumptuous, but blasphemous against God and His Christ. In the May </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Forum</span><span class="font4"> a bishop is reported as saying these ■words: “The burning problem is not merely the elimination of war but the establishment of a lasting and righteous peace. The time has come for as clear a declaration of the united voices of the church as on slavery or dueling. It is for the church to determine in what circumstances killing is an offense against God and man.” Add to these words the declaration of the former president of the Federal Council of Churches and the action of the organization and we have the presumptuous statement that the church can prevent war and establish a lasting and righteous peace on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I remind you that the nation of Israel was a typical nation, and it is expressly stated in the Bible that it foreshadowed “Christendom” so called. God sent His prophet Jeremiah to tell that people that a great trouble ■ and war was coming upon them and that they should turn to the Lord. Hananiah, a self-appointed prophet, disputed the statement of God’s prophet and urged the people to believe that there would be no war, but lasting peace. The result thereof I quote from Jeremiah 28:15: “Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah, The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.” Then God’s prophet, addressing the false prophet Hananiah, said (vs. 16) : “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will east thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shaft die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord.” Thus God lias declared His purpose of dealing with those who persist in presumptuous sin before Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Matthew 24:14 the commandment is given to God’s people to go and tell the world concerning His kingdom. In obedience to this commandment a small company of Christians are today going from house to house to preach to the people by word of mouth and by exhibiting to them books containing the message of the kingdom. This work will go on until it is done; and when done, Jesus declares, in Matthew 24: 21, 22, there shall come upon the world the greatest war and time of trouble ever known. That will be the battle of Armageddon; and concerning the result of that great trouble, God, through His prophet Jeremiah, says (25:33, 34): “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, ... nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Present Duty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But one may ask: “Is it not now’ the duty of n Christian to try to reform the world and make it better?” The Scriptures answer “No”, because such is an impossibility. The Christian is commissioned to be a witness to the name and word of Jehovah God and to tell the people why distress is in the earth and to serve notice upon the people and rulers of the impending trouble that is about to come to pass and of the blessings of the kingdom that shall follow. That is the only reason for preaching the gospel today by radio, by going from house to house, or by printed publications. The day of God’s vengeance is at hand. The time rapidly approaches when He will express His indignation against, Satan and his wicked organization that has misled and oppressed the people for many centuries. Christ is the Redeemer and Deliverer of the oppressed. He lias already come and His kingdom will bring the relief. Clothed with all power and authority in heaven and in earth He comes to clear the earth of wickedness and to establish a lasting and righteous peace and (as written in Revelation 19:15) “He shall rule them with a rod of iron”. It is written concerning Him that He is “the Prince of Peace and of his government and peace there shall be no end”. Under His reign of righteousness the people will learn righteousness. This is the complete remedy for the ills of humankind. Why even waste time or energy with false methods?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By advocating the League of Nations, the World Court, the International peace pacts, and by participating in the politics of the world, the clergy have brought great reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. They have prostituted true Christianity in order that they might gain popularity. They have sold themselves to the 'Devil that they might win the praise of men. They have misrepresented God and His Word and have turned many honest souls into agnosticism or infidelity. They are proud, haughty, arrogant and austere, and are proceeding without authority, from God and contrary to His Word, and are therefore guilty of presumptuous sin and of blaspheming the holy name of God, and their day of reckoning is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statesmen of the world say: “We will establish lasting peace.” The financial powers say: “We will outlaw war, and bring in peace.” The clergy of the world say: “It is for the church to establish lasting and righteous peace.” All together they say: “We will make the earth a fit place for man and make it safe for him.” At the same time the oppression, sorrow and suffering of the people increase. Even the declaration by the rulers concerning peace and safety is presumptuous in the sight of God. In 1 Thessalonians 5: 3 it is written: “When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction shall come upon them as a woman in travail and they shall not escape.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the people take warning now. Let them provide themselves-with a Bible and the. necessary books or helps to understand it, and then diligently apply themselves to an understanding of God’s Word. Their help can come only through His kingdom. God has given His promise that by and through His kingdom<sup>:</sup> He will bless all the families of the earth that turn to Him. He will faithfully keep that promise.</span></p>

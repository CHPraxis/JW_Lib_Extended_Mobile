<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding tho people to understand Jehovah's purposes. It provides systematic Biblo study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God's revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as tho fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It docs not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, tho Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that ho is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam's wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a tacriflee for man and thereby produced tho ransom price; that Jesus tho divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the icdemptivc price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus ia his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all families of tho earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations nnd peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it is the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give tho testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that the kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel of the kingdom must be preached.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HIS CAMPAIGN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH caused Jesus to speak these words for the instruction of his anointed people on earth after Jesus comes to the temple of God. About this there can be no doubt, because Jesus said: “The Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.” (John 12:49) Those who are in full harmony with Jehovah are now joyfully obeying this commandment given by Jesus. All those who are so doing form a company, which company is engaging in the campaign to the glory of God. All the anointed should have a clear conception of this great campaign, and to help in arriving at a proper conclusion the following is here published.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is engaged in the most important work that is being done on the earth. Those who are associated in this work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font6">not work for any personal or pecuniary gain. With them it is the greatest privilege to engage in this work; hence hours are not counted by them. They do not limit themselves to an eight-hour day. Every other organization under the sun is moved by some selfish reason, either personal or pecuniary, for the work in which they engage, but the Society is carried on for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">unselfish reason.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> All the worldly institutions or organizations are in doubt and perplexity as to what the future holds for them. The Society is not in the slightest doubt as to the results and future. These statements will sound peculiar to some, and therefore an explanation is deemed proper.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">* More than six thousand years ago one of Jehovah’s sons, then called Lucifer, was entrusted with the high office of overseer of earth’s creation including perfect man. Lucifer rebelled against God and turned all of his power to wickedness. He defied Jehovah to put a man on earth who would hold steadfastly to his integrity when put to the most severe test. lie caused man to fall and receive the sentence of death. He continued to reproach God. His name Lucifer was then changed by the Lord, and since then he has been designated in the Bible as Satan, Dragon, Serpent and Devil. God announced his purpose to destroy the wicked one. He could have done so immediately and have started another creation of perfect man on earth. Perfect wisdom took the very opposite course. Before accomplishing the destruction of Satan and his wicked allies, God purposes to let Satan have a full opportunity to prove his challenge, and for that reason Jehovah has not interfered with the Devil in carrying out his wicked schemes, until his own due time arrives. Jehovah did state that he would in his own due time interfere and destroy the wicked one and his works.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> From Eden, and afterwards for a period of more than sixty centuries, Satan has pursued his wicked course unhindered, except occasionally God has caused his own name to be brought prominently before men that they might not entirely forget the Creator. Now the Scriptures and the physical facts show that God's due time is at hand, when he will destroy Satan and his works. Before doing so, however, the Lord will have a special work done in the earth; and that work is now in progress, and the Society herein mentioned is the visible part of God’s organization on earth that is doing that work. This work must be done and must be completed according to the Lord’s commandments. What then is that work, and why is it being done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">°At the time of man’s expulsion from Eden, Jehovah announced that he would bring forward a “seed” through which a righteous government would be established on earth, and by which Satan's wicked organization would be destroyed. Later he made known that this promised “seed” is Christ Jesus his beloved Son, and those associated with him in his work of righteousness. During the past nineteen centuries he has been selecting this “seed”, which work is now about completed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> To redeem man from death it was necessary for Jesus to become a man and die, which he did; and therefore Jehovah raised him out of death and gave him life everlasting as a divine creature. The chii-f purpose of the coming of Jesus to earth was not for the redemption of man, but to deliver a message of truth for Jehovah and incidentally to provide redemption for the human race in furtherance of God’s purpose. He was faithful in the performance of the work assigned to him, and because of his faithfulness Jehovah gave to him, amongst other things, the name of “The Faithful and True Witness”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since Jesus ascended to heaven ; and never again will human eyes behold him, because he is divine. He is clothed with all power in heaven and in earth as Jehovah’s chief officer. The divine promise is that in God’s due time Jesus would return and take over the affairs of the world and rule them in righteousness. In 1914 Jesus Christ was placed upon his throne of authority by Jehovah and began to exercise his kingly power, and this is shown by the physical facts and the Scriptures, to wit: Psalm 110:1-4 and Psalm 2:6. Immediately thereafter a war in heaven took place, with Jesus and his angels on one side, and Satan and his angels on the other side, and Satan was cast out of heaven and down to the proximity of the earth, and his wicked actions are now carried on at the earth. That is the reason there is now such a great increase of crime and wickedness in the earth. It is a condition of darkness and wickedness that immediately precedes the complete overthrow of Satan’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>0</sup> It is hardly necessary to say that the Almighty God has an organization to carry on his work. He is the God of order and everything with him is orderly, and he works through his organization. Christ Jesus is made the chief one in that organization. It was about A.D. 1879 that Christ Jesus began to restore to his faithful followers on earth the truths of the Scriptures that had long been hidden by the wrongful acts of Satan’s representatives on earth. The Scriptures designate this work as “preparing the way before the Lord”. About that same time publication of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> began, and the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was shortly thereafter organized, and since then has been the visible means or channel to communicate between the followers of Christ Jesus concerning his work, and who arc yet on the earth. Without a doubt the Lord directed the formation of the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> From its beginning until 1917 the Society continued to make known the truth to the people concerning God’s purposes. In the year 1917 the World War was on, and a time of great persecution and trial came upon the people of God on earth. The World War furnished the occasion for such persecution and ill treatment. This became so severe that the work of the Society was practically stopped for more than a year. Then the Lord revealed to his people the reason why this work was stopped for a time, and why it was again revived. Since the year 1919 the work of the Society has been going forward with an ever increasing momentum.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> In the 24th chapter of Matthew will be found the great prophecy of Christ Jesus concerning the events that would come to pass at the end of the world. That prophecy was spoken in answer to the question propounded to him by his disciples. He had taught them of his return and of his kingdom, when he would establish righteousness, oust the wicked one, and bless the peoples of the earth. Keenly interested in this, his disciples asked him what would be the sign or proof of his presence and the end of the world. He answered that the beginning of that period of time would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence and other disasters amongst the people. That prophecy began to have its fulfilment in the autumn season of 1914, and that marks the time of the fulfilment of the prophecy in Psalm 2:6, which reads: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill .of Zion. ’ ’ It also marks the fulfilment of Revelation the 11th chapter, verses 17 and 18, which read as follows: “Saying, We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come. ’ ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> There is a correspondency between the second and first comings of the Lord Jesus Christ, and particularly in this respect: Three and one-half years after he began his ministry, to wit, in the year 33 (A.D.), he came into Jerusalem to the temple and offered himself as king to Israel, and began a work of cleansing the temple. Corresponding thereto his second appearing took place in the autumn season of 1914, when he was placed upon his throne, and three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in the spring of 1918, the Lord Jesus appeared at his spiritual temple and began the examination and cleansing thereof. By that temple is meant all of those who are wholly devoted to God and approved by him as the followers of Christ Jesus, and which constitutes the temple of Ged not made with the hands of creatures. (2 Cor. 6:16 ; 1 Cor. 3:16) The coming of the Lord Jesus to the spiritual temple was for examination of his followers and for judgment. The approved ones from that time forward the Lord Jesus has been gathering into his organization, and making them members of the temple class. Those who are members of the temple class and who yet remain on earth are called the “remnant” of the Lord, and are anointed, which means officially appointed to do the work of the Lord on the earth as he commands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> The corporation bearing the name “Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society” was created and organized under the laws of the land to carry on the work therein designated. This, however, is merely a matter of legal organization. The real Society herein mentioned and called the Wateh Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is made up of a company of men and women who are wholly, unselfishly, and completely devoted to God and his cause of righteousness, and who refuse to have any sympathy or cooperation with any part of Satan’s organization. Such have been taken into the covenant with Christ Jesus for his kingdom, and have therefore devoted themselves to the service of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Lord. Therefore, when mention is made herein of the “Society”, the purpose is to include only those who are entirely devoted to God and to his cause of righteousness. The Lord has supplied the testimony to each one, that he may determine whether or not he is a member of God’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> What is the reason for these men and women to be on the earth at this time, and be counted as a part of God’s organization; are they preparing themselves to go to heaven? Jesus gave the answer to that question. Speaking of the faithful ones whom he would find on coming to his temple, he collectively calls them by the name and title of “servant”, or “faithful and wise servant”. His words are: “But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. ’ ’—Matt. 24: 43-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> In this text, when he speaks of his goods, he means the interests of his kingdom, which interests are on the earth. These faithful ones thus mentioned are therefore appointed by him and charged with the duty of doing God’s will on earth. Such is the work in which the Society is now engaged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> What then is the will of God concerning these, and the work that they shall now do? The great event to which Christians have been looking forward since the day of Pentecost has been, and is, the second coming of Christ and the setting up of the kingdom of God under Christ. In his answer to the question as to when that time would begin, Jesus mentioned certain events that would prove its beginning; and these events began to come to pass in 1914. The coming to pass of these events proving that the second presence of the Lord had taken place, and that the kingdom was at hand, constituted and is good news to all who love the Lord God. The word “gospel” means good news; hence the Lord Jesus, speaking to his “faithful and wise servant” class brought together when he comes to his temple, says: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) By these words the Lord outlines clearly a positive work that must be done by those who are of the temple of God and who yet remain on the earth. No Christian could be pleasing to the Lord who would fail or refuse to engage in that work as opportunity is afforded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> From and after 1918 the Lord has been gathering together unto himself these faithful ones, and has been bringing them into a company called the “temple”, or “faithful servant” class, and which are otherwise designated in the Scriptures as the “remnant” of Zion, which is God’s organization. To this “remnant” the Lord commits the obligation and duty of delivering a testimony concerning his kingdom. (Rev. 12:17) These men and women forming this company must be, and will be, obedient to the commands of the Lord, and therefore their service unto the Lord must be and is wholly unselfish. Their work is not for money, not for office, nor for honor or plaudits from men. They work because they love God and love Christ, and rejoice to have some part in the vindication of God’s holy name. All of these that now prove faithful to the end will have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and their course of action will prove that God can and does have some men and women on earth that maintain and hold fast their integrity to him under the most severe conditions. These now go forth to preach the gospel, and “preaching” means telling good news to others; and that is their entire work now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> What is the purpose of having this company of people called the “Society” engaged in preaching the gospel or good news of the kingdom? The real purpose is to serve notice on the rulers and the peoples of the nations of earth, particularly those nations called “Christendom”, of God’s purpose of shortly vindicating his word and name, and to prove to all creation that he is the Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> As soon as this witness work is done in obedience to the commandments of the Lord, then the final end of Satan’s world or organization will be here; and this end will be marked by the great battle of the day of God Almighty, otherwise called the “Battle of Armageddon”, that which Jesus designated as the worst time of tribulation or trouble the world has ever known; and he further states that there will never be another, because that battle will completely destroy Satan’s organization. (Matt. 24:21,22) Then immediately will follow the complete establishment of righteousness in all the earth. The government of Christ will take full control of the affairs of the world, and bring relief to the oppressed and blessings to the obedient.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The work that the Society is now engaged in is therefore kingdom work, because those who go to make up the Society arc declaring the works and the praises of the Almighty God, and informing the people of the great benefit his kingdom will bring. For this reason the work of the Society is now the most important work that is being done on earth. It is God’s work, and therefore it is of the greatest importance. It must be done unselfishly, because no c.ther motive would be acceptable to Jehovah and to the Lord Jesus as the great executive officer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> The work performed by God’s consecrated ones on the earth from A.D. 1879 to 1918 was foreshadowed by the things performed by Elijah the prophet. The Scriptural record is that Elisha was anointed and appointed in the room or place of Elijah to finish the work which Elijah had begun. Both Elijah and Elisha represent God’s chosen people, and represent the same people doing somewhat different work covering different periods of time. In keeping with these pictures, in the year 1918 the work practically came to a stop, which was foreshadowed by Elijah’s being taken away. Something more than a year thereafter the work of God’s consecrated people, by his kind favor, took on a new lease. It was then that the Lord revealed to his people that there was yet much to be done. Those who were unselfishly devoted to God, and anxious to magnify his name, went forward to the work with a zeal peculiar to his house. It was later, to wit, in 1922, that the church saw for the first time that Christ Jesus had come to the temple of God and now all of God’s approved ones must engage in a work of advertising the King and the kingdom as the opportunity to do so was offered them. Consequently the Society’s work was organized for the first time on a more systematic and efficient basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The followers of Christ began to see that God was not merely preparing a people to take to heaven, but was taking out a people for his name, to be his witnesses particularly at the end of the world. It was more clearly seen that “this gospel of the kingdom” must be preached to the nations as a witness before the final end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> To do this work it was necessary to manufacture many books and booklets. To hire all of the printing work would mean a high cost of the product to the people, and therefore make it impossible for the people to have the very message that God purposed they should have. The Society then set about to build printing plants for the manufacture of books and other literature required. The factory was built at Brooklyn and fully equipped with the latest improved machinery for printing and manufacturing books. And now in this factory it is possible to turn out twenty thousand bound books of 36S pages each in one working day. Another factory was built at Magdeburg, Germany, and still another in Bern, Switzerland. These factories provide the publications in the various languages used in Continental Europe and other parts of the earth. The result is that today this gospel of the kingdom is published in as many as thirty-six languages, and the message has been put in the hands of many people in all the lands of so-called “Christendom”. The nations are therefore having the witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Because the work of manufacturing books is done by the hands of men and women who are devoted to God and his cause, and who are not seeking financial gain, and because of exercising the strictest economy in buying the material and manufacturing the literature and books, and above all, because of the blessing of the Lord, these books are published and placed in the hands of the people at a very nominal cost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> The Society now publishes the following clothbound books: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, Prophecy,</span><span class="font6"> Book One and Book Two of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light;</span><span class="font6"> and in addition thereto, the following small books, paper covered: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Lord’s Return, Hell, Where Are the Dead? The Last Days, Prosperity Sure, Oppression, Judgment, Crimes and Calamities,</span><span class="font6"> War </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">or Peace? Prohibition and League of Nations, Talking with the Dead, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, World Distress: Why? Desirable Government, Comfort for the People, Comfort for the Jews, Standard for the People, Freedom for the People, The Peoples Friend;</span><span class="font6"> and additional thereto, publishes </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Totcer</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> all of these containing the message of the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> Since 1922 in particular the work has gone steadily forward and increased every year, and it will be found upon examination of the report for 1930 that it is the best year yet. Nineteen hundred and twenty-nine was a year of material prosperity, comparatively speaking, whereas 1930 has been a year of much depression ; and yet the work of the Lord’s people in proclaiming the message of the kingdom has increased. Every one of the above books was written and published between the years of 1921 and 1930. At the close of the year 1929 the total number of these books that have been placed in the hands of the people in different languages was, to wit, 77,452,360. Add to this number the total of publications placed in the hands of the people for the year 1930, and you will begin to have some conception of the tremendous work that has been done in the past ten years by a few people collectively called the “Society” or God’s “servant”. No man-made organization could possibly accomplish such work. Only the Lord could accomplish this result, and this he has done through his consecrated people, and each one of them has appreciated the privilege now of obeying the Lord and sees that it is the will of God that this gospel of the kingdom must go to the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2T</sup> To be sure, the work must be done orderly, and to this end the organization has been made as nearly perfect as imperfect men can make it, and by the Lord’s grace it is working to his glory. For this reason it is confidently stated that the Society forms a part of God’s organization to carry on his work, and that it is the only visible part of his organization now on the earth. This is not boasting of any man, nor man-made arrangement, but it is boasting in the Lord, because all who arc of the Society realize that by themselves they can accomplish nothing, but by the Lord’s grace and by his spirit his work can and will be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Satan the Devil is the great enemy of God, and therefore the enemy of all who love God and serve him. His purpose and scheme has ever been to keep the people in ignorance of the truth, and to do this he has constantly resorted to fraud and deception. Satan is the god of this world, and by deceiving the masses of the people as well as their leaders, he has builded a powerful organization. His organization constitutes his “seed” because they do his bidding. It is to be expected that this organization of Satan’s would vigorously oppose the proclamation of the truth being made by representatives of Jehovah. The opposition is constantly made manifest, and all doubt of its source disappears when the Scriptures are understood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah points out in his Word that the seed of the serpent is the organization of Satan, made up of wicked spirit creatures which are invisible to man, and the visible rulers of this world, to wit, the commercial, political and religious elements combined, which rule and control the people. Jehovah states in his Word that there would be deadly enmity between the seed of promise and the seed of the serpent. (Gen. 3:15) This enmity could not be made manifest in such a marked degree until God’s “seed” had come into prominence, and until the seed of Satan is arrayed against that seed. The seed of promise began to be made manifest in a marked degree in 1914, when Jehovah placed his beloved Son upon his throne, and the seed of the serpent has shown special enmity against the people of God since that date.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> Jesus stated in plain language that the clergy among the Jews were the offspring of Satan, the Devil. Those were the men that Satan used to persecute and oppose Jesus. The counterpart of those men consists of the clergy of the present day, particularly of the nations called “Christendom”. Added to these are those who have been brought to a knowledge of the truth and who became lawless and joined themselves to Satan’s organization. These are all of the seed of Satan because they are blinded to the truth and permit themselves to be used to oppose those who are feeding the truth to the people, and by their opposition these help to keep the people in darkness. Those who received a knowledge of the truth from and after 1879 and who did not receive the love of the truth became lawless. To receive the love of the truth means that one must be unselfishly devoted to Jehovah’s cause. One who has a selfish motive in serving Jehovah, such as a selfish desire to get to heaven and help to rule the universe and shine, could not be entirely devoted to God's cause.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> All such who have refused to obey the commandments of the Lord to preach this gospel of the kingdom, and who have set themselves in opposition to such work, have fallen easy victims to Satan, and have been the most violent opposers of the work of the Society. Thej' are better equipped to oppose, because their wits have been sharpened. Tins opposition to the work of the Society is one of the best evidences that the Society’s work is of the Lord and has the Lord’s approval, and here arc submitted some Scriptures in support of that conclusion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> Satan reproached and defamed God’s name from the very beginning of man’s history. He has ever been a slanderer of God, and his name Devil signifies that he is a slanderer. He has laid malicious charges and slanders against Jehovah at all times. When Jesus came to earth to do the work that God sent him to do. it is written concerning him, “The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69: 9) A reproach is a malicious slander placed against the good name and work of another, the object being to do injury both to the creature and to the work. Those who have become the obedient children of God and have put forth their best endeavors to faithfully serve God and follow in the footsteps of Jesus have been and are subjected to the same reproaches or persecutions that fell upon Jehovah and upon Christ Jesus. “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” (Hom. 15: 3) These also are slandered by the Devil and his representatives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>33</sup> To his faithful followers Jesus gave warning in these words: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 15:18-20) Without a question of doubt Jesus spoke these words for the encouragement of those who would be faithfully following in his footsteps; and knowing these truths, those who are privileged to be a part of the Society, or God’s visible organization, do not permit slanders or reproaches to retard their efforts in doing the Lord’s work. Rather they take these things as a proof from the Lord that they are doing his work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>34</sup> That the true and faithful followers of Jesus might be encouraged to go on in the face of opposition, it is further written in his Word: “In the world ye shall have tribulation.” (John 16:33) “We must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) “For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.” (Phil. 1:29) “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.” (2 Tim. 2:12) As a further encouragement it is written for these: “If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.”—1 Pet. 4:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> In harmony with these texts, God’s true people forming the Society love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, but their love is wholly devoted to Jehovah and his righteous kingdom. These are for Christ and his kingdom, and they appreciate what the Lord has stated in his Word, that all that arc against his work are anti-Christ or anti-kingdom, and therefore anti-God. This includes those who once claimed to serve God and who fell away. Those who continue faithful and true see the organization of Satan arrayed against the organization of Jehovah God. They clearly sec the issue and delight to have their stand on the side of the Lord and to proclaim his message. To such the Lord through his Word says: “Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.” (1 John 2:20) This means that they are appointed and anointed of God to do his work, and they know all the things that pertain to the issue. They see the evil organization on one side, and the righteous organization on the other, and are determined by God’s grace to go on in the proclamation of his truth, regardless of all opposition. For this reason they are diligently engaging in preaching this gospel of the kingdom, and because of their faithfulness in so doing, are being persecuted; and that persecution is coming from those who claim to be Christians but who are not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> Both the Scriptures and the physical facts therefore concur in proving that the Society, otherwise called the “servant”, constitutes the visible representative of the Lord’s kingdom on earth at this time, and therefore a part of his visible organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3T</sup> Furthermore, the Society is not trying to get converts or to build up an organization by taking in members. Its sole mission is to preach this gospel of the kingdom, and thereby to advise the people that Jehovah is the only true God and that his kingdom is the only remedy for the many ills of humankind. The Society teaches the people the truth, and nothing else but the truth. This being the work that the Lord has commanded must be done, everyone who has faith in him will know that the work will continue until his will is accomplished.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COURAGEOUS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> ‘ ‘ Courage ’ ’ means to confidently go forward in an assigned duty or work, knowing that there is serious opposition in the way, but at the same time relying implicitly on the power that is behind the work assigned. During the year the remnant has been showing real courage. These know that Jehovah is with them in the campaign. They confidently rely upon the Lord, and are of good courage regardless of any danger or opposition. They appreciate the promise of Jehovah, that he will furnish all the needed protection, “Because he [the remnant or servant] hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.” —Ps. 91:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> During the year the opposition has increased, but this has not at all dampened the ardor or beat down the courage of God’s faithful ones. Much opposition has been manifested by the clergy of so-called “organized Christianity”, and these have instituted their bitter opposition against the remnant. This is exactly as the Lord foretold it would be, because Satan is mad at God’s organization and seeks the destruction of the remnant of her seed. (Rev. 12:17) The clergy have caused the arrest of many of the brethren, and numerous cases have had to be tried in the courts. The brethren have been charged with the breaking of the Sunday law or with selling goods and merchandise without a license.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> To be sure, these charges are false, but they are made just the same; and those against whom they are laid are reminded that Jesus also was falsely charged. He also says to his faithful ones, ‘The servant is not greater than the master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.’ None of the Lord’s workers are peddlers in any sense. These workers are not doing a commercial business at all, and surely none that is in any wise in competition with anyone else. Everyone who loves the Lord and serves him delights to welcome everyone else to engage in the same thing. They are not attempting to make money, nor seeking members of an organization, but are devoting themselves exclusively to carrying out the commandments of Jehovah. As God’s children they are authorized and commissioned to preach the gospel regardless of any day. It has always been customary in America to preach the gospel on Sunday. It is wholly inconsistent to arrest anyone who is going about proclaiming God’s kingdom on the day called Sunday. Of course, we know this is the result of the laws of the organization of this world. That opposition and persecution must of necessity come, that the faithful ones might have tribulation. However, these questions must be fought out, because it is surely the Lord’s will that his servants shall not lie supinely on their backs when persecuted, and fail to go on in the witness work. Having full confidence in God they press forward in the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Sometimes when one is putting forth his best endeavor to serve, and is tired and worn and weary, and then is held up by some officer and dragged into court, he may wonder why God permits such persecution and opposition. But is it not true that this opposition draws the attention of the people to God’s witnesses, and this makes them a spectacle or a witness for the Lord? The remnant realize that the Lord is at the head of this campaign, and knows all about the opposition, and can break it to pieces at any time he sees fit. The fact that he permits it to go on must be for some good purpose for the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> With full confidence and with renewed courage, the remnant press on and do the work. They are determined to go forward with it until it is done, regardless of any or all opposition. Those who love the Lord realize that they must be obedient to “the higher powers”, and “the higher powers” means Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and such other parts of God’s organization to which he has committed the direction of his work, such as the apostles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Warned of opposition and knowing it will come, the faithful are not surprised when it does come. Surely the Lord must have caused Peter long ago to write these words for the benefit and encouragement of those who are now going about preaching the gospel of the kingdom. ‘‘Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God rcsteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.”—1 Pet. 4:12-14.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE PEOPLE’S GREATEST NEED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE people of every country are in dire need. A few have an abundance of money and property, but they are not happy or satisfied. The masses have not sufficient to feed and clothe the body, and everywhere discontent continues to grow. All are in perplexity and distress because they can sense some calamity about to fall upon the world and have no knowledge of what it is or how to escape it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is just ahead the greatest time of trouble the world has ever known, and before that time of trouble falls upon the people of earth the Lord has given command to his faithful followers that they must bear the message of truth to the people concerning it. Among other things, these witnesses are specifically commanded to proclaim to the people that Jehovah is the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These indisputable facts show that the greatest need of the peoples now is a knowledge of what is the truth. If they understand the truth the people can see the way to turn in order that they might best conserve their own interests. Every great and good thing is born amidst much tribulation. Faithful men and women are now calling at yow homes to tell you of the truth and where you may find it. They are telling you of the coming relief and blessings. and this message is being vigorously opposed. Like all other good things, it meets with strenuous opposition from those who are against the general welfare of mankind. The entire situation as we now observe it was long ago foretold by the holy prophets of (Ltd, and the time has come to understand those prophecies and the people must be told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah caused his prophet to foretell the reason why his witnesses must now give testimony before the peoples of the world that ho is the Almighty God. The enemy and his agents would have the people believe that requiring the giving of testimony that Jehovah is God shows selfishness and weakness on God’s part; selfishness, because, say they, he desires the honor that the people would confer upon him by giving him praise; weakness, in this, that he fears all creation will forsake him. Such conclusions are entirely wrong and are indeed wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God could not be selfish, because “God is love’’, which means that he is the perfect expression of unselfishness. He never did anything for a selfish reason, but always for the good of his creatures. His great unselfishness and perfect love were specifically shown when he gave his beloved Son to be put to death as a sacrifice that men might live. In this great act, the apostle truly says, Jehovah made a gift for mankind that cannot be fully valued: “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.” (2 Cor. 9:15) This for ever disproves that there is selfishness on Jehovah’s part in having the witness given. No power could exist or be. exercised except by the permission of Jehovah, because he is the Author and Creator of heaven and earth, and all power is in his hands. It is therefore impossible for God to fear that anything would be taken away from him. All the facts show that he acts for the vindication of his name and for the benefit of his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries Satan has attempted to prove to all others of creation that he is equal to Jehovah God; and for this reason he has attempted to duplicate and has counterfeited the principal parts of God’s purposes revealed to man. Satan, by reason of his fraud and misrepresentations, has succeeded in turning the masses of the people away from God. Jehovah has not interfered with Satan’s attempt to exalt himself; but, unless he did interfere at some time, almost all men would be for ever destroyed. Satan has never been able to give life to man, and never could do so. Jehovah God is the fountain of everlasting life. Ged alone can give everlasting life to his creatures. But he will not force life upon them. He provides life as a gracious gift, and then brings man to a knowledge of his purposes that man may have an opportunity to accept or not. Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.—Rom. 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No man could accept a gift without knowledge of the gift and the giver. Therefore if man is ever to receive life everlasting he must know God and know that he is the gracious Giver. The time comes for God to halt Satan in his nefarious course, in order that man, unhindered, may have an opportunity to receive the gift of life. God announces his purpose to destroy Satan and his wicked works, to the end that all willingly obedient ones may have life everlasting in a state of happiness. Before that time of destruction, however, God causes a campaign of education to be carried on in the world for the purpose of informing the people what he intends to do for their good. He will not take action secretly and without giving notice. He will have the people told of his purpose, and then he will demonstrate to them his supreme power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of the witnessing, or the campaign of education, may therefore be briefly stated as this: To enlighten the people by opening their blind eyes, and to enable the “prisoners” to sec that there is to be a relief for them, and that all may know the only one and true way to life everlasting in happiness. To do this it is necessary to tell the people what constitutes God’s organization and what constitutes Satan’s organization, and why the one is opposed to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long centuries ago God caused his prophet to write and foretell that a time would come when a campaign of education would be carried forth in the earth, and that this would be done by his “servant” in whom Jehovah delights: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold ; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles [nations].” (Isa. 42:1) Furthermore, God says to his witnesses or servants: “I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles: to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. ’ ’—Isa. 42: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be observed from this prophecy' that at the time of its fulfilment there are blind people whose eyes must be opened, and that there are prisoners in the prison-houses who must have an opportunity to be relieved. The prophecy must have a fulfilment, because it is uttered under the direction of Jehovah by his prophet upon whom he has placed his approval. The student will look for the physical facts showing a fulfilment of this prophecy, and, if it is in course of fulfilment, he will be able to discern who are the prisoners and who are they that are blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PRISONERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been suggested that the grave is “the prison” and that the dead are in “the prison house”. That conclusion is clearly incorrect. The Scriptures show that the prisoners groan and cry unto God for help, and he hears them. Bead people do not groan and cry. They are unconscious and know not anything, wailing in the grave for God’s due lime to awaken them out of death. (Feel. 9:5,10; Ps. 115:17) A prison is a place where men are held in restraint of personal liberty. Thus a man may be hold behind iron bars, or he may be held in restraint by fear and for that reason be unable to exercise his liberty. “The fear of man bringeth a snare.” (Prov. 29:25) A prisoner held by reason of coercion that puts him in fear is just as truly a prisoner as one who is physically restrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptural proof is now here submitted, showing that the ‘prison-houses’ mentioned by the prophet consist of organized systems of religion, and particularly so-called “organized Christianity’’. There are many congregations, symbolically called ‘houses’, both Catholic and Protestant, all of which have taken the name of Christian, but which in fact show by their course of action that the organizations are anything but Christian. The worship in those houses or congregations is formalism. The worshipers bow down before images and go through forms of worship, which is contrary to the Word of God. They draw near to the Lord with their lips only, but there is no heart devotion to the Lord. They magnify men and go through a ceremony that, instead of reflecting honor upon the Lord, brings reproach upon his name. God is pleased only with those who worship him in spirit and in truth. (John 4:23,24) Formalism is an abomination in the sight of the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Israelites fell away to idolatry and formalism, and their course was prophetic, foretelling how professed spiritual Israel would fall away from God and into idolatry. God commanded that no graven image should be made: “Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am the Lord your God.’’—Lev. 26:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The formalism that is practiced in so-called “organized Christianity’’ comes clearly within the definition of graven images. (Isa. 44:9; 29:13; 2 Tim. 3:1-5) For that reason such become a part of Babylon, or the Devil’s religion, because the purpose is not to honor Jehovah’s name but to build up an organization that dishonors his name and turns the people away from him. The ecclesiastical systems are therefore the prison-houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief prison-keeper, or warden, is Satan himself, because he has by fraud obtained control of the organization called “Christian”. In each congregation of these ecclesiastical organizations there is a shepherd, or watchman, otherwise called “pastor”. These men, who are clergymen, call themselves the shepherds of the flock, or the clergymen of the flock. Each one looks to his own congregation for support. By their course of action they prove that they do not love God and Christ and his kingdom, because they give allegiance and support to the League of Nations, which is the Devil’s makeshift. They otherwise participate in the polities of this world, and are more interested in what they call civic affairs than in telling of God’s great purpose and his kingdom. They refuse to hear the testimony of his Word, and therefore they are blind to what the Lord God is really doing at this time. Not only do they refuse to hear, but they put forth their best endeavors to prevent their congregations from hearing. These clergymen are like their counterpart, the Pharisees, to whom Jesus said: “Woe unto you, lawyers [doctors] ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.”—Luke 11: 52; Matt. 23:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lawyers, the Pharisees, the politicians and the commercial leaders stood together amongst the Jews. Today the politicians and the commercial powers support the “doctors of divinity”, so called. Not only are they themselves blinded to the truth and refuse to hear it, but they take every action within their power to prevent members of their congregations from hearing the truth. The clergymen and the principal of their flocks are blind guides, and, as Jesus said, they will fall into the ditch.—Matt. 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is these clergymen who are local prison-keepers. Probably in every one of the denominational organizations, called a church, and in every congregation thereof, there are those who do love God and who are anxious to know about him and to obey him. But because of the influence of the clergymen and “the principal of the flock ’ ’ they are not permitted to freely discuss the Bible in the church meetings, and are discouraged from going anywhere else to get a knowledge of it. In fact, it is in a verj<sup>r</sup> few of these organizations that there is any Bible study. The clergy do not talk about the Bible. In fact, the modern clergymen deny that the Bible is God’s Word of truth. If the attention of these clergymen is called to some book that gives instruction in the Bible and sets forth the Scriptural proof of God’s purpose, the clergymen strongly denounce the book and ask their congregations to have nothing to do with it. The clergymen claim to be the only ones authorized to interpret the Bible. The result is that the people in those congregations are in darkness concerning the true teaching of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The congregation observes that the pastor or clergyman devotes his sermons to worldly politics, science so called, civic affairs and social matters, but never docs he give them any food from the Word of God that establishes the faith of the people in God and in his purpose of salvation. If it is suggested that members of the congregation go elsewhere to hear the truth, the clergyman vehemently opposes this, saying that if they withdraw from the church they will be doing an evil work and will therefore participate in wrecking society, and that they will find their own eternal destiny in torment. A “great multitude” of good people are thereby held in fear and restraint in the denominational organizations called “churches”. As the prophet foretold, they have a superstitious fear of God but that fear toward God “is taught by the precept of men”.—Isa. 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God foretold through his prophet that the clergymen, or shepherds, would come to a time when they would not feed the congregation but would feed themselves, and he expressed his decided disapproval of such. Israel was a typical people foreshadowing organized Christianity of this day. The Lord caused his prophet to write foretelling these conditions in these words: “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds, Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have yc bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. Therefore, 0 ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. For thus saith the Lord God, Behold I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.”—Ezek. 34:2-4, 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of good will in these church organizations see that there is no longer any truth taught to the congregation by the clergymen nor by the principal of the flock. When the congregation assembles it is chiefly for the purpose of exhibiting the fine clothes of some and listening to a discourse that has no reference to God’s Word. Therefore there are hungry souls in the denominational church systems who are in great distress because of the condition they see there existing. God, through his prophet foretells this condition, and puts in the mouth of those in the congregation who are of good will this prayer: “Help us, 0 God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.” (Ps. 79: 9) They know that the name of God is not honored in the congregation; and they know that the people on the outside, commonly called heathen, look with disgust upon the profession of the clergymen, well knowing that they are hypocrites and that their claim to represent God is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet then represents these honest “prisoners” as saying: “Wherefore should the heathen [those outside of the church systems] say, Where is their God?” They sigh and cry because of this condition, and the prophet represents them further praying: “Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that arc appointed to die; and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, 0 Lord. So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever; we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.”—Ps. 79:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy shows that the prisoners are alive, but that they are “appointed to die”; and thereby they are definitely identified. All who have made a consecration to do God’s will, and who have been accepted in the name of Jesus and taken into the covenant of sacrifice with him, must die as human creatures and be raised out of death as spirit creatures, if they live at all. Therefore they are “appointed to die” by reason of the covenant made. Those who willingly and joyfully separate themselves from the worldly religious systems, in obedience to the Lord’s commands (2 Cor. C: 16-18), also must die; but they are not held prisoners. Feeding upon the Word of God, they have become strong and have left the prison-houses, and have been brought into Zion. Many of such were once “captives” to Babylon, or the Devil-captured system, but they came away and rejoiced. (Ps. 126:1-3) But those consecrated ones who remain in the denominational systems and are held there by being put in fear or by restraint, are held as prisoners; and these are they who cry for relief. God’s great Prophet then shows that this class is the “great multitude” who must pass through the time of trouble and wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb and thereby receive God’s approval, and that then “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ’ ’. They will not be of the royal family of heaven, but they will serve “before the throne of God”.— Rev. 7:11-17; Zech. 14:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The facts are that in the denominational church organizations, both Catholic and Protestant, there are today many souls hungry for the truth, and yet the clergymen or prison-keepers do their best to keep them from knowing the truth. In their distress these prisoners pray unto God: “I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried unto thee, 0 Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.”—Ps. 142: 4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through his prophet God foretells of a time when he would hear the cries of these prisoners and send relief, and then shows that the time that such relief would be sent would be after the building up of Zion. This proof shows a work that the temple class, God’s witnesses, must do, and one reason for giving the witness: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death. ’ ’—Ps. 102:16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has, just at the right time, brought the radio into action, which permits the people to remain in their homes and listen to a proclamation of the truth, regardless of the opposition of the prison-keepers, the clergy. Knowing this, the clergymen unite with Big Business to control the radio and, if possible, to prevent the truth from being broadcast. The Lord has also provided a great number of books explaining the Bible, and his faithful witnesses go from house to house and put these in the hands of the people that the prisoners may have some food. The prophet shows then that God will open the prison doors by giving those who honestly seek the truth an opportunity to hear and know him. “Praise ye the Lord . . . , which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: which executeth judgment for the oppressed; which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners; the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord lovcth the righteous. ’ ’—Ps. 146:1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proof shows, therefore, that the consecrated ones in the denominational church organizations who desire to know God and his Word are hungry and in distress, and that they cry for help; and that the clergy are the prison-keepers who render no help.and concerning whom God says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more. ’ ’—Ezek. 34:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And then God, through his prophet, shows how he will bring relief to the prisoners by giving them a knowledge of the truth. Through his prophet God says he will send his “servant” or “witness” to tell them the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is one of the reasons why the testimony of the truth of God’s Word must now be given by the “servant” class; and that work is now progressing in fulfilment of prophecy. That is the reason why faithful men and women go from house to house with books that explain the Bible, and place them in the hands of the people at a nominal cost. That is the way they preach the gospel, because it is God’s appointed way. The effect of giving the testimony by radio, by books and by other means, is to separate or divide the people. It brings the honest persons of good will, who want to serve God, out from those who are hypocrites. It is neither the purpose, nor the result, to get anyone to join an organization; but the testimony is given to enable them to get their eyes opened and to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. God having commanded this testimony to be given to the prisoners, his witnesses must deliver the testimony; otherwise they could not be pleasing to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are millions of people of good will in the world who are no part of Satan’s organization but who are under the influence and control of that oppressive organization. They are not held in the church prison-houses, but are on the outside. They see the hypocrisy in the churches and hold themselves aloof therefrom. They are blind to the truth, however, and Satan has caused their blindness. (Isa. 42:7; 2 Cor. 4:3,4) It is God’s purpose that such persons may have an opportunity to learn the truth and have their eyes, which means their understanding, opened to enable them to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and against the Devil. Jehovah, through his prophet, foretold that he would make provision for this work, and he has made provision for it. Bj’ his prophet he foretold that he would make an everlasting covenant with Christ, his beloved Son, and that others would be brought into that covenant, and that the ones faithful to that covenant should be members of his “servant” class that is approved.—Isa. 55:1-3; 42:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That he provides these witnesses to do a work for the benefit of the people is made clear. Through his prophet he said: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isa. 55:4) These words of the prophet apply primarily to Jesus Christ, who declared that he came into the world that he might be a witness to the truth. They apply.to all who are in Christ, which includes those who arc in the temple and therefore of Zion. The last members of The Christ on earth arc therefore designated by Jehovah as his ‘witnesses to the people’, and the obligation laid upon them is made plain. Under the supervision of the great Witness, Christ Jesus, these are to be made, and are made, “a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant constitute the “feet of him”, the great Witness, and are therefore of Zion and in the temple and, being yet on earth, are standing at the very borders of God’s glorious kingdom. These are God’s watchmen, and he speaks of them as being placed upon the walls of Jerusalem, which represents the organization of his people on earth; and then through his prophet he says of and concerning them: “I have set watchmen upon thy walls, 0 Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence.”—Isa. 62:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant or servants of God must continue to give the witness, even unto the time of entering the kingdom. The entrance therein is symbolized by the “gates”, and, addressing the servant class who are his witnesses, Jehovah says: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With their faces toward the heavenly kingdom the faithful witnesses are pointing the people to the right way. These faithful ones are ‘preparing the way of the people ’ by telling them the reason for their bl ind-ness and oppression, and of God’s gracious provision to release them from their burdens and to show them the way to endless life. This is not an effort to convert the world, such as the clergy have pretended that they could do, but it is a campaign of education, informing the people according to God’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witnesses are commanded to “lift up a standard for the people”. A standard means a guidon or staff to which the people may rally and identify themselves with a specific side. The standard to be lifted up for the people is God’s standard concerning salvation and his government of righteousness. The people must be told that Satan is the real enemy of mankind and that Jehovah is man’s true and everlasting Friend. This must be done in order that all the people of good will may have opportunity to take their stand on the side of the Lord God and under his standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people’s greatest need, therefore, is a knowledge of God and his kingdom under Christ which will bring to them complete relief and everlasting blessing. In bringing to you God’s message of truth these witnesses are making a fight for you. Let all those people of good will who love righteousness and hate wickedness cast away the shackles that bind and hold them in some selfish organization; let them take a bold and fearless stand on the side of Jehovah and no longer hold to man-made theories that dispute the Word of God. Let them joyfully and gladly accept the truth. The day of deliverance is at hand, and every one who seeks the truth and obeys it by walking in the way of righteousness shall be for ever blessed and the good name of Jehovah God will be for ever vindicated.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark13"></a>LETTERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“YOUNG MEN” IN JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thank you for your encouraging letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole condition in Japan is very critical socially and financially. About eight millions are out of work here. Many stores and corporations are closing every day. The government does not know how to handle the present situation. More troubles are arising in Korea also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More books are going out to the people, who are very hungry for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">something.</span><span class="font5"> More new ones are coming into colporteur service. There were thirteen in the field fifty days ago, but now there are twenty-five in Japan and six in Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is surely wonderful to see that these new ones or “young men’’ can understand the present truth by new light which comes through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> every month. “Young men” can understand the new light and appreciate it far better than “old men”. So they sing the new song to the honor of Jehovah God with such a great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely the Lord is blessing us with revealment of his own purposes toward us one by one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A class was organized at Ina, of Nagano province, two months ago. Five men and four women symbolized their consecration. Four (two men and two women) have already entered into the colporteur service. Besides these, three more applied for entering.

<p><span class="font5">We moved into our new office. The work in Japan and Korea is progressing very finely under the Lord’s guidance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INSPIRES TO LOVE AND SERVE JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have finished the first reading of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> with profit and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The amazing thing is the simplicity of the explanations. No labored argument is used in the presentation, and the reader is not required to stretch his imagination to understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is indeed a revelation pleasing and satisfying, and well named </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font5"> Its simplicity is as gripping as the explanations are satisfying, and urges the reader to read on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no room for argument or controversy, for the physical facts are placed alongside of the scriptures, and fulfilled prophecy is apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Revelation has been looked upon as being such a mysterious book, this simple presentation may stumble some who may be inclined to hold to previous interpretations; but God is his own interpreter and he will make it plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Truth, however, when due to be understood is not complex, but simple; it is error that is complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Truly it throws a flood of light upon the pathway of the church, and in calm, forceful and convincing language proclaims the doom of the archoppressor Satan and his organization visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It magnifies the name and word of Jehovah God, and helps us to better understand some of the purposes of the great Eternal One, man's best friend and greatest benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It draws out our hearts’ affections to him, and inspires a greater desire to love -him more and serve him better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is meat in due season for the household of faith, and a fitting climax to the books thus far written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I thank and praise Jehovah for your noble example of loyalty and steadfastness, your unswerving devotion to truth and righteousness, your uncomprising attitude to all that is antiGod and anti-Kingdom, and your fearlessness in the proclamation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this is a stimulus to me, and, I am sure, to many otlu-r--.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With gratitude and thanksgiving to Jehovah, and with increasing desire to press forward, and with Christian love and greetings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother and colaborer by the Lord’s grace,</span></p>

Y., Wednesday, October 1, 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 288</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Your Money’s Worth”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N THIS 285-page book, published by the Macmillan Company (New York), we have a most interesting study in the waste of the consumer’s dollar. The announcement of the book says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The consumer of today is Alice, in a Wonderland of high-pressure salesmanship. With everything advertised as the best, how—except through the wasteful process of trial and error—is the consumer ever to determine the best ? The consumer is under mounting pressure, directed by ever increasing astuteness on the part of the advertiser, to buy, buy, buy—while no means are offered him whereby he may use intelligent selection in his buying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the purpose of this book to explore the wonderland of advertising and salesmanship and to indicate a path that may lead out of it to the solid ground of fact. The first part of the book analyzes, with a great wealth of concrete data, the plight of the average consumer; the second part describes existing scientific agencies, such as the United States Government Bureau of Standards, for the impartial testing of available goods, and proposes a way out. Untold billions can be saved if knowledge can be substituted for sales forcing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Until we read this book we did not know that some prunes are dipped in glucose to make them shiny and so add to their market appeal; nor did we know that the “Listerine” which is supposed to guard our throats and nasal passages, sweeten our breath and kill our dandruff, is so exceedingly mild in its antiseptic properties that it would take $495 worth of it to equal the antiseptic value of a cent’s worth of corrosive sublimate or 33c worth of carbolic acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of us knew that about everything today has the endorsement of this or that actress, but perhaps did not know that the Famous Names, Inc., of Chicago, New York and Hollywood, is in the business of providing endorsements for anything the advertising man wants to have endorsed. The fees run as high as $2,500. Queen Marie, of Rumania, was one of the celebrities whose endorsements were for sale at a price, fixed by Famous Names, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Did you know that rice wholesaling at 7c a pound becomes puffed rice at 61c a pound; wheat wholesaling at 2|c a pound becomes puffed wheat at 68c a pound; and corn at l^c a pound becomes corn flakes at 20c a pound? Funny; isn’t it? And expensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The state architect of New York, Mr. Sullivan Jones, declares that “on the average not less than twenty-five cents in every dollar the consumer pays for building materials goes to meet the cost of selling him. The net result is in general the substitution of one product for another. We are paying 100 percent more for our building materials than we need to—the price of competition”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you want to buy rubbing alcohol put up in attractive form it will cost you up to $1.50 a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">quart;</span><span class="font8"> but when several universities got together and bought five carloads the price was 25c a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gallon.</span><span class="font8"> All depends on who buys and how they buy; doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prices on liquid soap vary from 8c to $2.75 a gallon. Quite a difference; isn’t it? Gillette safety razors used to sell for $5.00; now they can be had at Woolworth stores at 10c. When bicycles were selling at $100 each all the metal parts together cost less than $3.65. All the hard rubber parts of a $2.75 fountain pen cost less than 11c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most deodorants are paraffin oil at 20c a gallon, with 2 percent of pine oil added, making a total cost of 22c a gallon. It sells for $2.50 a gallon. Carbon tetrachloride, an effective grease solvent, a clothes-cleaning and moth-killing agent, and a fire-extinguishing liquid, may be bought at wholesale at 8c a pound. It sells at 90c a pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The best conceivable soap can be sold at 10c a pound. The medication in any medicated soap is so small as to add nothing of value. The treated soap may actually be less efficient as an antiseptic than a pure soap unmedicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“One dollar starts you on the road to health” when you buy a pint of a certain mineral oil, but if you bought the same oil at wholesale you could get a gallon of it for 70c. Naphtha soap chips never contained enough petroleum distillate to be effective as a cleansing agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The A. &amp;&nbsp;P. Company put out an A. &amp;&nbsp;P. Sweet Milk Chocolate which was improperly so branded. The government found it excessive in the amount of cocoa shells ground into it and compelled its destruction after the fats it contained had been recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sanatogen was boosted to the skies, but “laboratory analysis showed that one dollar’s worth of wheat flour contains as much energy as $197 worth of Sanatogen”. You have all heard about Bell-ans. The American Medical Association says of it: “Bell-ans (Pa-pay-ans, Bell) possesses the virtues—and they are few—and the limitations—and these are many—inherent in a mixture of baking soda, ginger and charcoal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the same time that the Royal Baking Powder Company was warning the public against the use of phosphate baking powders and claiming that cream of tartar was the only healthful ingredient it was engaged in manufacturing and selling in Canada, through a company controlled by it, a phosphate baking powder known as “Magic Baking Powder”, and owned 49 percent of the capital stock of a corporation engaged in the manufacture of phosphate for use in baking powders, sold to the manufacturers of phosphate baking powders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One manufacturer stocks 2500 varieties of women’s handkerchiefs. The buyer would have a better chance if there were but twenty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A beautiful but simple electric reading-lamp stand was a failure when sold at $3, but when dressed up with dust-catching gewgaws that added nothing to its value, it sold readily at $15. There are 278,000 types of men’s sack suits, 6,000 varieties of single-bit axes, and 78 sizes of bed blankets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the best possible floor wax use -J pound beeswax, 1 pound paraffin, | pint raw' linseed oil, Id pints turpentine. Melt the beeswax and the paraffin, add the linseed oil and turpentine, and stir* the mixture thoroughly and vigorously. Unfinished wood will be darkened somewhat by this wax as a result of the absorption of the linseed oil. Use hot water, not flame, as a source of heat in making the wax, to avoid the risk of igniting the turpentine. The mixture will cost around 25c a pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are some of the items we gleaned from a hasty scanning of the book. The careful reader will find much more. The work is the product of experiences of two observant men in the Federal Trade Commission and the National Bureau of Standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Many Wonderful Works” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph Levens</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE enclosed advertisement, boosting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Community Chest, clipped from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer,</span><span class="font8"> Cincinnati, May 7, 1930, speaks pretty loudly for itself, as to truthfulness. I have no way of knowing what methods have been taken to make collections for the Community Chest in Cincinnati, but in a certain town in Ohio one party at least (who was already drawing a salary of $50 a week) was given $60 a week for his remuneration for collecting or boosting the collection of the Community funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A lady in this town was one of ten engaged in the collecting who got $100 a month as collector, and she was rated as possessor of property valued at over $450,000. After having the injustice of the situation pointed out to her, and also after asking the management of the funds to give assistance to a needy family, and being met with the reply, “We have nothing for them,” she withdrew as a collector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The employees of a certain business house had been liberal contributors two years ago, but when some of these same contributors, out of work and hard up, w’ere refused assistance when they needed it, they changed their minds as to its efficiency; so when the collectors came soliciting last year they were unceremoniously shown the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The organizer’s generous share is what these thieves are after. “Charity” (LOVE) of the other fellow’s goods is the incentive, not What can I do to help? (Note the squibs: “Shelter the homeless—through the Community Chest”; and on the reverse side, “Correct the causes of crime—through the Community Chest.” This was repeated in another column. Also the white heart on black ground, with the legend,—“Your Community Chest furnishes wholesome outlets to the energies o:f youth; helps to make our-boys and girls better citizens. SHARE!”)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">......Workers in Linoleum Industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TjMG-URES of the department of commerce J-<sup>1</sup> show that from 1927 to 1929 the average worker in a linoleum factory increased his output from $4,330 to $5,368. Of this amount $1,038 went as increased income of the proprietor, and $19 went to the worker himself. Pondering this unequal split of profits, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font8"> says very truly that “higher wages and shorter hours are the only salvation of a machine age”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Ode to the Lawyer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the author of &quot;Ode to the Milkman”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8">S YOU finally walk out of the lawyer’s office it is not likely that you will think there is much </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ode.</span><span class="font8"> to the lawyer. And this is not without some foundation in fact; for that gentleman, having acquired a knowledge of law, and having also, from the experience of his own and of others, acquired the knowledge of how to get around it, sees the psychology of his position and uses it to advantage—to selfish advantage, according to his own individual propensities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A thorough knowledge of law does not make a lawyer. The ideal condition is one where all know the law “from the least of them unto the greatest”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A lawyer is a ‘practitioner in the pleading of law’. A judge may be said to be a ‘practitioner in the administration of law’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Law has to do with the regulation of human conduct, in order that society may live equitably and at peace. Today, law is classed as civil, criminal or international law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Civil law contemplates the rights of individuals, usually in the matter of holding property, either real or personal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Criminal law has to do with alleged offenses against society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">International law is either civil or criminal law of conduct between members of different nations or groups of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is apparent, then, that as long as there has been a human race, living under a form of society where differences of opinion occur, there has been a need for an expressed opinion of right and wrong. That expressed opinion is what we know as ‘law’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will be further apparent that the origin of ‘law’ dates back to the time of the first expressed opinion, or shall we say, ‘judicially’ expressed opinion of right or wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Various histories may be consulted on the point of when that first judicially expressed opinion was given. Our evolutionist friend wouldn’t venture a guess, especially if he is a lawyer, because he would have to admit that his progenitors were monkeys and some law ‘precedents’ are so old that they might reach back to that stage of human history, with the result that present law might be termed ‘monkey legislation’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, among almost all nations, a belief in their origin points back to a time when, for an offense, not always clearly defined, their first father was driven from a country which favored his existence to a land which necessitated hard labor to maintain his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most famous jurist who ever lived, who was also the writer of a better code of laws than exists today, substantiates this. He says, in substance, that the first man was banished to a foreign country for disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Law, to that eminent jurist, was not merely an agreement between two or more individuals to agree to a certain principle, as for instance, to ban the use of alcohol in certain forms, to prohibit stealing, etc. Rather, to him, lave, whether civil, criminal or international, was the opinion, expressed, unexpressed or implied, of the Great Judge, upon the principles which form the skeleton or framework of society in His universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And I submit that this statement will withstand the attacks and battering-rams of all so-called “jurists”, ancient or modern, eminent or otherwise, who, deluded in such a weighty matter as justice, administer in so-called “Christian” countries, today, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Roman law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just as true is the statement, that both ancient and modern jurists who have administered Roman law instead of Mosaic law are, to the extent that these two codes of law differ, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘off.’ </span><span class="font8">And I know of only one judge living today who does not come within the scope of that word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘off’,</span><span class="font8"> and he has ceased to practice it, believing it a much more honorable thing to teach it. There may be others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Someone has said that Mosaic law forms the basis of our code of laws today. That does not seem to agree with the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will remember the young boy who got his first jackknife. It was a double-bladed knife.-The first day he broke the little blade. His father had a new blade put in. The next day he broke the big blade. Again a new blade w<sup>y</sup>as put in. The next day he broke the handle and a new handle was put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, if you can figure out when he got a new knife you can likely figure out also when people got started on Roman (heathen) law. ..... \</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A fundamental difference between the Roman and the Mosaic codes, and this difference cannot be overestimated, is that the former presumes two parties to be involved in a dispute</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">while the Mosaic code postulates a third party, or, more properly, always includes Jehovah God as the First Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first four laws of the Mosaic code deal with the conduct of the human race with respect to the Creator. The Boman code recognizes no such relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Mosaic code recognizes a relationship and a need for law to govern the conduct of the human race as between:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(a) Man and Creator</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(b) Child and parent</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(c) Man and man, regarding the sanctity of life</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(d) Man and woman</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(e) Man and man, regarding property and, (f) Laws pertaining to hygiene.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman code is defective in that it fails to recognize any duty of conduct between man and his Creator as such, or between man and his Creator as a First Party in all legal actions. That, of course, is natural in a man-made code of laws. But, it also indicates that the Roman code is man-made; therefore the product of an imperfect mind; therefore, where it differs from the Mosaic code it is an incorrect expression of the principles of right and wrong. The facts show that it does so materially differ from the Mosaic code and that it encourages and condones some of the major evils in the present system. Its administrators, as a result, are to be criticized for that in their study and application of the law they exact its observance to the letter, all the while prohibiting their minds from delving too deeply into its hoary foundation and the inequity of its results. Justice deals with fundamentals, and yet judges are afraid to investigate them. This results in much injustice to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most ludicrous of these differences, to me, appears to be that in all sobriety a judge will require a witness or prisoner to take an oath on the Bible (which contains amongst other things the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mosaic code)</span><span class="font8"> and, by inference, require him to say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I swear that the evidence I shall give will be as true as the words of this Book, which I recognize to be the inspired words of God, the Great Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The learned judge then proceeds to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">forget</span><span class="font8"> all about that Great Judge and His code of laws, and judges the man on the Roman </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(heathen) </span><span class="font8">code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every such judge, to the extent that his judgment, based on the Roman code, differs from the Mosaic code and dissents from the Supreme Judge, makes a farce of the Scriptures. And here we note some of the essential differences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In respect to the lending of money the Mosaic law (Lev. 25: 36-38) reads,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; . . . Thou shalt not give him [thy brother, even though a stranger, or sojourner] thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. I am the Lord your God .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This law provides that money shall not be loaned upon usury, or interest, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">but</span><span class="font8"> “thou shalt [recognize thy duty to the First Party, thy Creator, and] fear thy God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman law is a positive contradiction of the Mosaic law on this point and condones interest, and excessive interest. And this abuse of money which, like cankers spreading, grows in size the more it is used, will accumulate until it has eaten up the wealth of the world and starved the people who created it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This child of injustice is the parent of other children of iniquity: the stock exchanges, the slums, the banking system, child labor, national debts, huge taxation, coupon clipping, agricultural bankruptcy, etc., all attributable to payinginterest for the use of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Protection for these husky children of iniquity is afforded by legislation, vaults, armies and navies, battleships, aeroplanes, gases, the militia, the judiciary, the police, the governments, etc., so that almost every guardian of righteousness in the world finds its time occupied in the defense of iniquity, as Tennyson said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘Uis honour, rooted in dishonour stood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And faith, unfaithful, kept him falsely true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Usury is likewise the vicious opponent of peace, of disarmament, of agricultural prosperity, of living wages, of life itself, and of brotherly love. Were this statute taken from the Mosaic code made an amendment to the Roman code, and enforced, it is inconceivable what a colossal transformation of the earth would result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With respect to the relationship between child and parent the two codes do not greatly differ, except that here again the Creator is not recognized as a First Party, much to the detriment of child and parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As between man and man, with respect to the sanctity of human life, the Roman code presumes greater mercy than the Mosaic code, in that capital punishment is not required for the same offenses. In effect, however, this results in greater crime. Murder is not always punished by taking the murderer’s life. Lighter punishment results in more crime. Justice is justice and Chicago is Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here, again, Jehovah is not recognized as a First Party. Nations today undertake, for selfish purposes, to violate the law of the sanctity of hu</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font8">an life. The Mosaic law would hold them responsible: tooth for tooth, eye for eye, life for life. The Roman law recognizes, or at least does not dispute, the right of war as a final arbiter in all dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Israel at times undertook to violate this law by making war on their neighbors, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">prompted by a selfish purpose.</span><span class="font8"> When this occurred, Jehovah administered His own law, brought retribution upon Israel, and they were required to pay, life for life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, there were occasions when Jehovah pronounced the sentence of punishment or extermination on neighboring peoples, and He re-<sup>1 </sup>quired Israel to act as His executioner. On these' occasions He gave them positive instructions, and prospered their warfare fought under His' instructions. In this He was merely chastising' wayward creatures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where human life is taken in order to acquire property or to defend seized property, no justification can be offered under the Mosaic law. This again shows the necessity for recognizing the great First Party in any equitable eternal code of law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As between man and woman, there is a growing looseness in amendments to our present code which presumes to bring about equal rights between them. Broadmindedness is desirable, but, with infinity on the east to infinity on the west as His scope, who can be more broadminded than the Creator, and His word is that ‘woman was made for man’ and that ‘man is the head of the woman’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adultery is punished more lightly under the Roman law, and grows faster as a result. A doctor testified in the Canadian house of commons that two percent (two people in every hundred) of the people of Montreal, Canada, are added each year to the list of those afflicted with venereal diseases and diseases resulting from violation of the laws regulating the conduct between man and woman. It is said that one-sixth of all marriages in the United States result in divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As between man and man, regarding property (and possibly more lawsuits, civil, criminal and international, arise in controversies involving property than any other) the Roman code differs so completely from the Mosaic code that there is little, if anything, in common between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fundamentally, the Roman code says, title to property (internationally) may always be decided by war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Civilly, title to real property vests in the crown or the state and may be granted by it to any individual by gift, or for a price. The individual registers a certificate of his title and may then sell or otherwise dispose of his property and receive the benefits which accrue from such sale; or, he may will it (at death) to his descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">j Fundamentally, the Mosaic code says, title to property is in the Creator. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">j Judges don’t take that seriously though. Yet '.they do take seriously the oath of the witness (who swears that his own veracity will be on a (par with that of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">| The only transfers of title to ownership of ireal property provided in the Scriptures are Jhose made by Jehovah to Abraham (Gen. (17: 8) and to the Jews (as descendants of Abraham) as a deed of gift. Stephen said Abraham’s right to that property has not been abrogated, <sub>;</sub>but still persists. Nations under Roman law, however, have usurped it, and it stands usurped today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- This, deed of gift to the Jews was qualified by stating that while the land could be bought and sold, the law of jubilee required it and certain other rights to be restored to the individual each fiftieth year. In the event of a sale the price was to be determined by the years of use which could be made of it before the fiftieth year arrived:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. (Lev. 25: 23, 24) Because the Jews violated this law, the Supreme Judge sentenced them to seventy years banishment in Babylon. Violation by Gentile nations under Roman law would seem to merit much severer punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today, if a bank holds a mortgage for $1,000 on a $2,000 property, in the event of inability to pay principal and interest by the mortgagor, he loses the entire property. Under the Mosaic law he could only lose its use for a term of years (unless it happened to be a house and lot ■within a walled city, and even then he would likely not lose it).—Lev. 25: 25-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the foregoing it might now be evident as to who is the author of the Roman code, which usurps the rights of individuals and a nation granted under the Mosaic code. You’re right1 It is the same one who misused the earth in the first place, and who now seeks to apportion the proceeds of his theft among his evil progeny, and withal ‘legalize’ it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">History records the same usurpation ‘legalized’ under Egyptian law which, as administered by Egyptian judges, condoned the oppression of the Israelites by the taskmasters. Appeals to higher courts were useless until ‘the cries of the people reached the Supreme Judge’. It is recorded that then lie delivered them with great slaughter to the Egyptians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And history repeats itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Between the plantiff and justice today is a great gulf fixed. He might as well, at the outset, make up his mind that a lawsuit will not bring him justice as measured by the Mosaic law; and even justice as contemplated in the Roman law is obtainable only in theory. To illustrate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">F. V., a farmer, shipped a earload of cattle by the C. railway, in winter. Opportunity was to be provided him, under his contract, to feed and water the cattle in transit at least once in twenty-four hours. The railway company was to get them to their destination as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Due to rough handling en route, cold weather, no water, and delay, the majority of the cattle died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A clear case for some $2,400 damages was made against the railway and granted by the trial judge, with costs. The company, however, knowing the man had little money, threatened to appeal the case if the man did not accept about $800 ($400 of which would be required to pay his lawyer). They also made.it clear that if they lost on appeal they would take it to the next court, for no other purpose than to so burden him with costs that all he obtained from them eventually would be eaten up with lawyers’ fees. Eventually F. V. was forced to settle for sufficient money to pay his own lawyer’s fees and his expenses, receiving no compensation for his $2,400 loss. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this way corporations teach the people not to expect justice. Truly, “We are all equal before the law, but we are not all equal in getting around it.” Likely it was of this practice that Jesus said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. (Luke 11: 46) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;°</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And this ease is typical of the practice of withholding justice from the poor, by threatening to pile up ‘the costs of justice’ to defeat the ends of justice. Courts of appeal are, therefore, used as a bane instead of a blessing, notwithstanding the integrity of many of the judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An amelioration of this system might be achieved by dispensing with the legal profession, as such, and placing lawyers in the service of the government, there to teach and dispense law and to argue before a judge the respective points of view of plaintiff and defendant. However, we place no great faith in ‘nationalization of lawyers’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was Anatole France, I believe, who once said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The majesty of the law is the same to rich and poor alike, in that it prevents them both from begging bread and sleeping under bridges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But it may not be deduced from the injustices of the law’s administration that all lawyers and judges are crooked. Many judges, desiring to administer righteousness, will render a judgment which overrides the technicalities of the law, only to find that it will be appealed and the appeal courts will say the technicality must be observed, and that, not because they wish to observe the letter and not the spirit, but because shackled with ‘precedents’, they are severely pulled into line by having their decisions reversed by higher courts, and no judge likes his decisions reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These precedents are awful things. Literally, they are adjudged cases or decisions of courts of justice considered as furnishing an example or authority for an identical or similar case afterwards arising or a similar question of law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Galileo explored the realms of science and found something that disagreed with existing ideas ‘precedents’ were rained down on him and he was told he was violating law, just because he investigated something that was never investigated before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When, in England, the question arose as to whether women could vote, it was decided on ‘precedent’. They haven’t voted before, and it must be taken that to do what has not been done in the past is unlawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And a ‘smart’ lawyer need only twist his case to fit precedents, or bring out the points in his case which fit a precedent, and neglect the points which don’t fit, and he wins his case. He quite frankly admits there is no responsibility on him to bring out the whole truth, but just enough to fit the precedent. Corporations pay big salaries for this, and, largely, that is what corporation counsel are for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Apostle Paul evidently didn’t think that was an honest way of making a living, so he took up tentmaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus too spoke of ‘precedents’ as ‘traditions rvhich make void the word of God’ (the Mosaic law in particular), which rendered the spirit of the law of none effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who fails to see the preparation of the ele-' ments the world over today seeking for deliverance from the iron heel of Roman law, and its author, the Devil, and all its inequities, must be blind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of armies. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton: ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And to those who ask, “Which law should I abide by, Roman law, or the Mosaic law as confirmed by Christ?” we say, Let your minds go back, back for a moment, over the countless hills of time, over the mountains of centuries, to the eternal wisdom of the apostle:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. . . , Behold, the judge standeth before the door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Iron versus Aluminum Utensils</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. S. R. Love, St. Petersburg, Fla., writes that he had one patient who for years came in at intervals for acute digestive troubles, but that when he returned from the North this past fall he was in splendid health, the best the doctor had ever seen in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In about a week the man came in sick. The doctor suggested he had been poisoned with aluminum. The man said it was strange, but that when the family went north for the summer they had borrowed a lot of iron cookingutensils, having left all the aluminum pots in Florida. As soon as they got back to them the old troubles reappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Personal Experience with Aluminum </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mary E. Elcstrand (Calif.)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8"> COULD not believe that aluminum could be so poisonous, when so many people are using aluminum cooking utensils, until I had experience with a glass jar of homemade canned beans. This jar had an aluminum lid. When I was ready to use the beans, I could not get the lid off the jar. So I set the jar in a back shed, and in time the lid was eaten full of holes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three years ago I bought a good many aluminum cooking utensils. I churned a little cream in one of these utensils. Both butter and buttermilk were so black that I threw it all out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When I got to reading </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> I read so much about aluminum poison that I<sup>: </sup>quit its use and got agateware, as it is much-----------</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">At the Crossroads </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Sillaway</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font8">URING the past ages of man’s existence conditions were decidedly unfavorable for scientific and mechanical advancement. Not until near the end of the eighteenth century of our so-called “Christian” era did Providence begin to favor the enlightenment, freedom and opportunity necessary for any marked degree of progress along scientific and mechanical lines. This progress, necessarily slow at its beginning, has gained momentum with time. It seems almost unbelievable that the accumulated mechanical achievements of our day are in the main the products of less than a century of scientific development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the advent of labor-saving machines and devices, the necessities of life produced by slow, crude methods met the demand; and when the machine appeared, in the inevitable displacement of crude hand labor, some thinkers of the day regarded it with alarm. Apparently it must eventually lead to a radical state of unemployment that would spell catastrophe to the social fabric. But as time went on and the demand for labor increased, with the increased installment of labor-saving machines confidence was restored and the calamity predictors promptly forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the process of machine development every avenue of commerce was stimulated. By it the demand for raw material of practically all kinds was many times multiplied over all former demands; and the great mining and steel industries were given birth. Great transportation projects were launched to facilitate the moving and distribution of raw material and the products of factory and farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The building and operating of factories led to the segregation of an ever increasing element of the population into city and town and to the creating of great industrial and mercantile centers. A market for farm products was created, and the farmer prospered with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the result of all this, a general era of prosperity was ushered in such as was never before known. That this was to continue indefinitely was the apparent mental attitude of the majority; for few ever stop to consider the relationship of existing social conditions to their foundation cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An analysis of the situation, however, reveals the startling fact that the fears of those who in the beginning visioned breakers ahead were not so far-fetched as they have been generally considered, as it is now plainly evident that the fruitage of mechanical science has indeed headed the present social order straight toward the rocks of an inevitable destruction. That this has not occurred before is due to well defined reasons based on the foundation of mechanical development and progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The deceiving part of the entire program has been that, instead of a decreased demand for labor with the installment of labor-saving machines and devices, we find that for a prolonged period of time the result was the very opposite in the stimulation of the labor market with a continually increasing demand as the resources of the nations were gradually developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The development of these resources went hand in hand with the development of the machine, and were essential to it, and a part of it; and as long as the machine was in process of development, a healthy demand for labor was the natural result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another item that has tended to prolong the era of labor prosperity is that with the buying power increased through more prosperous conditions than formerly, and with the cheapening and multiplying of manufactured products through labor-saving machinery, the wants, necessities and luxuries of the average individual and his family far exceed those of the days of crude hand-manufacturing. But this alone is badly inadequate to furnish more than a small percent of available labor with employment under a condition of completed machine development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But while the machines will continue to be improved for many decades to come, if not indefinitely, the development of the machine in the sense of which we here speak is necessarily in a limited space of time. With a completion of its development the general demand for labor must cease and a destructive era of unemployment result, with disastrous effect upon the present social fabric, which is entirely unsuited to the developed machine. That, at least, would be the natural result without the exercise of providential influences in restraint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In tracing the development of the machine we find its completion in a practical sense already past history centering around the beginning of the present century. At that time we find the machine had come into general use in the leading nations c<sup>¥</sup> earth. Enough factories had been built to reasonably meet the manufacturing demands of the day in these nations; and fairly adequate transportation facilities had been completed. The machine age was fully ushered in; and without some abnormal influence to prevent it, a radical state of unemployment and a more or less general stagnation of business must soon have set in, with spasms of increasing severity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For a time it appeared that this catastrophe was immediately inevitable, and symptoms of it did actually develop. But the time in the divine arrangement for this was not yet ripe, and a miracle was interposed. This miracle was nothing more or less than the mushroom development of the automobile. It can be clearly seen that the automobile has not been a part of the development of the machine in the sense in which we are considering it. Rather its development has been merely a part of the mechanical evolution of the developed machine in its further improved application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The development of the automobile has meant also the development of the resources of raw material that enters into its manufacture and upkeep, and the development of its resources of operation, such as the gasoline industry, filling stations, garages, and the building of suitable highways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This has been done; and now that the world is fairly well supplied with motor vehicles, it can be truthfully said that the development of the automobile is complete. Again a crisis is upon the present social order; and this time it will be met, for iniquity has reached its full and the time is ripe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under our social organization the great blessings resulting from the scientific and mechanical advancement of our day have been counterbalanced by sore evils that are throttling the masses with their encircling clammy tentacles of power. These evils are emanating from a gigantic and powerful plutocracy which is a direct hybrid fathered by the iniquitous social order under which it came into existence, and born of the machine in its period of development by a forced conception through seizure of the financial advantages made possible by it. The corruption that has ensued as the result of the centralization of such an enormous volume of wealth into the hands of the few has never been surpassed in earth's history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The demand for labor henceforth cannot be otherwise than on a decline. Labor-saving machinery is constantly being improved, with the ends in view of greater capacity, more perfect and simple automatic operation, and a reduction in needed operators. One man now does the work with a machine that all the way from half a dozen to a thousand or more, according to the kind of machine and work, formerly did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our social order is surely at the end of its road. It has reached the parting of the way. It is irretrievably hopeless, a weed gone to seed. It is rotting off at its root, its financial foundation; and its leaves are falling. But with its passing we have the Scriptural assurance of a new social order in which the machine will be a source of real blessing instead of a curse of power in the hands of plutocratic overlords, as it is now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Fading Glory of Columbus </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Francis V. Greene</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE clipping on Columbus that you so kindly sent me is returned herewith; many thanks for your courtesy. I have typed a copy for my files. I am interested in this matter, and have a lot of information on it now; what I copied from the clipping will be a welcome addition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has struck me as queer why all the bunk about Columbus is taught in the schools. It seems that if anything at all is taught, it should be facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is certain that Columbus was not a navigator. The trip in 1492 was navigated by Martin Alonzo Pinzon, captain of the Pinta. The Spanish queen did not finance the trip; this was done by certain wealthy Spanish Jews. When Columbus came home from the first voyage, he stood away to the north. When he reached the latitude of Bermuda, he stood off to the east. Taking advantage of a wind that show’ed knowledge of these waters, Pinzon had gotten particulars of the islands in the West Indies from the Vatican. They had a chart by the Florentine mapmaker Toscanelli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">October 10 the pilot of the Santa Maria, Pedro Nino, spoke to the admiral and said, “It would be well to slow down tonight because, according to your book, we are but sixteen leagues from land, or twenty at most.” There was a bright moon that night, and at 2 a. m. the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">lookout, Juan Rodrigo Bermejo, of Molinos, who belonged to the crew of Pinzon’s vessel, sighted land. This proved to be the island of San Salvador. And so it goes. Most publications will print nothing of this sort; so the facts are not generally known. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Attractions of North Dakota </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Writ. Rafferty</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font8">ANY tourists view North Dakota as a monotonous stretch of grain fields and prairie uplands. But if they will consent to take a little </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">pasear</span><span class="font8"> off the beaten highways they will find a number of places well worth seeing. No middle-western state can boast of richer, more beautiful regions than those of the Missouri, Red, Mouse, James, Sheyenne, and Maple river valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ransom county, on the banks of the Sheyenne, we have the historical site of old Fort Ransom. Its surrounding valley is an exact replica in miniature of the lovely picture on the back of the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the north central part we point to the Sulley’s Hill region about Devil’s Lake, also of historical fame. There are islands here which have been preserved in the original state in which they were when the white man first set foot upon them, and which are a joy to behold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Still farther north, and extending across the boundary line into Canada, we find the Turtle mountains, with their lakes, woods, and quaint, turtle-backed clusters of steep hills. Noted ornithologists declare that a greater variety of birds congregate here each summer than in any other place in the world. Nature-loving tourists, please take note and include in your itinerary for the coming summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Taking a big jump from here we step into the Killdeer mountain region, with its famous petrified forest and natural caves and grottoes which are not duplicated elsewhere on the globe. A petrified tree is one that has died, yet not having become dried or seasoned, still continues to take up water and mineral from the ground. The water then evaporates and leaves the mineral matter to fill up the pores and cavities in the wood. The trees then in the course of time become stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles from here we come to a weirdly fantastic upheaval known as the Bad Lands, on the northern edge of which Teddy, the twenty-fourth president of the U.S., owned and operated several ranches, one of which is the famous Elkhorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This region must be seen with the individual eye to be appreciated, as no camera, permanent or movie, can reproduce a satisfactory picture of it. When one first catches a glimpse of the Bad Lands, he holds his breath in wonder. A veritable chaos of peaks, ridges, hills and plateaus stretch before one as far as he can see. Steep buttes and red-topped hills are crowded together as closely as they can stand; with deep ravines and gulches extending in every direction between them. The fact that the average altitude is but two thousand to three thousand feet makes the thing seem more incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Geologists tell us that this great jumble of fantastic peaks, bluffs, and confused mass of rocks was once a great lignite bed which has been burned, and in some places is still burning. After the fire the storms and winds of the ages helped nature soften the whole region, leaving it endowed with the hundreds of different colors we see today. Owing to these facts the region is intensely interesting to the botanist, the artist, and the traveler who believes in seeing America first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foremost agent in forming the Bad Lands is the same as that found elsewhere since the earth appeared above the seas, namely, the great flood of Biblical reference. Also, the erosion and cutting of the deep gorges and valleys was helped by the flow of the Little Missouri and its tributary streams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the most striking things of this region is the systematic arrangement of the rocks, sandstone layers, and clays, which have gorgeous tints, blue, pink, red, yellow, and brown. The harder layers of rock and sandstone form shelves, tables and pinnacles, such as Lone butte, Saddle butte, Sheep butte, Horse-nose butte, Chaloner Lookout, and the Three Sisters ; while the clays form cliffs that resemble nothing so much as the colorful scallops on the fancy cookies we adored in childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A burning lignite mine is located about fifteen oi’ twenty miles from Alexander. Hero tourists have no need of campfires, as the intense heat escaping from the many open fissures serves the purpose for cooking and warmth. Here also the ranch stock gather to escape the bitter blasts when allowed to graze in the open during the winter months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The heat from the burning lignite bakes and hardens the overlaying clay and forms a pink or red clinker called “scoria”. This scoria often caps the ridges, buttes, and bluffs, giving them the appearance of having been drenched in blood, thus forming another striking feature of the Bad Lands’ scenery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An association was organized in 1924 for the purpose of forming a national park of this and the Killdeer mountain region. This is to be called the Roosevelt National park, and will include the Elkhorn ranch and many other places <sup>1 </sup>connected with Roosevelt’s life in Dakota.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Justice in Iowa</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE man in the street often says that there is no justice in the courts; and it seems that this statement is justified, at least in Iowa, whence comes certainly the most shameful judicial rulings that it has been the misfortune of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> to be aware of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The case in point is where two engineers were criticized by a brother member of the profession for putting in some very bad pavement. A Mr. X who did the criticizing certainly “bawled them out”, in the language of the street. He admitted the publication of the article and claimed it was the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whether it was or was not the truth is totally immaterial, to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> The rulings of the court, however, are absolutely material, not only to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> but to everyone in the whole U.S.A., because the courts have a way of revering precedents, particularly those where curtailing free speech is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the case came into court Mr. X was denied the right to present pictures of the pavement, although the constitution of Iowa is strong on the fact that truth is admissible in evidence. Incidentally it might be noted that the presiding judge admitted to Mr. X privately that the pavement was rotten; that he had ridden over it himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. X was denied the right to mitigate the damages, although the laws of Iowa could not have favored the defendant in a libel suit more</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">if they had been written up by a professional scandalmonger. Mr. X was also denied the right </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">even to criticize a public officer.</span><span class="font8"> The presiding judge (who made the admission about the pavement) also allowed the plaintiffs to withdraw some damaging admissions that they stumbled into in cross-examination. He also instructed the jury to bring in a verdict against the defendant, when the Iowa law particularly says that the jury is judge of both law and fact in slander and libel. (Iowa is a code state in other respects.) There were two suits identical in every respect except that different names were shown as plaintiff. One jury brought in a verdict for damages of “No dollars and no cents”; the other brought in a verdict for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This, however, is immaterial. The crucial part of the situation is that a sovereign American citizen was not allowed a chance to defend himself in an American court. Also, that judges make decisions in absolute violation of the statute, clinging rather to some age-old precedent in some other court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have always been told how very rotten the big cities are, and (living in the biggest one on the American continent) we know it is so. However, we are glad that we live on the coast, where we can catch a steamer almost any day for man-handled Spain or dictatorship-ridden Italy. Iowa justice may come this way, and it may be advisable to run for the pier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some Recent Developments in Radio Broadcasting Technique </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Bdlph II. Leffler</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE technique of radio broadcasting, in common with other branches of industry, has undergone material developments toward improved efficiency during the last decade or less. Particularly during the past two years have noteworthy contributions been made which spell for the betterment of radio transmission and reception. I shall briefly describe in this article three major developments in the art of radio broadcasting which are being used by the leading broadcasting stations of America, and which produce a decided improvement in the quality of radio reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">, The three developments referred to are crystal control, high percentage modulation, and sec-tionalized antenna-supporting steel towers. These are all associated with the machinery at the transmitting station, and not at the receiving sets in the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Considering now the first of the three, let us see just what is meant by crystal control and why it is of importance at a radio station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every modern radio station has an electrical device known as an oscillator. The function of this device is to generate an oscillating current having a frequency in cycles per second equal to frequency of the carrier wave of the station. Stated differently, the frequency of this oscillator determines the frequency (or the wave length) of the carrier wave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This oscillator usually consists of a vacuum tube such as is used in a receiving set, only is larger and capable of handling more power. This tube is connected in an electrical circuit in such a way that when a direct current is applied to the plate of the tube, it will so function as to change this direct current into an oscillating current having a certain frequency depending upon the value of the electrical constants of the circuits associated with it. For a broadcasting station this frequency must be very high, in fact, often runs into millions of cycles per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A mechanical analogy perhaps will assist to make it clear as to just how a direct current can be changed into an oscillating current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Consider a violin and a bo^v. A violinist presses the bow lightly upon a string, and as the bow is drawn across the string vibratory (or oscillatory) motion is set up in the string. This vibratory action persists as long as the motion of the bow continues. Here we have an example of how constant motion in one direction in a body can produce oscillatory motion in another body. Not only can oscillations be so produced, but the frequency of oscillations can be controlled at will by adjusting the constants of the mechanical system, that is, the pressure, length, weight, and tension of the string.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this mechanical system the violin string is analogous to the vacuum tube and its associated electrical circuits. The power of the player’s arm exerted upon the bow is analogous to the direct current povzer applied to the tube. The combination of these elements results in oscillatory action, the only difference being that in the one case the action is mechanical and in the other electrical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In radio broadcasting it is very essential that the frequency of the carrier wave remain as near- constant as possible. This is necessary for two important reasons. First, to prevent one broadcasting channel in the frequency spectrum from overlapping that of an adjacent channel. And, second, to prevent one type of distortion in the quality of transmission resulting from a wobbling carrier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the unimproved types of stations not using crystal control it is practically impossible to maintain a constant carrier wave frequency. This is due to the fact that some of the electrical constants associated with the oscillator vary in a manner more or less proportional to the percentage of modulation. It is seen, therefore, that any device that will maintain a constancy of frequency during all operative conditions is highly desirable. Such a device is found in crystal control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For a number of years it has been known, that certain forms of crystals, particularly that of quartz, possess piezo electrical properties. That is, if a mechanical pressure be applied to the crystal in the proper direction in relation to the electric and optic axes of the crystal, an electrical potential will be generated in the crystal due solely to the mechanical pressure. And, vice versa, should an electrical potential be applied across the crystal in the proper direction, a .mechanical pressure will be generated, or, in other words, the crystal will actually change its physical dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, when a plate of such a crystal is properly connected in the electric circuit of a vacuum tube the tube wdll oscillate at a frequency depending primarily upon the actual physical thickness of the plate. A plate having a thickness in the order of one-sixteenth of an inch and an area of approximately one square inch will • ■ ibrate mechanically at the rate of approximately one million vibrations per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When such a crystal is connected to a vacuum tube, the tube will oscillate and thus generate a current having a frequency of exactly that determined by the physical thickness of the crystal plate. This frequency will remain constant to within a few cycles per second over a long period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All modern broadcasting stations employ a quartz crystal built into a specially constructed compartment the temperature of which is thermostatically controlled and. held at a constant value. This oscillator is then associated with amplifiers and the power level raised to the proper operating value. The frequency of the carrier wave output from such a station is absolutely constant, thus greatly improving the quality of the reception in the receiving sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Modulation, as the term is applied at a broadcasting station, signifies the process of impressing upon the carrier wave the audio frequencies represented in the speech and music. The process is analogous to that of varying the amplitude of vibration of a tuning fork (without varying the frequency of vibration).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Consider for a moment a tuning fork vibrating at a constant rate, and imagine the path of motion of the fork to be transferred onto a moving strip of paper. It is evident that there will be traced upon the strip of paper an up-and-down series of lines representing a wave motion, and that the amplitude of the peaks of this wave motion will be constant. Let this constant amplitude wave motion represent the unmodulated carrier wave from a broadcasting station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, let us set the tuning fork in vibration at a constant rate again, and, simultaneously at a slow rate, by some mechanical means gradually increase and then decrease the amplitude of its vibration from its normal value a number of times. The trace upon the strip of paper will demonstrate the resulting effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will be observed that the amplitude of the tuning fork vibrations is not constant, but that if the peak of each successive vibration be joined by a continuous line there will be formed a second wave motion superimposed upon the first. That is, there will be formed a wave motion of low frequency superimposed upon another wave motion of high frequency. Stated differently, the high-frequency vibrating rate of the tuning fork has been modulated by another frequency of low rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Exactly the same process is accomplished at a broadcasting station when the high-frequency carrier wave is modulated by the much lower frequencies of the audio spectrum. We thus have the speech and music frequencies superimposed upon the carrier wave, all of which is radiated out into space for the receiving set to detect. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the unimproved stations not employing high percentage modulation, the amount the carrier wave is modulated is usually of the order of 20 to 30 percent. That is, having a carrier radiating .100 percent power, only 20 to 30 percent of this power is modulated and radiating useful energy. The remaining percentage of the power is thus wasted, serving no useful purpose, but, instead, causing a great amount of interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the improved stations employing high percentage modulation, the carrier is capable of......</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">being modulated the full 100 percent. This represents a great increase in the amount of useful energy being radiated, besides eliminating much interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Stated differently, a station, after adopting the new system of modulation, will, with the .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">same amount of power, produce a coverage of more than twice the area of that produced by one using the old system. All the better class of broadcasting stations are at present using high percentage modulation. The remaining ones are adopting the improved system as rapidly as economic conditions will permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The latest development in broadcasting m;i-chinery aiming at increased efficiency of radiation and an improved service area is the use of sectionalized antenna-supporting towers. Such, towers are steel structures built up into a number of sections, each section being insulated from the others by a deck of huge porcelain insulators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Various attempts have been made heretofore to eliminate some of the disadvantages inherent to steel structures in the immediate vicinity of a radio station. Some owners have resorted to wooden masts guyed by steel cables; others have built insulators at the base of steel towers. Both methods offer improvements, but dividing a tower into a number of sections appears to be the best method offered to date. The new radio station of WHK, Cleveland, Ohio, in operation</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The qOLDEN AQE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">since January this year, is the first to use this type of tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every broadcasting station endeavors to serve as large a radio audience as possible consistent with the amount of power available. Assuming a uniform distribution of population, in order to cover the largest area possible it is required that the field pattern of radiation of the station be a true circle with the station itself located at the center of the circle. That is, the field strength measured in a horizontal plane in all directions will be constant at equal distances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the majority of stations the field pattern is not a circle, but in some cases is so much distorted as to resemble a figure eight or a four-leaf clover. Quite evidently there will be localities around such stations where the signals will not be as loud as possible, due entirely to the distorted field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cause for this distortion is due largely to masses of steel or iron structures in the immediate vicinity of the station (it is assumed that the antenna has been properly designed so as not to be a contributing factor). Particularly is this true where steel towers are near the antenna and have a fundamental frequency approximately the same as the carrier wave from the antenna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only do such steel structures produce a distorted field pattern, but large currents are induced therein which cause considerable absorption of the radiated power. Obviously, if such steel structures are broken up electrically into small sections, the distortion from that source will be eliminated, and, likewise, the amount of absorption will be considerably reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Combining all such improvements in broadcasting, we can now understand why some stations can be heard with such superiority of quality and consistency of reception above others not using the latest developments. .</span></p>

The prophecy reads: “Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is known that the devil-worshipers of ancient times did sacrifice human beings when laying the foundations of new structures, and the account of the building of Jericho recorded in 1 Kings 16:34 shows that the sacrifices which Joshua prophesied were actually made.

<p><span class="font8">A Few Words About Iron</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">RON is the most useful of all metals. Five percent by weight of the earth’s crust is made up of it; so there will always be plenty. It was once considered so valuable that the iron supply of the nation was hid in the royal treasury. By ancient methods two men could produce about a dozen pounds of iron a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blast furnace was invented in Germany in the fifteenth century, and the rolling of sheet iron began in England in 1728. The first sheet rolling mill in the United States was built at Pittsburgh in 1818. The successful outcome of the American Revolution was in large part due to the progress made on this side of the ocean in iron manufacture. By 1880 America had taken the lead in the world’s production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ore is now mined in twenty-eight American states. It is seldom considered worth mining if it contains less than 35 percent of iron. A rich ore will contain 50 percent. In the Lake Superior region is an area where high-grade ores are mined with steam shovels, giving America unparalleled advantages in iron manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a blast furnace coke is burned under forced draft of superheated air, at a temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This frees the molten iron from the oxygen of the ore and the iron trickles down to the bottom of the furnace, where it is drawn off every four hours. The capacity of a blast furnace may be well up toward a thousand tons a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In modern practice the iron never gets chilled until it is turned into something useful. From the blast furnace the liquid iron goes to the steel mill, where it is treated by the Bessemer process, if intended for steel rails or structural purposes, or by the open-hearth process if intended for plates or other uses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bessemer process of burning out impurities in great converters, fifteen tons at a time, is cheaper than the open-hearth process; but the latter method produces a better quality of iron and steel and embraces triple the tonnage produced by the Bessemer process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the open-hearth furnace the iron is cleansed of its impurities by resting in a vast basin over which intense heat is caused to play. Charges of limestone absorb some of the phosphorus, sulphur and other impurities. It takes about twelve hours to make a 75-ton heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After refining by the Bessemer or open-hearth process the iron is poured into great ingots, some of which weigh as much as four tons. The ingots are fed one at a time through a blooming mill where they are rolled into blooms or slabs, or billets. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blooms are worked up into rails and structural shapes; the slabs into plates; and the billets into all the thousand and one other things that are made of iron, such as tubes, rods, wire, rivets, bolts, chain, nails and fencing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brightest minds in the world are constantly at work to eliminate the sulphur, phosphorus and silicon impurities which are found in iron, and to provide just the right amount of carbon and manganese to give the metal proper strength, hardness, ductility, etc., for the purpose for which it is intended. Complete elimination of these impurities would make the iron unfit for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Iron men claim that 25 percent of the annual tonnage of iron and steel is destroyed each year by rust and corrosion. Rust is really an iron ash where the iron surface has been burned by coming in contact with the oxygen in water. Rust prevention is accomplished by galvanization of the surface, and by mixtures of other metals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Sheet Iron Primer,</span><span class="font8"> from which these facts are taken, says: “Alloys of copper, chromium, tungsten, nickel, vanadium and molybdenum with iron and steel fill so important a place today in the industrial world that there is a growing tendency to call this &quot;The Age of Alloys’, rather than ‘The Age of Steel’. ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">An interesting case of barter is to be seen at the British Museum in the counterpart of a deed of conveyance of land at Port Phillip (now Melbourne), Australia, between the native chiefs and John Bateman, founder of Victoria colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The land was given in exchange for 20 pairs of blankets, 30 tomahawks, 100 knives, 50 pairs of scissors, 30 looking-glasses, 200 handkerchiefs, 100 pounds of flour, with a yearly rent of certain opiantities of these articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Want was the determining factor in barter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Obviously barter could exist only in very primitive societies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Primitive Societies</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the time of Cain, man has been possessed of the “Wanderlust”. Cain began the great trek to the “Land of Nod”; and through the centuries instability has marked all man’s efforts, physical and mental.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man, possessed of this roaming spirit, has started some great migrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it not feasible that when these migrations took place the weakest would drop out: form communities which would rapidly become primitive, degenerate through lack of sufficient and proper food and through insularity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whether they knew of the existence of money or not is immaterial. Falling out from the main body in the migration, money would have been of little use. Food had to be found and mutual bartering would arise, to satisfy want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Primitive peoples are degenerate peoples. They bear evidences of a community that once enjoyed the best society, but change of habitat and failure to survive with the fittest in the struggle for new objectives, left them to eke out an existence in places which they would never have chosen except by force of circumstance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cain was not far removed from perfect intelligence, and Josephus says that Cain was the author of weights and measures, and that he taught men cunning craftiness (or the princi-pies of finance).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If this is so, metal was obviously in use as money, whether the currency was by weight or coin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the book of Genesis, chapter 4, verses 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to 23, are wonderful in revealing the origin of polygamy, musical instruments, the varied uses of brass and iron, and the origin of poetic verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jabal, Jubal and Tubal Cain were descend- ........</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ants of Cain, and it seems clear they had an expert knowledge of the use of minerals. That money was a medium of exchange at that time seems highly probable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The statement of Paul that “the love of money is the root of all evil” may have a far-reaching significance that has not yet been fully appre-ciatcd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Probably Noah brought a knowledge of finance into the present evil world, for we read of Abraham as being rich in gold and silver when coming out of Egypt. This implies that Egypt was on a gold and silver currency at an early date, Ham evidently having made good use of the knowledge he had gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The elements that were the basis of the first world power, Egypt, are found in the three individuals who were instruments of Satan- before~— the Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cain was versed in finance, while Enos started religious hypocrisy and Chanock (son of Cain) began the political power.—Gen. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Enoch, however, walked with God, and testified as a witness for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An address by Judge Rutherford broadcast July 18 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH in His Word declares that when the time comes to place Christ His anointed King in control of the affairs of the universe, then this truth shall be told to the people. The truth shall enable the people to free themselves from oppression. By His prophet Isaiah (28:17, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font8"> F.) He says: “And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the ■waters shall overflow the hiding-place.” The time has now come for the telling of the truth to the people to begin. The truth cannot be told without exposing hypocrisy and the lies that have blinded the people to the truth and kept them in ignorance. Hypocrisy has furnished the hiding place or refuge for lies, and now that hiding place God -will sweep away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah hates hypocrisy because hypocrites are workers of iniquity. “Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. Thou shalt destroy them that speak [liesJ: the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.” (Ps. 5: 5, 6) A hypocrite is a vile person, and a combination of hypocrites working together increases the burdens of the deceived one. “For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.”—Isa. 32: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The greatest instrument for the practice and work of hypocrisy is that which is called “religion”. Hypocrisy came into vogue by and through the Devil’s religion. It was in the days of Enos that Satan began to mock and reproach God by inducing men to form an organization and “to call themselves by the name of the Lord”. (Gen. 4:26, margin) The beginning of Satan’s earthly organization was called “Bab-il”, or “Babylon”, which means “the gate to god”, that is, Satan, the god of this world. Babylon was built by Nimrod, whose name means “rebellion”, and its original name, “Bab-il,” is proof that it was built in defiance of Jehovah and to deride and mock Him and bring reproach upon His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religion took the most prominent part in that organization, and that was the Devil’s religion, or worship of Satan. Baal worship, the Devil religion, became the established religion of all the nations aside from Israel, and in time Israel fell under the spell of that satanic religion. (1 Ki. 16: 31-33; 18:19-40) The king of Babylon is shown by the Scriptures to be a specific representative of Satan, because God gave him one of the names that applies to Satan, to wit, Dragon. (Jer. 51:34) Hypocrisy has always flourished under the name of religion. Religion has been Satan’s chief means of deceiving the people. (See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font8"> p. 126.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jews’ Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When God organized Israel as His own people and made a covenant with that people, His first commandment was to shield and protect them from, the hypocritical Devil religion. He said: “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.” —Ex. 20:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The greatest crime committed by Israel was that of embracing and practicing the Devil religion, which the Lord denounces as “whoredom”. (Num. 25:1-5; Ezek. 16:1-36) In His covenant with Israel God made provision for the office of priest and prophet and for men to fill these offices. To represent God when in office a man must be entirely honest and true. Instead of pursuing an honest course of action, men installed in such offices became hypocrites. A hypocrite is one v/ho plays a part with a dishonest motive. He feigns to be good when he is in fact bad. He is a pretender to piety, virtue and honesty. He is a deceiver, a cheat and a fraud, and a dissembler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God planted the Israelites a pure “vine”; but that people, through the practice of the Devil religion and by the hypocrisy of her priests, turned into a degenerate vine. (Jer. 2:21-26) The clergy class of the Jews, made up of the priests, prophets, scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees, were the chief offenders against God, They claimed to be servants of Jehovah God, but their service of Him was in form only. Jesus told them that they were of their father the Devil and were doing the Devil’s will, and not Jehovah’s will and service. (John 8:44) He also said to them: “Ye hypocrites! well did</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qolden aqe</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men” (Matt. 15:7-9) Jesus denounced them as, a “wicked and adulterous generation”.—Matt. 16:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let it always be remembered that Israel in a covenant with Jehovah was God’s covenant poeple and that natural Israel foreshadowed spiritual Israel, which is otherwise called “Christianity”. The things of the law covenant foreshadowed greater things of the future, and that which came to pass upon natural Israel was typical and for examples of what should come to pass upon spiritual Israel at the end of the world. (Heb. 10:1; 1 Cor. 10:11) There were some honest and true Israelites who were without guile and without hypocrisy; but they were few. (John 1:47) The ruling and so-called “noble” class were hypocrites. In considering the history of the Jews pertaining to their religion we are reading in advance what has come to pass upon so-called “organized Christianity” at the' end of the world, where we now are. Among the professed followers of Christ there are some who are true and honest and without guile. But the crop of hypocrites is very large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God organized the church, or true Christianity, with Christ Jesus as the Head thereof, and this we call “spiritual Israel”. (Col. 1:18) God sets the members in the body of Christ as it pleases Him, and in the beginning He set some for prophets and some for teachers. (1 Cor. 12:18-28) As men created the places having the name of Pharisees and Sadducees among the Jews, and these composed the Jewish clergy, even so in the church men taking the name of Christ have created the offices and names of “pope”, “cardinal,” “doctor of divinity,” “right reverend,” and like titles, which are applied to the preachers, and these together form the clergy of so-called “Christianity”. These men, called the clergy, have made pretenses of being superior to other men. They have associated with and brought into close relationship with them men from whom they have received gifts and honors and special favors and upon whom they, the clergy, bestow, their favors, and these are called “the principal of the flock”.—Jer. 25: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is the clergy and the principal ones of their flocks that have organized and carried on what is today known as “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”. The name “Christendom” applies to all nations that call themselves “Christian” and that claim to practice “Christianity” as their religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The name “Christian” properly applies to those only who are in Christ by a covenant of sacrifice and baptism into His death, and taken into the covenant for the kingdom and anointed by the holy spirit. Such are wholly for the kingdom of God and His Christ. The name “Christian” or “Christianity” or “Christendom” is wrongfully applied to all people who claim to be followers of Christ but who in fact are not. Feigning to be followers of Christ and taking a contrary course is the practice of hypocrisy.. Claiming to be a Christian and at the same time supporting the Devil’s organization is the greatest hypocrisy; and therefore great “whoredom”, ■within the meaning of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why do the clergy appear before the camera and in the public places in long flowing robes richly embroidered or wearing other unusual garments? Has God directed them to do so? Is such done for the purpose of impressing the people with their own importance and their piety? Why do they go through certain formal ceremonies with much pomp and outward show<sup>7</sup>? Is that done to glorify God and to represent Him, or to be seen of men and to impress men with their own importance? If for the latter reason, then such is the practice of hypocrisy. Why do the clergy make long prayers, standing in public places, or by radio, and utter many vain words? Surely not for the purpose of glorifying God, but to'impress the people with their own importance and piety. The clergy of the Jews acted in a similar way; and what Jesus said of and concerning them applies likewise to the clergy of the present time who claim to be practicing the Christian religion. Jesus said: “But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.” —Matt. 23:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy of the present time take the most prominent seats in places of public assemblies and at banquets and at inaugural ceremonies of high officials of governments, and great prominence in “blessing” the armies. In this, are they obeying God’s commandments? Or is this formalism for the purpose of impressing the public with the importance of. themselves and the ruling factors? Every person must see that such ceremonies do not honor God; and there is not one scripture in the Bible that authorizes any follower of Christ to take such a course. By thus proceeding under the name of Christ, and claiming to represent God, they are practicing hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That hypocrisy is the greatest crime commit-. ted against God and deserves the greatest punishment, and that the clergy of &quot;Christendom” and the &quot;principal ones of their flock’ are the greatest of all hypocrites, is clearly proven by the testimony and denunciation of Jesus, which is here submitted. The clergy of the Jews had some light. They had reason to believe that Christ Jesus was exactly<sup>7</sup> what He claimed to be, the Son of God. They were in a covenant with Jehovah and it was their duty to know God’s Word. The clergy of so-called “organized Christianity” have had far greater opportunity to have more light than the Jewish clergy ever had. They have the words of Jesus and of the apostles and of the prophets, and the coming to pass of events in fulfilment of prophecy<sup>7</sup>, all of which have been brought to their attention; and these they have rejected. While claiming to be followers of Christ and representatives of God they still go on serving Satan, and thereby prove by their conduct that they are the sons of Satan, even as Jesus told the Pharisees they were. (John 8:42, 44) Therefore the words that Jesus uttered apply with even greater force to the clergy of the present time who claim to be preachers of the church of Christ and who at the same time practice the Devil religion and support the Devil’s schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today there is a comparatively small company of men and women in the land who are earnest and honest and who are diligently telling the people about God’s kingdom. They are taking no part in the politics of the governments, because they are wholly for the kingdom of God. Who are the men that most violently oppose that little company of faithful servants of the Lord who go about telling their fellow man of God’s provision for their blessing? It is the clergy class; and they induce the law-making and law-enforcement body of men to likewise interfere. The clergy attempt to prevent the use of the radio for the broadcasting of the message of God’s kingdom. They tell the people to stay away from the meetings addressed by teachers of the Bible, and they gather up and burn the books that are published and put in the hands of the people and that teach the message of God’s kingdom. They refuse to enter into the kingdom themselves, because they support the offspring of Satan, the League of Nations compact, and do their hardest work to keep others out of the kingdom of God. Therefore the testimony of Jesus is specifically applied to them at the present time. Jesus said: “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.”—Matt. 23:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same class of clergymen of “organized Christianity” support schemes which devour the substance of the widow and the orphans and others; and at the same time they stand in the public places and make long prayers for the purpose and intention of deceiving the people by adding a “sanctity” to the wicked schemes that are practiced by their allies. Therefore Jesus said to them: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.”-—Matt. 23:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These clergymen of “organized Christianity’ hold revivals and other meetings to which the people are invited, and get up great excitement and blaspheme God’s name by teaching the frightful doctrine of eternal torment, and like false doctrines, to wrongfully induce men to join their flocks and support their institutions. This they do without regard to the practice of men and women in their daily lives, whether it be good or bad. Concerning this practice by them the Lord said: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.”—Matt. 23:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These same “gentlemen of the cloth”, claiming to be preachers of God’s Word, are great sticklers for observing the letter of the law. If a poor man traveling on the highway is supposed to have in his possession any amount of intoxicating liquor these clergymen hold that the officer of the law is fully justified in killing that poor man if he 'does not halt at the very instant he is commanded to stop. This is called “shotgun enforcement of the law”, and the clergy publicly endorse it. At the same time, if a man of great wealth is found with some liquor little or nothing is said about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These same clergymen insist that men and women who go from house to house with the message of God in book form are violating the “peddler’s law” or the law concerning Sunday and. should be prosecuted for that reason, and they cause many of the humble followers of Christ to be arrested and prosecuted upon such charges. At the same time these clergymen neglect entirely the acts of mercy and the teaching of the people the Word of God, that they may have faith; -which work they ought to have done. Therefore the Lord says of them: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.”—Matt. 23: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These same clergymen hold themselves out before the people as men of the highest morality and piety. They loudly demand the rigid enforcement of the Prohibition law against the poor workingman, and yet many of them have their cellars well stocked 'with the forbidden liquid. They make great claims to honesty and insist that public officials and others be honest, and at the same time they are parties to cruel and oppressive schemes that burden the people. They have the outward appearance of purity and try to impress the people with their own ‘purity’, and yet they constantly support devilish schemes to bring oppression, suffering and death upon the people. Therefore the Lord said of them: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and [clergymen], hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”—Matt. 23: 25-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the funeral of some man of prominence, particularly if he is a member of the “false prophet” class, these clergymen perform ceremonies of outward solemnity and great piety; while in the cemetery and vicinity of the tombs of other men -who have died they “garnish” them with flowers, and with uplifted hands and solemn faces say concerning others that sleep in the dust and who shed blood unrighteously: “Had we been of their day, we would not have been partakers in their wrongful deeds.’ In other words, they would make those who stand by understand that they, the clergy, are good and great and lovable men and do not the deeds of blood, while at the same time the blood of many soldiers who died in the World War cries out from the earth against them. It was the clergymen who urged many of these young men into the war, and therefore their blood is upon them. (Jer. 2: 34) Jesus says of them: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because yc build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (Matt. 23:29-33) Let it be borne in mind in this connection that it was the clergy that caused the persecution, vile punishment and death of many of God’s witnesses during the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the words above quoted Jesus spoke prophetically against the clergy and the ‘principal of their flocks’, which prophecy has had a partial fulfilment but much of which is yet to be fulfilled. It is well known that during the World War the clergymen used their meetinghouses or synagogues as a place for recruiting young men for the army, and sent them forth to die; at the same time they were inciting tlpe people to mob violence against humble men and women who were teaching the Word of God concerning His kingdom. At that time the World War was furnishing much extraneous evidence of the fulfilment of prophecy showing the presence of the Lord and the time for His kingdom, and God sent these messages to the people, and particularly to the clergy; and instead of hearing the Word of the Lord they ill-used His witnesses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>GOLDEN AGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore Jesus says of them: “Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and, scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Bara.chias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily, I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.” (Matt. 23:34-36) This prophetic utterance had a miniature fulfilment upon the Jews, but its far greater fulfilment is soon to be upon the clergy of “organized Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now we are in “the last days”. The great issue joined now is, Shall the earth be ruled by the scheme of the League of Nations, or shall Jehovah God and His Christ rule the earth? The clergy have taken their stand on the side of the League of Nations and given their allegiance to Satan’s scheme and are against God and His kingdom. (Ps. 2:2) By their practice of hypocrisy they have induced the commercial and political rulers to follow a wrongful course. Now let the people judge whether or not the facts that are well known to all exactly fit the clergy as set forth in the following statement of the Word of God: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall ba lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hypocrisy is the greatest crime ever committed. In the land of so-called “Christendom” has been the place of the most widespread commission and practice of hypocrisy, and the clergy and the ‘principal ones of their flock’ have been the chief perpetrators of the crime. “Organized Christianity” is therefore the most stupendous scheme of hypocrisy ever promulgated or used on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Organized Christianity” has turned its ear away from the law or Word of God and adopted modernism as its doctrine, money as its god, and the League of Nations as its kingdom. “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law [of God], even his prayer [is] abomination.” (Prov. 28:9; Isa. 1:13) The leaders of Christendom, to wit, the clergy, love to pray in public assemblies and to speak flattering titles and to receive praise of men; and this is likewise an abomination in the sight of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The desire of the “organized Christian religion” is for power and influence, and her insatiable desire and passion therefor has caused her to commit fornication with the rulers of the world; and that is an abomination in the sight of God. “Christendom,” or “organized Christianity”, has taken counsel against God and His kingdom and allied itself with the League of Nations and set it up as a substitute for God’s kingdom, which is the great abomination and that one ‘that maketh desolate’.—Matt. 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An immoral woman named Babylon is used by the Scriptures to represent Satan’s organization which gives birth to hypocritical religion. “Organized Christianity” bears the name of her mother Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The original name “Bab-il” means “gate to god”, because it was the Devil’s religion by ■which the people were induced to worship him as their god. The Hebrew word “Babel” means “confusion”, because it was there that God confused the lip or language of the peoples of the earth. (Gen. 11:9) There has never been a Devil religion so confusing as that labeled, in the world, “organized Christianity” or “Christian, religion”. There are divers and numerous so-called “Christian organizations”, made up of Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics, Church of England (also called Catholic), Lutheran reformations, Presbyterians, Baptists, and numerous others, all having or holding some doctrine peculiar to themselves, and all of which are confusing beyond human understanding. Millions have been so confused with these conflicting claims of “Christendom” that they have not known which way to turn. In each nation that is called “Christian” there is something different about the religion of their nation called by the same name. Jehovah God is not the god of confusion. (1 Cor. 14:33) And this is conclusive proof that “organized Christianity” is the Devil’s religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The commercial and political element that rule the country well know that the religion practiced by the various denominations is not sincere and that it dishonors God. Why longer give support to hypocrisy? Separate yourselves from the hypocritical religion and let your stand be honest before God and men. Then the people will have more confidence in your efforts to do something for them. Why should the people be longer passive and lend support to hypocrisy? You cannot serve God and the Devil at the same time. You are in bondage to a hypocritical religion now. In the language of Jesus Christ, ‘The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">truth alone shall make you free.’ Free yourselves, therefore, by breaking away from hypocritical teachers, and boldly and fearlessly take your stand on the side of God and of Christ and the truth. Be honest and sincere with yourselves and before God. The kingdom of God and His Christ is at hand. They who are first to give allegiance thereto will be the first to receive the blessings of the Lord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The gentleman who found the cards said in his letter of transmittal something that if not . of interest to the “Rt. Rev. Bishop” or the “Local Pastor” might conceivably be of interest to others:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I found the enclosed forms in San Antonio a few days ago; possibly you might be able to find the rightful owner through the medium of your valuable magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I used to hold the agencies of one or two insurance companies myself, some years ago, and after studying the cards I realize the value from a business standpoint of having the ‘Local Pastor’ and also the ‘lit. Rev. Bishop’ taking a hand in the game. In ease of the death of the insured, of course the church would know just how much ready cash the beneficiary would have and might be induced to part with to pay for masses for the ‘dear departed’. But what I am most interested in is just what split-up there is in the commission, if any, among the agent, the ‘Local Pastor’ and the ‘Rt. Rev. Bishop’. This would be valuable information to me in case I should again take up any agencies.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8"> FRIEND who subscribes for your paper has sent to us several articles re the poison in aluminum. My husband has ulcers; so we at once became interested in your articles. After much deliberation, we decided to discard our aluminum saucepans. We made tests and found quite a sediment in water boiled in the aluminum saucepans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will bo exactly four weeks next Monday since we discarded our aluminum ware, and the last two weeks have noted a decided improvement in my husband’s condition; so much so</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">N spite of the fact that for the last two months these books have been produced at the rate of sixteen thousand daily, five and a half days each week, at the present time we have more orders than we can fill. Why is this ? Simply because the people who have already received LIGHT are telling others about it. For nearly 2000 years the Book of Revelation, written in highly symbolical language, has been a sealed book. Now, because the time is ripe, LIGHT unlocks the seals and an amazingly satisfactory and complete explanation emerges to view. You will know it is right when you read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of those who have read LIGHT are placing orders for large quantities so that they maybe privileged to distribute these during the</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">750,000 TESTIMONIES WEEK</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark59"></a>September 27 to October 5</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">During this week these Christian people, thoroughly interested in the truth that God provides, are going to make an earnest endeavor to reach 750,000 people in the United States and tell them concerning God’s Kingdom, and offer to each individual they meet LIGHT, Books I- and II, because they believe it contains a message of vital importance to every thinking person. In addition they will have the PROHIBITION booklet by Judge Rutherford, a subject that has caused nation-wide discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why not join in with this great throng during that week and tell your friends, about LIGHT and PROHIBITION? Order your LIGHT and PROHIBITION books early, that you too may have a part in this witness for God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, if you have not read LIGHT or PROHIBITION by Judge Rutherford, why not write to us immediately? We will send you postpaid the two books LIGHT and the booklet, all for 95 cents. Address</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Emerald Isle</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">RELAND is about the size of the state of South</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Carolina. Its highlands are chiefly along the coast; the greater part of the interior is a plain. The highest mountain, Carrantuohill, in Kerry, near the Lakes of Killarney, is 3,414 feet. Most of the mountains have the appearance, not of peaks, but of rounded hills. On the western coast the Atlantic currents have worn awmy the land in many places, causing fiords such as exist on the coast of Norway and other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rivers form excellent navigable channels. Vast sums have been expended in removing the rocky shoals from these and making artificial cuts for the purpose of avoiding them. Canals in Ireland, as elsewhere, have sunk to a condition of secondary importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Giant’s Causeway in the north is one of the geographical wonders of the world. In this grim headland there are 40,000 pillars of basalt, most of them as neatly polished as if the work had been done by human hands or the finest abrasive machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Iron ore exists in nearly every county. There is copper of excellent quality in the western mountains; also gold and silver in small quantities. Anthracite coal exists, but not to any great extent. There are also marble, old red sandstone and carboniferous limestone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The deer, bear, wildcat, ivolf, beaver and cattle peculiar to the island which once roamed over the Emerald Isle have all disappeared, and there are no snakes or toads. Ireland is still a paradise for fishermen. The Dublin Horse Show (managed by an Englishman, by the way) is -world famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Early History</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Plutarch called Ireland by the name Ogygia, meaning “very ancient”. Aristotle referred to it as lerne. Pliny, Cassar and other authors mention the Druids (demon-worshipers) whose philosophies and so-called “sciences” prevailed in the reign of Eochy the First, more than a thousand years before the birth of Christ. Society was then classified into seven grades, each marked by the number of colors in its dress. Men of learning were, by law, privileged to rank next to royalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries Ireland was ruled over by the sons of Milesius, king of Spain, and by their descendants up to the time of the Norman-Welsh invasion in 1170. Hence the name “Milesians”. England entered Ireland by decree of Adrian IV, who sold the country and its people to King Henry II of England fifteen years previous for fifteen cents a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Round Towers of Ireland have created much discussion. There are 100 of them, 18 in perfect condition. Their average size is 100 feet in height, circumference at base 50 feet, walls </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3y<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font5"> feet thick. The interior is divided into as many as eight stories. It is believed that these towers are of an age antedating the Christian era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The king of Ireland from 1002 to 1014 was Brian Born. The O’Briens and many other distinguished Irish families claim this man as their ancestor. The Celtic name of Ireland was Innis-fail, Isle of Destiny. The Greek name Eire or lerne later evolved into Erin. The early Roman waiters called it Hibernia. Tradition has it that with the sinking of Atlantis a great part of Ireland was swallowed up by the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Later History</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England made the fatal mistake of trying to rule the Irish by force. The penal laws were aimed at breaking the spirit of the Irish Catholics and reducing them to the position of a subject race. One who has ever tried to force an Irishman to do anything would instinctively know w-hat happened, wnthout ever taking the trouble to read the pages of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Act of 1793, and especially the Act of 1829, modified the severity of English rule and admitted Catholics into Parliament. Still later the breaking up of the holdings of the large landowners, and their distribution among the peasant proprietors made conditions more livable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sinn Fein (“We Ourselves”) arose in war time. In April, 1916, it seized the heart of Dublin and proclaimed Ireland a republic. But England still controlled, and arrested 3,400 men and 79 women. There were many executions and imprisonments, but peace refused to come. Disorder prevailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In December, 1918, the Sinn Fein won most of the Irish seats in the House of Commons and, instead of proceeding to Westminster, met in Dublin as a Dail Eireann (Irish Assembly), adopted a formal declaration, of independence and demanded admission to the Peace Conference at Paris, which was refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There followed tragic burnings in Cork, Balbriggan, Belfast, Lisburn and other cities: the wreckage of creameries, factories and private houses. Over two thousand houses were utterly destroyed and about fifteen hundred more were partially wrecked, so that some three thousand fa</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font5">lies were rendered homeless. In Belfast, for a time, ten thousand workers were forcibly prevented from earning their living. When Cork was burned five thousand people had to be relieved. The land was in anarchy and a change was inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Division Occurs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the Government of Ireland Act of 1920 as amended by the Free State Act of 1922 Ireland was divided politically into two parts, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. On December 6, 1922, the Free State was established by royal proclamation, the swearing in of Timothy M. Healy as governor-general and the meeting of the Parliament (Oireachtas).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The constitution which was adopted declares the Free State a coequal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth, and deriving its authority from the people of Ireland. The northern part of the island, commonly known as Ulster, was separated from the rest of the country and made a self-governing province. Only local matters are considered by the latter parliament, imperial questions being handled in London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was hard for the people of Southern Ireland to agree to having Ulster cut off. The new government in the south followed only after an interminable debate, and even so the vote of acceptance showed the narrow majority of 64 to 57. Without doubt, to this day, the majority of Irish people regret the conditions that seemed to make division expedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The historical origin of the Ulster problem, and of the term Scotch-Irish, is that in 1609, six years after the accession of James VI of Scotland as James I of England, there was a Scotch occupation of the North of Ireland. There had been previous implantations of Protestant settlers in the reign of Elizabeth. These settlements were accompanied by much cruelty to the Catholic population supplanted, and the bad feeling then engendered has been handed down from one generation to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish Free State has a total area of 17,024,481 acres, and a population of three million. The capital and largest city, Dublin, had in 1926 a population of 418,981. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ulster has a total area of 3,353,754 acres, and a population of a million and a quarter. The capital and largest city, Belfast, had in 1926 a population of 415.151, almost the same as Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Northern Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the area of the six counties, Antrim, Down, Armagh, Tyrone, Derry and Fermanagh, which, with the cities of Belfast and Derry, constitute the self-governing province of Northern Ireland, are to be found nine-tenths of the manufacturing industries of all Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In respect to agriculture it may be said that this is carried on more intensively here than in any other part of the country. Almost DO percent of the total area is productive. It contains onefourth of the total plowed land in all Ireland, half the entire fruit crop, and more than three-fourths of the flax crop. Ulster is of about the size of Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no physical features to make for a division between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Thus it seems too bad that two expensive administrations must be kept up. But there are economic and cultural barriers. Northern Ireland objects to the compulsory study of Gaelic in the schools, to the forbidding of divorce and to the protective tariff. Belfast makes linens and ships, and there is no market in Ireland for either. And then there is the everpresent problem of Calvinism and Catholicism. All these items make for division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, one cannot motor far in Northern Ireland in any direction without being brought to the boundary and without realizing how much Ireland, like every other part of the world, needs the One Government now functioning, namely Christ’s Government, the Kingdom of God in the earth. All the rest of these governments must go, and the time of their departure is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lovable Irish</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a saying that, “If you meet a man that everybody loves and nobody respects, that is an Irishman: if you meet a man that everybody respects and nobody loves, that is a Scotchman: if you meet a man that nobody either loves or respects, that is an Englishman.” The saying is pretty hard on the English, but it leaves the Irish in a delightful place, for everybody likes to be loved, and it goes without saying that many of the Irish are as worthy of respect as anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish are so full of fun that they do not mind putting themselves in a position to be laughed at. They like to see other people happy. They are full of sympathy. Who is so quick to show the kindness inherent in a benevolent soul as are the Irish when sorrow or trouble enters a home ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish drink too much Irish whisky. No doubt. And the Scotch drink too much Scotch whisky. And others in other lands do the same. They do too much fighting. And so do the Italians and the Poles and others. They do too much bragging. And so do the Yankees, the Canadians and others. But they are nevertheless lovable. And so are all the others mentioned, if one looks at them with kindly eyes and wants to see their good traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Austin O’Malley described the Irish in one of his books by saying, “The Irishman is the human enthymeme—all extremes and no middle.” That is merely another way of describing Irish enthusiasm. This enthusiasm manifests itself in everything into which they enter, religion, politics, etc., with a fervor and intensity of feeling which often make a calm discussion of issues impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For denying that Ireland is poor, and for-accusing her of being an incorrigible beggar, George Bernard Shaw, himself an Irishman, has become a prophet without honor in his own country. By quite a large majority, namely 25 to 8, the University of Dublin has refused to confer upon him an academic distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Blarney Stone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ireland is a land of traditions, and the enthusiasm of the Irish people helps to keep these traditions alive. The gift of eloquence is supposed to come from kissing the Blarney stone. Almost every tourist to Southern Ireland goes at least to see it. To kiss it is another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true stone is triangular in shape. It bears the inscription, “Cormack MacCarthy Fortis Me Fieri Fecit, A.D. 1446.” To kiss it one must bend his body through an opening, twist his head and shoulders, turn his neck and kiss the stone on the under side. Formerly, the only way it could be kissed was for one to be held by the heels through an opening in the parapet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is claimed by some that kissing the Blarney stone enables one to deviate from veracity whenever one desires, without betraying it by blushing. Be that as it may, it is also claimed that an attendant at the castle, encouraged with a sixpence, sometimes shows a bogus Blarney stone to seekers after notoriety who lack the courage to kiss the real one. It would seem that he himself must have kissed the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Natural Garden Spot</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The warm, moist winds from the Atlantic blowing over Ireland make its mean temperature from 20° to 30° F. higher than that of other places in the same latitude on the eastern coast of America or the interior of Europe. It is even a few degrees warmer than in places in the same latitude on the west coast of America. The humidity enables delicate plants to flourish with vigor in the open air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The soil of Ireland will always be rich, on account of the constant erosion of limestone. There is also a large amount of vegetable mold, which forms one of the most important ingredients of the soil. The result is a vast extent of arable surface, covered with a deep friable loam of remarkable richness. The forest trees continue to retain their leaves after similiar trees in the warmest parts of England have lost all their foliage. Grass grows luxuriantly everywhere, making the Emerald Isle a joy to the eyes wherever it is seen. The lightness of the soil makes tillage easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The holdings or farms have been divided and subdivided until they have been reduced to the smallest patches. The bogs, useless for tillage, furnish peat for fuel. Mismanagement of the forests has made it one of the most poorly forested areas in Europe; but reforestry is under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Agriculture the Principal Occupation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a land such as Ireland it is inevitable that agriculture will always be the principal occupation. At the present time more than two-thirds of all occupied persons are directly engaged in it, or are employed in industries which depend mainly on agriculture for raw materials. Three-fourths of the wealth produced comes directly or indirectly from the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ireland has turned away from the raising of cereal crops and is definitely committed to the production of beef, bacon, butter and eggs. She aims to give the British consumers the best values to be had in these. Irish prosperity depends wholly on British prosperity, for Britain is her natural and almost only market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Privately owned creameries are rapidly disappearing, their places being taken by the cooperative creamery. There are now 1,040 cooperative farmers’ societies, comprising creameries, credit banks, poultry associations, etc., with 100,000 members. State aid is afforded to persons engaged in agriculture by means of an Agricultural Credit Corporation with a capital of £500,000. The Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction supplies traveling lecturers who give instruction in all branches of agriculture, dairying, beekeeping and stockraising. Government inspection and grading of butter aims to improve the quality. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The departure of British troops from &quot;the island has not been wholly a good thing for Ireland. While they were there they originated a considerable market for horses, and for fodder and other agricultural products. Still, it is better not to have that kind of market than to have it. The withdrawal of the troops has cut off many visitors w’ho used to come and spend considerable money. However, it would be hard to build up a great tourist trade in Ireland until the country is better supplied with good hotels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While Ireland is still poor, there is evidence that her farmers are getting ahead. The Civic Guard, as the police are now called, are unarmed. They are recruited largely from the same class as the old Boyal Irish Constabulary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Land Purchase Act of 1903, a very famous and wise act whereby the tenants may buy the farms and become independent of the landlords, is still functioning splendidly. The government guarantees the payment at the ruling rate of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is well known in American schools that the Irish boys and girls are able to hold their own with anybody, but in Ireland itself the constant intrusion of religion into public affairs has given Irish education a bad name. The trouble dates back hundreds of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The laws of the time of William II and Queen Anne made it a crime for Catholics to teach or to have their children taught by Catholics, or to send them abroad where they would be educated in Catholic schools. The rigid enforcement of these laws, and the attempt thus made to compel the people to abandon the Boman Catholic church, resulted in a large proportion of illiteracy, which has had its effect upon the people to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until the time of the establishment of the Free State, the management of each school, and the power of appointing and dismissing the teacher, was in the hands of the parish priest or the parish rector, according as the school was Catholic or Protestant. At present, in the Free State, most of the teaching is conducted by religious orders, and lay teachers can find employment only in an inferior capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Primary education is at present administered by the two governments functioning in Ireland. The Northern government has its own education department, and the Free State has charge of primary education in its territory. Education in the primary grades is free and compulsory, but the attendance law is poorly enforced. The result is that many of the farmers’ sons who come to hear the lectures of agricultural experts have not enough education to enable them to take full advantage of the instruction given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Cosgrave, president of the Free State, modestly says: “Politically we suffer because so many of the electors are hardly emerged from the folk state of mind. Their fathers and grandfathers were fed on folk tales, legends of the King of Ireland’s Son or the Finn Ma Cool and other errors of folk lore. We have to spend a great deal of money on education because Ave are so poor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Progress is being made. The organization of the farmers into agricultural and credit societies is an educational work of first magnitude. Matters have also been helped by amalgamating all the railroad companies into one, though this form of education is dearly bought in most instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Telltown Fair has been revived. Established some three thousand years ago, and now lapsed for many centuries, this fair was once a center of legislation, poetry and the arts, as ■well as for merchandise, games and sports. The Irish name of the fair is Oenach Tailteann.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of similar import is the Feis Ceoil, the equivalent in Ireland of the Eisteddfodd of Wales. In 1928 there were one thousand entrants at the Feis Ceoil held in Dublin. The ballad singers have almost disappeared from the Irish fairs. These ballad singers, in bygone years, had much to do with keeping Ireland in turmoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion in Ulster &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The latest figures for Ulster are that there are 420,428 Roman Catholics, 338,724 Protestant Episcopalians, 393,374 Presbyterians,49,554 Methodists, and 54,481 of other professions. The Presbyterian Church of Ireland, centered chiefly in the counties of Down and Antrim, is the dominant political force of Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1798 the Presbyterians of Antrim were the leading spirits in an attempt to establish an Irish republic, but the British government of that day cleverly drove a wedge between the Presbyterians and all others, giving them preferential treatment, with the result that Ulster gradually became violently pro-empire and antihome rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Relations between Catholics and Protestants in Ulster are much better now than in former* years, despite the fact that there is almost no intercourse between the two, as respects education, and they are virtually forbidden to intermarry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the agricultural and industrial wealth of Northern Ireland is in Protestant hands, which complicates the matter of maintaining the happiest of relations. There is prejudice and bitterness on both sides, but the 12th of last July, the festival of Orange Ulster, came and went this year without the usual stone-throwing and fisticuffs, and for that everybody ought to be glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion in Free State</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious professions in the Free State, according to the census of 1911 (later figures not available) showed 2,812,509 Roman Catholics, 249,535 Protestant Episcopalians, 45,486 Presbyterians, 16,440 Methodists, and 15,718 of other faiths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though Ireland is less than one-third the size of the state of Colorado, yet it has a Roman Catholic hierarchy of four archbishops, 1,087 parishes, and 3,688 priests. It has 543 convents, and many monasteries. It has more mitred prelates than has Germany, which has a population many times as large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Jesuit writer, having visited Ireland, on being asked how he found the priests in Ireland, replied: “The priests of Ireland? There is nobody but priests in Ireland. They are treading on one another’s toes.” Of course that was stretching it some, but there are so many that they exercise a predominant influence in every matter that comes up for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the Protestants are few (only about one in nine), they stand well in the communities in which they live. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> says: “Roughly, 50 percent of the members of the learned professions and executive heads of business firms are Protestants, and the same figure applies to chartered accountants. Already in the Free State in two or three of the principal government departments at least half of the men of the staff were born on the northern side of the border.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Patrick</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Ripley, of cartoon fame, recently stirred things considerably by mentioning that “Saint Patrick” was not a Roman Catholic, that his name was not Patrick? and that he was not born in Ireland. These and other statements which he stoutly defended seem supported by the histories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Saint Patrick’s” father was a Roman magistrate by the name of Calpornius, and lived in the village of Bannavem Taberniae, not far from Kilpatrick, Scotland. Where his father lived it is assumed “St. Patrick” was born. His mother, Conchessa, was French, and a superior woman. Patrick may have been born in France before Conchessa moved to Scotland. The facts on this are not knowm. History does not clear up for us why the 17th day of March is celebrated as “'St. Patrick’s birthday”, as it is not certainly known that he was born on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patrick was born A.D. 389, and died at the age of 72. For six years he v<sup>T</sup>as held as a slave in Ireland, and years after voluntarily returned, as a missionary to that people, and conducted the most successful and aggressive work of the fifth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Patrick’s writings there is no mention of the pope, purgatory, confession, transubstantia-tion, or worship of the virgin. He said not a word about ever being in Rome or appointed by the pope. He was a devout, energetic Christian missionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Post Sargent thinks the story of Patrick’s driving the snakes out of Ireland must have arisen from the fact that Patrick, after his escape from captivity, took refuge in the island cloister of Lerinus. In the beginning, Lerinus had been infested by snakes, so that no man could live there. Honoratus, a monk, took possession of it, drove out the snakes and reclaimed it for cultivation. Hence the confusion. Probably the snakes were all gone by the time Patrick reached there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Making Gaelic Compulsory</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ancient Irish language, Gaelic, is spoken in the seaboard, district on the south coast of Ireland and includes the counties of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. This is the root language of the British Isles. A native of Cornwall, England, can understand one who speaks in Gaelic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not until 1892 that the Gaelic League came into existence. It is doubtful if at that time the people who spoke only Irish numbered 20,GOO. The Gaelic League, by an appeal to Irish pride, is actually reviving a language that was virtually dead. Today the acquisition of a knowledge of Gaelic has become the badge of patriotism, and though the government may not approve all the effort and expense to turn an entire nation over to a new language, yet there seems to be no way out; for if the government lags in the work of change it incurs the wrath of the pro-Irish patriots and their intense opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gaelic League does not intend that there shall be any let-down in the drive to make Ireland a Gaelic-speaking nation. Their intent is to make the language compulsory under heavy penalties in all spheres of life. Some of the Gaelic now being spoken in the Dail or parliament is pretty bad Gaelic, hardly understandable ; nevertheless, although English is the universal tongue, it is under the ban of the patriot’s displeasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today the Irish child goes to school, learns Irish grammar and texts, and comes home rarely to speak the language again. In youth, if he goes to the movies, which have now become the talkies, it is English that he sees and hears. When he matures, if he does any considerable business it must be with Britain, and the British talk his own tongue, English. Looks as if the revival of Gaelic had a hard road before it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Irish is compulsory in the elementary schools, and is an essential subject for admittance to the Civil Service and other public employment. It is also compulsory for lawyers. But the disadvantage of learning Irish is that it is of no use at all in any other part of the world than Ireland and if a boy emigrates he has burdened his mind with a useless language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no textbooks in Gaelic suitable to advanced students, and Gaelic equivalents must still be found for scientific and abstract terms. The cost of providing good university textbooks in Gaelic has been set at about $10,000,000, which is far beyond the means of the Free State to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most Gaelic literature is in manuscript form and not published. This literature will now be collected and published, at the rate of one book a week. A small sum has been set aside for this purpose. Oddly enough, the greatest Gaelic scholar of the last generation was a German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No great prosperity can come to Ireland while it is divided, yet there is no indication that the Northern Protestant population would ever accept Gaelic, and it is certain that the Ulster Protestant living in the Free State feels dissatisfied to send his children to schools in which the Gaelic language is compulsory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Few Political Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Northern Irish parliament consists of a senate of two appointed and twenty-four elected members and a house of commons of 52 elected members, the latter continuing for five years. Northern Ireland also returns thirteen members to the imperial house of commons at Westminster. Matters of imperial concern, postal service, post office, savings banks, stamp designs, etc., are handled at Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Northern Ireland is finding it hard to carry the load of what might be called a useless government. When this government was started it was hoped to send £7,000,000 every year to the imperial treasury, but it cannot be done. Not even a seventh of it can be paid. Increases in pensions, unemployment insurance, costs of education and social service have all contributed to make the government much trouble financially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turning now to the Free State: It is doubtful if any government in the world ever consulted as carefully about its constitution, and tried to get the best out of all constitutions, as it was done in this instance. Every country in the world was called upon for something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Drafting Committee went to the United States for its ideas upon ministerial control and responsibility,, but as the machine of government has actually functioned it has approximated more and more closely to the British parliamentary model. All the ministers are members of parliament, though they need not be, and they are all members of one party. Numerous changes in the constitution have been necessary, as was to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The parliament of the Free State (Oireachtas) consists of the king and two houses, a senate (Seanad) and a chamber of deputies (Dail). All men and women over twenty-one years of age have a vote and may become candidates for the Dail. Members of the senate must be thirty years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish Free State is a coequal member of the British Commonwealth of nations, of the same status as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The king of Britain is the king of all and the king of each. By a pleasant fiction every act of the state is esteemed to be the act of the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no such thing as president of the Irish Free State. The president of the executive council is elected by the Dail Eireann and holds that post by the votes of his fellow members, and not by popular suffrage. That explains why his resignation as president of the council does not involve a general election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty and the Censorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a typically Irish “bull” that a people that love liberty as much as the Irish, and have fought so incessantly to obtain it, should maintain a censorship in time of peace. The censorship board contains a Protestant clergyman, a Catholic priest, and three others. The priest, Bev. Canon Boyland, of Maynooth College, is the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Galway library committee, working sympathetically with the objectives of the censorship board, has ordered the burning of books of Arnold Bennett, Victor Hugo, Maeterlinck, Tolstoy and others. Other writers, including George Bernard Shaw, have been removed from the shelves of the library, and the sanction of the committee must be obtained before they may be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first two months of its operation the Irish censorship law barred six newspapers and fifteen books. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The People</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Empire News,</span><span class="font5"> both London publications, have printed special Irish editions, to enable them to sell their papers in the Emerald Isle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In their desire to have a very Irish Ireland, a people of all one religion and all one tongue, and in their determination to curtail freedom and restrain liberty of the mind, the people of the Irish Free State have made a very great error, and one which has cost them many valuable citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">William T. Cosgrave</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Liam T. MaeOosgair (Gaelic for William T. Cosgrave) has remained in office since the birth of the Irish Free State, and is thus the dean of European premiers. Before the fighting that led up to the Free State he was a Dublin greengrocer and licensed victualer. At 29 years of age he was a member of the Dublin Corporation: at 35 he was chairman of its finance committee; and at 42 he was president of the executive council of the Irish Free State. He is now 50 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At age 36 he was one of the leaders of the 1,000 who took up arms against the British government in the Easter, 1916, gesture for independence. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was later released. Mr. Cosgrave has made a good man for the position he fills, and' commands universal respect. Ills wit and common sense have made him a favorite among his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">De Valera, the Great Mischief-Maker</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eamonn de Valera was born in the United States. His mother was an Irish-American, and his father a Spaniard. As a result of his part in the Irish rebellion of 1916 he was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. He was released under the amnesty of 1917. Iio became a member of parliament, but, in common with all Sinn Fein M.P.’s, refused to sit at Westminster, and in 1917 was elected president of the Irish republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. de Valera is an orator of great ability. In 1920, largely as a result of his eloquent pleas, $2,538,038 was collected from Irish sympathisers in the United States, with which he intended to partially finance the Irish republic. About 40 percent of this money was used, and with the dissipation of Mr. de Valera’s dream, the remaining 60 percent has been returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. de Valera and his friends are disesteemed by many because they solemnly swore true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the Irish Free State and to the king of Britain and thereby committed perjury, as their speeches plainly show. One of Mr. de Valera’s friends boasted that when he took the oath he pushed the Bible as far away from him as he could, not wishing to have God too near him while he was signing the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. de Valera and his associates make much political capital out of the fact that tenants may buy the farms and become independent of the landlords, yet this wise legislation, passed by the British away back in 1903, has done more for the Irish people than any single act ever passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. de Valera would have the annual payments on these farms held for the use of the Irish Free State, instead of being sent to AVest-minster. This complete separation from Britain sounds well to many Irish ears, but means little in practice, because if these annuities are not paid to England in accordance with the treaty settlement, the British government could still recover them by taxing Irish products. Mr. de Valera’s eloquence will never change the natural location of Ireland with respect to its market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many men who greatly admire Mr. de Valera’s courage, and are impressed by his eloquence, are nevertheless fully convinced that his policy of complete separation from England could never be attained without bloodshed and economic ruin for Ireland. De Valera’s extremist policies cause his frequent arrest. Not having the majority of the Irish with him he has had to succumb or fill the country with terror by lending open or secret support to movements calculated to plunge the whole country into disorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Where Extremism Leads</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extremism, as advocated by De Valera, leads to crime, whether he personally condones it or not. It has been responsible in the last two years for men’s being shot in the stomach when opening the door at night in response to a knock. It has caused the stabbing of a woman in the back and the threatening of jurors and the attacking of people by masked men in the public road for no other offense than being British subjects or tolerating Protestantism. The sad part of it is that in many of these cases the legitimate government itself does nothing about the crimes, no doubt fearing the stigma attaching to things British or Protestant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A citizen not yet subdued writes to British friends that whenever he has been attacked and has applied for police protection, the police official promises to come every time, but never comes. He says: “I have known him after eight applications to explain that he was too busy, and I have seen him during official hours on the same day boating on a lake for pleasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President Cosgrave has on occasion caused the swift and sudden arrest of armed and criminal extremists, and he and his fellow officers of the government are guarded night and day to prevent assassination. Even then the assassinations occur, as witness the sad death of Kevin O’Higgins, vice president, shot down in cold blood on his way to church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President Cosgrave is a calm-tempered and philosophically-minded man. He compares the present with the past and says hopefully: “The fact is that the Irish people in general are one of the most law-abiding peoples in the world. If you want proof of this you have only to compare the statistics of serious crime in Ireland with those of other countries, but not excluding England. It must be remembered, too, that the percentage of crime detection in this country is very high. It is quite true that a conspiracy exists to prevent the detection and punishment of a certain type of crime which masquerades under the cloak of politics. The numbers engaged in this conspiracy are very small. The majority of men are well known to the police and their movements are under constant surveillance.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Citizens of the United States, the crime center of the world, can obviously not have much to say about crime in Ireland, but most of the crimes in Ireland seem to be leveled at either the British or the Protestants, or at both, and to find expression in ways that are not pleasant to read. Thus the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> reports one. of these crimes, as follotvs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thirty Londonderry girls en route to Leenan last night, where they were going to dance with British soldiers, were stopped by a band of armed and masked men near Clonmany and stripped of their coats, hats and shoes. The bus in which the girls were riding was stopped and the girls’ apparel was taken from them and burned. The men then compelled the bus driver to proceed, leaving the girls to walk home. [A dirty, low, Irish trick.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bitter prejudice against things British and things Protestant is constantly fanned by somebody. The present Irish police force does not carry arms of any kind, and does not need to do so, because, as respects Catholics and Irishmen, the country is safe enough for anybody. But the Protestants, the chief taxpayers, have come to feel that they are not well protected, and thousands of them have left the country, to its injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A hint of the situation is seen in the fact that the government has had to introduce a bill for the protection of juries, and that in county Monaghan a motion that applicants for work should not be discriminated against because of their religious faith failed to pass. Five Protestants voted for it, and seventeen Catholics against it. Nevertheless, the Irish minister of finance, Mr. Blythe, is a Presbyterian, born in Bister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Emigration</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1841 the population of Ireland numbered 8,000,000. Since then it has constantly declined. The Dublin Weekly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Times</span><span class="font5"> refers to the veritable processions to the emigrant ports as constituting a symbol of national suicide. More than 30,000 of the best men go away annually, about 26,000 of them to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The emigration has dropped off some, and in the year ending June 30, 1929, the Irish Free State was the only European country 'which did not send its full quota to the United States. The emigration is not only from the South, in which the number of Protestants has decreased by 106,000, but since the division in 1922 the emigration from the northern part of the country has amounted to 70,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The decrease of population is partly accounted for by the withdrawal of the British troops and their dependents, numbering about 34,000; more than 24,000 killed in the war: about the same number of officers and men who settled abroad after the Avar, and more than 8,000 members of the Irish constabulary that have left the country. These explanations, hotvever, hardly account for the general decline of population since the middle of the last century, Avhich d.ecline has been Avithout a parallel in any country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1921 there Avere 1,817,457 native-born. Irishmen living in foreign countries. This is 43 percent of Ireland’s population. Of them, 1,037,234 are in the United States, 367,174 in England and Wales, 159,020 in Scotland, 105,033 in Australia, 34,419 in </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ngaa<sup>7</sup></span><span class="font5"> Zealand, 12,289 in the Union of South Africa, and 8,414 in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About 600 landlords have gone from Ireland for ever, but in their stead are 300,000 tenants who OAvn their holdings. This OAvnership ought to keep the younger generation at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Free State sets its income tax at tAvo-thirds the British rate. This is done with the hope of luring some rich Britishers to live in the Emerald Isle, and seems a pretty good piece of statecraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free State Cost of Government ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Considering all the disadvantages under winch they have had to labor, the administrators of the Free State government seem to have done remarkably well. Some British critics comment caustically on the fact that while the productive power of Free State taxpayers has fallen and is still falling, their cost of government has gone up from an average of £7,000,000 to one of £30,000,000 and their cost of living in a Connaught village is 14 percent higher than in Manchester, where the average family income is seA<sup>7</sup>eral times as much. The critic cited, namely, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The English Review,</span><span class="font5"> says pessimistically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase in their permanent taxation in excess of the estimates for normal years is now more than tAvice the total of the net revenue collected from the Free State area for an average of 20 years under the Union from 1894 to 1914. Though economizing this year, the Government have to find £25,000,000. They cannot find it. They must make up the deficit by borrowing. They have never balanced a budget yet and never will, unless bjr a drastic overhauling of the whole scheme for Avliich no party seems prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Against this pessimistic outlook a friendly critic makes some observations that ought properly to be considered. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review </span><span class="font5">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They found themselves obliged to pay enormous sums in damages to the many people w’ho had suffered injuries to property and person during the period of the Irish Avar against England, and they were only a short time in office when they had to foot the bill for a campaign of destruction by the opponents of the treaty which ran into millions of pounds. Competent authorities have placed it at over £40,000.000, nearly twice the total annual revenue of the Free State. Not merely had money to be spent in makinggood the damage, but a large army had to be kept up at an enormous outlay to enforce order and secure respect for the law. That army has now been reduced but the Free State is only slowly recovering from the disasters of those early years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font5"> in a friendly review of the Free State’s financial position, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering the fact that the Free State was born on the morrow of four years of civil warfare, during which trade and industry were largely paralyzed and millions of pounds in property destroyed, the present financial position of the country is remarkably sound. The first national loan was over-subscribed the day it was opened and is now quoted above par. A second loan for £15,000,000, a very large sum in a country with a total annual revenue of less than £25,000,000, was authorized two years ago. The first half was issued in Dublin and New York. The American quota of £4,000,000 was taken up within twenty-four hours, while Dublin absorbed its £3,000,000 in a day and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The national debt for the Irish Free State was, on March 31, 1929, approximately $144,057,450, or equivalent to $47.50 per capita, as compared with $818 for Great Britain, $298 for Australia and $146 for South Africa. One-eighth of the State’s entire receipts from taxes goes to old-age pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Northern Ireland Industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Northern Ireland has six of the largest manufacturing concerns in the world. All the vessels of the White Star Line are built at Belfast. Twenty-one vessels were launched in 1914, with a gross tonnage of 239,819, not including warships. Later statistics are not available, but it is known that the Belfast yards employ 20,000 men and boys and are the largest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ulster has also the largest flax and linen mills in the world, the largest thread spinning factory, the largest rope works and the largest single tobacco factory. The Belfast rope works employ over 3,500 persons and can produce 350 tons of ropes and twines a. week. The less said about Ulster’s twelve great distilleries, the better. Illicit distilling also flourishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1927 there were 2,348 persons employed in mining bauxite, chalk, clay, fire clay, flint, gravel, sand, gypsum, granite, igneous rock, limestone, salt and sandstone, and there are 102,446 farms of over an acre producing the national crops: wheat, oats, barley, here, potatoes, turnips, cabbage, flax, fruit and hay. And Irish handmade laces and embroideries are still popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding industry of Northern Ireland, however, as is well known, is the linen industry, which employs about 110,000 persons, not including those engaged in the growing of fiber. There are about a million spindles and 40,000 looms, and the annual value of the linens exported is over $55,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish linen industry, in a commercial sense, began in 1685, when 5,000 Huguenot refugees, mostly hand spinners and weavers of flax, left Picardy and settled in the counties of Antrim and Down, near Belfast. King William VIII employed Louis Crommelin, a prominent Huguenot, to organize these refugees as a linen manufacturing unit, and since his time the whir of spinning wheels and the eliciting of the shuttle have been familiar sounds in almost every Ulster home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course the invention of the power loom (1787) and its introduction into linen manufacture in Northern Ireland (1804) have entirely changed conditions as they were in the days of Crommelin, and today the power loom is responsible for over 90 percent of Irish linen production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless the hand loom still remains in certain districts, used mostly for weaving extra fine table damasks. Within the past few months cloths have been produced showing over 430 threads to the square inch, and Northern Ireland has ever made and probably will make for long to come the finest damasks, cloths and napkins the world has seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free State Industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish Free State is admittedly underdeveloped from the industrial point of view. For the moment the chief interest is agriculture, but the Free State hopes, by a careful protective tariff, to gradually develop more industries and to train operatives. There are now some £250,000,000 of Irish capital invested abroad, much of which could be used at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In bygone years it was hard for Irish industries to make headway, because of legislation so contrived at Westminster as to work against them and for the British industries. At least that is the Irish claim, and the woolen industries are cited as examples. Ireland was at one time malting progress in woolen weaving, but legislation was enacted which stopped it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1860 the sea fisheries of Ireland employed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">13,483 boats and 55,630 hands. Sixty-five years later, in 1Q25, there were only 4,395 boats and 14,589 men and boys employed in this work. Meantime the Free State has lost the principal market, Russia, for Irish herring. Of late there is evidence of a gradual improvement in the fishing industry. The principal sea fisheries are those of herring and mackerel, amounting in 1928 to 46,641,000 pounds, valued at $1,544,000. The annual catch of salmon is about 4,000,000 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good roads have taken the place of the ruined thoroughfares of a few years ago. People are now building where a few years ago they were burning and tearing down. Public improvements are everywhere set in motion. The Ford tractor plant at Cork employs 4,000 workers. All the Ford tractors are made at the Cork plant. These American-Irish-made tractors are imported into the United States duty free. It is declared that in Kerry there is a copper mine which is likely to be one of the finest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though in a sense isolated, being an island beyond an island, Ireland is nevertheless in a favored position with regard to transoceanic travel, whether it be by sea or air, and the time may come -when it will be the terminus of the air trips of the aerial fleets sure to maintain schedules over the vast Atlantic between the Old World and the New.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President Cosgrave, always cheerful, points out that the place occupied by the Irish Free State in the list of Britain’s customers is not sufficiently appreciated by British manufacturers. In the year 1928 the Free State stood fifth in the list of total values of purchases and with the exception of New Zealand the Free State imports per head from Great Britain were the highest of any country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A favorable sign is that there are today at least eight times as many Jews in Ireland as there were twenty years ago. The influx is attributed to the protection granted by the Free State government to the ready-made clothing industry. These Jews have established many flourishing clothing and furniture factories, both of which industries are protected in Southern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Irish Free State men and women marry very late in life, probably due to the excessive caution of the small farmer, who fears to lose the title to his holdings. Between the ages of 25 and 30 the percentage of unmarried men is 80 percent. Between the ages of 35 and 40 it is 50 percent. Between the ages of 55 and 65 it is 26 percent. These figures are unparalleled in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the ease of the women, between the ages of 25 and 30 the percentage of unmarried is 62 percent (as compared with 23 percent in the United States). Between the ages of 30 and 35 the percentage of unmarried women is 42 percent. Though Irish marriages are late, the fertility is high. The families are therefore of the same size as elsewhere, but the parents are older.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The good roads now traversing the country have led to such an increase of motor transportation that the railways have inaugurated their own bus service. The railways are now all in one system, constructed on a gauge of five feet three inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Irish Free State has a new, complete and splendid currency, which has been previously described in our columns. The new Consolidated Bank notes are as interestingly and suggestively designed as the coins. On the front of the one-pound note is a representation of a sturdy-looking farmer with plow and team at work, ■while on the back is a representation of the beautiful custom house at Dublin, set afire during the troublous times, but now restored and occupied by a number of the government departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Free State has 12,163,157 acres under crops and pasture, producing mostly hay, turnips, potatoes, oats, sugar beets, barley and wheat. There are 13,000 places licensed to sell intoxicants in the Free State, .or one to every 230 persons, and the government is taking steps to cut the number in half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Shannon Electrification Scheme</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The River Shannon, largest in the British Isles, rises near Sligo, on the west coast, and after flowing through numerous lakes and cutting off nearly a fourth of Ireland on its way, eventually enters the sea at Limerick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Its watershed, 4,000 square miles, is one-sixth of the area of Ireland. This river, famous in Irish song and dear to Irish hearts, is the scene of Ireland’s greatest industrial development. The whole length of this river is about 250 miles, 130 of which are navigable for large steamers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The River Shannon project is primarily a power-generating scheme, but wisely takes into consideration the question of navigation, flood control, and land drainage. The completion of the partial development alone makes arable 12,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great plant, first provided for in 1925, utilizes Derg Lough, Ree Lough and Allen Lough as reservoirs, with a storage capacity of 827,000,000 meters. The fall is 98 feet. The first installment generates 90,000 horsepower of the 165,000 horsepower contemplated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The area to be supplied with power is over 25,000 square miles. The cost of the first step of the work was in the neighborhood of $15,000,000, and the total will be about $35,000,000. The intake gates, which control the passage of water into the seven-and-a-half-mile-long canal to the power house, were opened with ceremony by President Cosgrave on July 22, 1929. Technically and scientifically the enterprise is a success and will no doubt be such commercially and practically. A special postage stamp has been issued to commemorate the completion of the River Shannon scheme. The design represents the power house at Ardnacrusha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Friends and Neighbors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ireland’s neighbor on the east is Britain, and on the west, America. She cannot escape constant contact with these two countries, which have meant so much to her in the past and will mean so much in the future. England now knows and admits that she made a great mistake in not giving the Irish their freedom generations ago. She had many splendid opportunities to provide the present solution of Irish government, but always took the wrong course, the course of government by force, which could never succeed with a people like the Irish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ireland has fought back through America, with which, the historians now find, she has been connected for at least a thousand years. Indeed, the “Voyages of St. Brendan”, translated into many languages, and known more or less throughout Europe, accredit him with having voyaged to America in the sixth century and exploring the coast from Nova Scotia to Florida. Brendan called this country Ireland the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Spaniards conquered Mexico they were told of a strange people, white, who came to them by sea in corraughs. Now it happens that the Irish name for a large boat is corraugh. It also happens that there are at least four Irish names in Mexico and Central America, which names were here before Columbus ever sailed from Spain. These names are Anahuac, Tulia, Tehuantepec and Nehuedafallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An Icelander, Ari Marson, great grandson of O’Carroll, king of Dublin, sailed from Iceland for Great Ireland and was wrecked on the coast of Florida in 983, and Prof. Bafn, of Copenhagen, states in his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Antiquities</span><span class="font5"> that people speaking the Irish language were found in Florida as far back as the eighth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not surprising to learn that the Irish were in America first, when one stops to consider that Ireland is the nearest European country to North America. Sixty-five years previous to the discovery of Iceland by the Northmen in the ninth century, Irish immigrants had settled on that island, showing that the Irish were used to taking long sea voyages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was from Irish traditions of the discovery of Great Ireland, early current in Scandinavian countries, that Erie the Red and later his son Leif were inspired to explore the Western seas, resulting in Leif’s discovery of Finland, the present New England, about the year 1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a letter preserved by the son of Columbus it seems that that gentleman had visited Iceland, and it is a tradition among the Icelanders that he there came to know of the existence of Great Ireland, which afterward he was privileged to discover anew, and for which discovery he has received most of the glory until recently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">MASSACHUSETTS man caught a twentypound snapping turtle, wrapped it in a coat, and put it in the back seat of his car. Not satisfied with the way he was driving, the turtle worked his way to the front and peevishly bit the Bay State man in the leg. The result was that the car was wrecked, and two others. Many automobilists have thought for some time that this back seat driving by snapping turtles is all wrong, and now we have the proof of it.</span></p>

They are the most primitive people on earth, nomads who know nothing of agriculture, and live on anything they can pick up, from wild honey to snakes. When cut off from their elaborately organized tribal life and employed by the white men they are entirely helpless.”</span></p>

After functioning for eleven years the League has shown that it is powerless to do anything. Instead of decreased expenditures for war the expense account is the other way.

As soon as the fee was paid the garages and filling stations could be placed almost anywhere. An official city veterinary would, of course, know’ better where to place these buildings than anybody else, provided he was given adequate fees.

Just how it will be spent is not known at this time, but nobody doubts that it will be spent. It will get back into circulation, but the scrubwomen will not have the fun of circulating it. Somebody must have blundered wlien the richest country in the world paid its scrubwomen too much.</span></p>

But there is a great and growing market for canned foods, as is evidenced by the fact that the American people now consume about 200,000,000 cases a year. Taking 36 cans to the case, this makes each of us responsible for a little better than a can a week the year round. Practically every human food may now be purchased in cans. The canners are working industriously to perfect their foods and methods of canning, and succeeding very well indeed. They are anticipating, shortly, a serious competition from the development of the frozen foods business. The canning business has practically all grown up in the past twenty-five years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">JACKSONVILLE, Florida, is prosperous today because its municipally owned electric light plant offers electricity cheaper than any other steam-operated plant in the United States. This plant, by the way, showed net earnings of $920,143.08 for the first six months of 1930. Think how many college professors, newspapersandpoliticians that would have kept in comfort and luxury, to say nothing of the rakeoffs for bankers and lawyers, if that plant had been privately owned. Jacksonville also owns her own water department and municipal docks, and in the same period made net earnings on the two of about a third of a million dollars more. You will be told that this is un-American, but Jacksonville is satisfied, and you would be satisfied too, if you lived in Jacksonville. Don’t swallow everything you see and hear about public owmership of public utilities being a bad thing. It is not a bad thing; it is a good thing. The only people that denounce public owmership are the grabbers themselves, who want it all and would for ever have the people under their thumb if they had their way.

<p><span class="font6">The Cause of Hard Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font5">E CLIP a few* paragraphs from an interesting little book on this subject by Paul B. Swanson of San Diego:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are proud of our machinery, but we do not stop to consider that it is our modern machinery that is destroying the economic prosperity of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As modern machinery is taking the place of the wage earner, the consuming power of the nation is diminishing and the producing power is increasing. The prosperity of any nation is dependent on the consuming power of the wage earner, for it is the wage earner who must consume the products of the farm and factory to make the farmer and business man consumers. Our people must always consume food and wear clothing, and the difference between their maximum and minimum consuming power is the difference between prosperity and hard times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The farmer is the victim of our modern machinery and he has felt the effects more keenly than the wage earner. Consider the vast amounts of hay and grain that were consumed by the horse in the cities and towns before the days of the automobile and the auto truck. These products of our farms have been replaced by the products of the oil derrick and the refinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The machine that takes the place of twenty men, such as the new cigar making machine which has recently been put in successful operation by the large manufacturers of nationally used brands, consumes nothing but a small amount of power, but it destroys the consuming power of twenty American families. It also forces out of business, by the reduction in the cost of manufacture, the small manufacturers employing hand labor, and in time means the installation of more machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The modern ditch digging machine does the work of one hundred men. The new billing machine used by large corporations does the work of sixteen persons. Machines now dig the coal in the mines. The concrete mixer used on highways and large buildings takes a truckload to a mouthful. Not only in manufacturing, but in every other line of human endeavor today, machinery is fast supplanting labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the building of automobile frames Mr. Swanson quotes a frame manufacturer, L. R. Smith, as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Think of it! We started out to build 7,200 frames a day with 180 men. (That was our original objective.) We now know that we can build 8,000 frames a day with 120 men. I’d say that was a mighty fine job!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes I share the amazement of a none-the-less sophisticated visitor as we watch a completed frame leave the conveyor-end, brushed and cleansed for the paint line, every ten seconds of the production shift. New drives are being installed which will make the future production at the rate of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one frame every six seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seconds had to be uppermost in our consideration as we sought to answer our question and the way to our final objective. Our thinking had to begin with the frame itself and with every part' of that frame. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">For instance, there are 552 operations required on an ordinary frame as we build it.</span><span class="font4"> Our production goal was 7,200 frames a day—or over 4,000,000 operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning other evidences of the cause of hard times Mr. Swanson continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With every avenue of employment rapidly closing against him, what is the wage earner to do? Heretofore, during dull times when shops were closed or factories cut down production, the advice to the unemployed was: “Go out in the country and get jobs on the farms. ’ ’ This advice may still be good in fruit growing districts, where hand labor has not yet been entirely eliminated, but in a grain growing district it would be useless, for, employing the “Montana Plan,” one man with a three-tractor outfit can grow 800 acres of wheat. With a four-plow tractor and implements sealed up to fit, he can grow 1,100 acres; with a six-plow tractor, 1,800 acres. The hired man on the farm will soon be a memory only. (See the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Country Gentleman</span><span class="font4"> for May, 1929, page 22.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three Televoxes are used by the government now in Washington, I). C., to regulate the flow of water from the reservoirs that supply the capital city. Every half hour the city engineer calls these ‘men’ to ascertain the level of •water in the reservoirs. There is a ‘man’ on each reservoir. Formerly two men worked in 12-hour shifts on each reservoir; or six men in all. Three Televoxes replace the six men, reducing the expense about $900 a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cigar making machine is also a mechanical man, a super-cigar maker; the linotype and automatic presses, the super-printer; the steam shovel and ditch digger, the super-workman; the auto truck, the superhorse. The mechanical clerk is replacing the clerk. In the past our vending machines were confined to gum, but now the field has been enlarged to such articles as pie, sandwiches, sodas, cigarettes, and many others. In the stores, mills, mines, factories, in fact in every walk of life where wage earners are employed, mechanical men are taking their place; the producer is taking the place of the producer-consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So swiftly have we progressed mechanically since the war that the people generally do not realize it, nor do they realize that these changed conditions are the direct cause of the present economic depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Island of Dogs </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Ruth Farrer</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE island of Juan de Nova is approximately midway between Madagascar and Mozambique. It is one of the most amazing islands of the seven seas because no other is so queerly populated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the time when steam altered the sea routes, vessels in the Indian and Asiatic trade occasionally touched at Juan de Nova for fresh water, fruit, and turtles. Behind them they often left dogs of different breeds. As the environment was suitable and food was abundant, they soon increased to thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They, are descended from all sorts of European breeds, bulldog, bull terrier, Pomeranian, spaniel, mastiff, hound. The animals are of all crosses or interbreeds and colors, except, odd though it may seem, pure white and also brindled. Some of them drop their tails, like the wolf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dogs hunt in packs, and each pack keeps within, its own bounds. With singular aptitude they detect the hidden turtles’ eggs along the sandy beaches and on the reefs. These dogs stalk with all the cunning that the fox shows in gaining a young turtle or an egg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They hate human creatures, and packs combine against visitors. Some years ago a French: vessel, running short of water, stopped off Juan de Nova and sent a boat ashore. So fierce were the packs that the men could not land, and another bosh’s crew had to convoy them to the nearby spring, keeping up a sharp fusillade both going and coming, or the party would have been torn to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dogs wage war on man in silent ruthlessness, for these canine hordes are now dumb dogs literally. They have lost their bark. Along the lonely moonlit beaches their voices resound, only in long, unearthly quaverings. Such is the “Island of Dogs”, or Juan de Nova.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one time, when the island of Juan Fernandez was overrun with goats, the Spaniards turned loose there several cargoes of dogs. In time the dogs thinned out the goats, being forced to hunt through hunger. This island, too, was rapidly becoming a dogdom. A virulent attack of mange cleared this island of its hordes of dogs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Removing Disease with Diet</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the late Prof. Virchow, of Berlin, said, “The future is with the vegetarians,” he knew’ by experience that he was stating a truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the late Avorld Avar Denmark faced a condition of starvation. Denmark was not in the Avar, but the country was too small to groAV food for its 3,000,000 people, Avho depended on importations from other countries for a large portion of Avhat they ate. These importations Avere stopped by the blockade in March, 1917, and by October of that year the food shortage produced a grave situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. M. Hindhede Avas director of the Danish State Laboratory for Nutritional Research, at Copenhagen. He had long been known as one of the Avorld’s leading nutritional experts. The war strategy board of Denmark appointed him to take charge of the food problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hindhede held that man did not need meat, milk, eggs, cheese, fish, and butter. He contended that man is a vegetarian; that his diet consists of plant products, as does that today of the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang-outang, and gibbon, man’s nearest resemblances in the animal Avorld. He reached this conclusion as the result of his extensive ’work in diet. Now he had an opportunity to test the case on a nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Hindhede took charge of the situation, much of the food in Denmark consisted of cereals and. tubers that were stored for the live stock. There Avas not enough for both man and beast; so he ordered that the live stock be disposed of, and the order Avas executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For tAvelve months, from October, 1917, the people of Denmark subsisted on a strict vegetarian diet, consisting of Avhole grains, potatoes, leafy vegetables, and fruits. What Avas the result ? It is not told by the medical Avorld in long articles in the daily press. Why? Yes, Avhy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these tvcelve months, the death rate dropped from more than 100 per thousand to 66 per thousand. Intestinal disorders disappeared. Disorders of the vital organs, such as liver, kidneys, and heart, greatly declined. The general health of the nation was the best in its history; the death rate was the lowest ever recorded in any civilized country. Statistics proved these facts. Why does the medical world keep these facts hidden from the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of this nation-Avide experiment shoAved the intimate relation existing between diet and disease. It shoAved what should be omit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. G. R. Clements (OUahorna)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ted from man’s diet; it showed the deadly effect of his eating meat, milk, eggs, cheese, fish, and butter. It shoAved that there is no such thing-as “fat and protein minimum”. It showed that man can obtain from fruits and vegetables all the protein and fat that his body needs. Why not? Where do cows, deer, elephants, and horses get their fat and protein?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the World War there has been a noticeable trend in this country away from flesh food. In fact, the consumption of flesh has steadily declined for the last thirty years, and the decline quickened right after the Avar. The flesh packers have felt the effect of it, and put on their intensive campaign to persuade people to “eat more meat”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is one other vital point in the - story that the reader must not miss. He is told by medical institutions, in their cleverly prepared propaganda, that the medical world is engaged in the work of trying to stamp out disease and improve human health. To put the tale before the people more effectively, the great press of the land freely opens its pages to the pens of medical doctors. But not one Avord appears regarding the marvelous results of the nationwide food experiment of Hindhede in Denmark. Why? Yes, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Staggering sums of money are donated by the wealthy to establish and maintain medical institutions, and to conduct research, in the hope that means Avill be discovered of improving human health and of lengthening the life-span. But not one dollar of this money is used to carry on the Avork of food-experimentation, as conducted by Hindhede. Why? Yes, why?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Scan the pages of the big dailies, dear reader. Notice in particular the many patent medicine advertisements. Think of the vast sum of money these advertisements bring the owners of the papers. If people knew that faulty food builds disease, and that proper food builds health, what would become of the patent medicine makers? They Avould be throvm into bankruptcy, and the newspapers would lose the vast revenue now derived from the advertising received from patent medicine makers. Does this answer your question of Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Contemplate the huge sums expended annually by deceived people for medical advice, medical attention, and for medicine. The medical trust and the drug trust would lose this vast sum if people knew that faulty food builds disease and that proper food builds health. Does this ansiver your question of Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Contemplate the huge sums invested in drug and serum plants. Contemplate the huge sums derived from the sale of these products. These plants would be thrown into bankruptcy in less than six months if people knew that faulty food builds disease and that proper food builds health. Does this answer your question of Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. Contemplate the barrels of filthy, diseasebuilding serums and substances that are injected into the blood-stream of adults and children, under the false pretense that this superstitious practice will protect people from demon disease. This would be stopped, and medical doctors would lose yearly hundreds of thousands of dollars, if people knew that faulty food builds disease and that proper food builds health. Does this answer your question of Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Contemplate the large sums donated annually by deceived people during the Christmas Seals campaigns, conducted yearly to raise money to be used to “combat tuberculosis”. Who gets this money? Who uses this money? Who profits from these campaigns? “The medical trust,” is the answer. The medical trust would lose this vast sum if people knew that faulty food builds disease and that proper food builds health. Does this answer your question of Why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">You have another Why to ask. You ask: Why does the government not take a hand in the game, and help the people to learn the truth? You forget that the branch of our government, both state and national, which controls and directs these matters is the Public Health departments, and that these are manned lay medical doctors, who, in every instance, receive their political appointments, offices, and jobs upon the recommendation of the American Medical Association, and who must live true to the machine that controls their service and destiny, or else be damned and degraded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In conclusion, we urge that the reader conduct a little investigation into these matters. He will be shocked by his findings. He will learn that medical institutions are one of the most deadly and deceiving menaces that ever waxed fat and grew great on the blood of deceived man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Too JMany Chemicals (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font5">E ARE all happy to fie living in what may be called the chemical era. We owe more to the chemists than we can begin to imagine, because they are now touching life at every point, from the cradle to the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without moving from the spot, we see the hand of the chemist in the dyes used in this typewriter ribbon, the ink in the fountain pen, the paper on which we write, the rubber eraser, the various colored leads in the pencils, the glass in the paper weight, the paints and shellacs on table and machine, and liquid paste, so superior to the mucilages of a bygone era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we shift our position and look farther afield we see the hand of the chemist everywhere. If it were not for him there would be no gasoline with which to get about and nothing much to see after we got there, at least as far as the works of man are concerned; and yet somehow we feel that there is a limit to the chemicals which should go down our necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is all right for the automobiles. It may even be necessary, or thought necessary, for poison gas or for formaldehyde wherewith the funeral director assists us to a. graceful exit from this mundane sphere, but we do not want too much of it in our drinking water. Or at least we think we don't; and if we think we don’t, then we don’t. That is the way we mortals are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The occasion for this is the following item taken from the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Swi-Tele.graph.</span><span class="font5"> It seems that some of the citizens of western Pennsylvania feel uneasy about taking into their stomachs water which is so heavily laden with chemicals that it will eat holes in a linen cloth.

<div>
<p><span class="font5">HpHE people suffer much in this life and they desire to know what the future holds for them. They have the right to know the real cause of their suffering and what is the basis for a hope of better things in the future. The time has come when the people desire the truth; and the truth is found only in the Bible, because it is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let it be clearly understood that I have no fight with any clergyman as a man; but that I am positively and uncompromisingly against what they teach, because they do not teach the truth. It is the privilege of any man to believe what he wants to, but when he holds himself out before the people as a teacher of the Bible and misrepresents God and His Word, then it becomes necessary to speak that which the Bible really contains. The people need the truth, and they want it regardless of any man or class of men, and no one should permit personalities to interfere with gaining a knowledge of the truth. Let all prejudice be laid aside and the study approached with an unbiased mind; then good will result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a sample of what modern clergymen teach I quote the language of two, as follows: (1) The bishop of Birmingham says: “Stories of Adam and Eve, their primal innocence and their fall, have become mere folklore. Darwin’s evolution lias destroyed the whole theological scheme.” (2) Doctor McAfee, another distinguished clergyman, says: “The god of evolution is a more potent factor in life than the God of the Bible.” I submit that these men should no longer deceive the people by posing as and claiming to be ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great fundamental truths, upon which rests the hope of the human race, are these: That God created, man perfect; that by reason of disobedience to God’s law man lost his life and the right thereto, and that God made provision through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the redemption and restoration of man. If these truths are discredited there is absolutely nothing upon which to base a hope for the human race. Their vital importance at once appears, and hence the necessity for speaking plainly. The modernist clergymen would destroy these great fundamental truths entirely, I appeal to the people to stand by the Bible and hold to the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">sure foundation of God’s Word for their hope of eternal life and endless blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus declares that the Bible is the truth. With safety the people can believe and rely upon the words of Jesus. It is not safe to believe a clergyman who disputes God’s Word. The Bible says God made man perfect and that by reason of sin he lost life and the right thereto, and that God through Jesus Christ has made provision for man’s redemption and deliverance. This great doctrine of redemption God foretold by His holy prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that God created the perfect man and woman and gave them the power to multiply and fill the earth is at least presumptive proof that Jehovah purposed that in some future day that perfect pair should be surrounded by a multitude of perfect children, all dwelling-together upon the earth in happiness and giving glory to the great Almighty Creator. Doubtless He had revealed His purpose to the Logos and Lucifer at the time of the laying of the foundation of the world. (Job 38:7) The rebellious Lucifer attempted to spoil the purpose of Jehovah and to obtain the service and worship of man for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Necessarily the issue at once arose, to wit, Would Jehovah maintain His good name and make good His word, or’would lie be compelled to destroy His creature for ever and thereby admit that His purpose in the creation of the earth and man upon it had failed? Satan would reason like this: If God does carry out the announced penalty of His law by causing Adam, to die, that will be an admission that God cannot make a man. who will maintain his integrity and his allegiance to Jehovah, and will therefore prove that God’s efforts at creation have failed. If God does not kill Adam according to the announced penalty of His law, then God proves Himself a liar and no one of His creatures will have confidence in God. In either event God’s creatures, lacking confidence in Him, will turn away from Him, and I shall receive the worship of man and probably other creatures [which Satan so much coveted].’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was Satan’s desire and probably his belief that God would not kill Adam; hence he boldly concocted and told the first lie: “Ye shall not surely die.” He not only made God out a liar,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">but challenged God to carry out the penalty of His law, reasoning that by so doing God would prove His own iveakness. Therefore the rebellion of Lucifer and the fall of man at once involved the word and name of the great Creator. AVhat would God do in vindication thereof?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God did pronounce the sentence of death on man, but did not carry it into immediate execution. He expelled Adam from Eden and turned His face away from man. If those conditions should continue forever, with man completely alienated from God, and man should continue to live, man would therein suffer mental torment. Probably the doctrine of eternal torment originated at that time with Satan, and from the time that Adam was expelled from the presence of God till now Satan has kept that defamatory doctrine alive. If God should have compassion upon Adam and set aside His judgment and ignore it thereafter, what would be the effect on His creatures? Man would conclude that he could sin again and continue to violate God’s law with impunity. The angels of heaven would also conclude that they could do likewise. The fact that God did not put Adam to death immediately was doubtless used by Satan to turn many of the angels of heaven away from Jehovah and to cause them to follow Satan. Satan would therefore prove to himself, and have some tangible evidence for others, that God’s not having put man to death made God a liar and destroyed the reason for confidence of His creatures in Him. Doubtless this vras the reason why many of the angels turned array from Jehovah and followed after Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men have insisted that God should have forgiven Adam and extended mercy toward him and not enforced the penalty of His law. In support of their conclusion they cite the words of Jesus when addressing Peter. Peter asked Jesus how often he should forgive his brother if he sinned against him. Jesus answered: “Until seventy times seven.” (Matt. 18:21,22) Those who use this as an argument in support of the contention that God should have forgiven Adam do not recognize that the relationship between two men who are brothers is very different from that of God toward His perfect creature. The creature Adam was perfect and deliberately violated his Maker’s law. The words of Jesus related to brothers, both of whom are imperfect and therefore sinners, and who should have due consideration for the weaknesses of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam was a perfect man; and his obligation was to obey God’s law. The statement of that law was plain and explicit. (Gen. 2:16,17) There was at least an implied covenant on the part of Adam to keep that law, and he was able to do so; therefore the question of repentance and forgiveness could not be taken into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the very day of the expulsion of Adam from Eden God began to utter prophecy relating to the restitution of man. While God knew the end from the beginning, Satan was not wise enough to know that. In pronouncing the judgment Jehovah foretold of “the seed” that would come in some future day, but not from Adam, which “seed” should be the complete conqueror of Satan and should destroy death and its power. No one was wise enough to know when and how the “seed” and conqueror would come. God made the statement of the fact, and that is all-sufficient.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Covering</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God prepared the skins of animals, and with these made a covering for Adam and Eve. That was a prophetic act. Necessarily one or more animals must die in order to provide such covering of skins. The covering was provided because of sin. Thus God prophetically indicated that the sin of man could be covered and hid from His sight, but only by and through the death of another. The death of the one furnishing a cover must be a substitute for Adam’s life. That prophetic act of Jehovah pointed to the further fact that He would provide a substitute for man to redeem man; that the Redeemer must become such at a great cost; and that He must be strong and overcome the enemy. From time to time God continued to put things before man which pointed to the future Redeemer. It remained for the latter day, when men are provided with the Bible and have the spirit of the Lord, for them to understand these things by the grace of God. Now, thanks be unto God, the time has come for man to understand and appreciate to at least some degree God’s wisdom, love and porver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gave respect to the sacrifice of animals. The offering of animals as sacrifices prophetically pointed to what God would require for the release of man from bondage. Abel and Cain each brought an offering for sacrifice unto the Lord. The sacrifice of Abel was the firstling of his flock, and God had respect to that sacrifice. The act of giving respect to that sacrifice by Jehovah must have prophetically pointed to what would be required for man’s release from bondage, because 2500 years thereafter God commanded the Israelites to make a similar sacrifice. (Gen. 4:4; Num. 18:17) The sacrifice of Cain was not acceptable unto the Lord. The reason is now apparent to the careful student, to wit, that Cain’s sacrifice was only the fruit of the ground and did not require the giving up of life; rvhereas the sacrifice that Abel brought required the shedding of blood. “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” (Heb. 11: 4) This does not mean that God took pleasure in the slaying of animals. It does mean that it prophetically pointed forward to the time when God would accept a life as a substitute for that which Adam had forfeited, and that such life would be the price of redemption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no Scriptural evidence that men in early times had any knowledge of the real purpose of sacrifice, but faithful men learned that the sacrifice of life had respect by Jehovah and that this had something to do with man’s future blessing. Their faith in God was pleasing to Him. By receiving such sacrifice the Lord was making prophecy. Jehovah had no real pleasure or satisfaction in the sacrifice of animals, but such was His method of prophesying concerning His purpose of providing redemption for man. In His due time He would reveal to the faithful ones the meaning thereof, and thereby their faith and confidence in Him would be made strong. (Heb. 10:6) That men had such faith in Jehovah God is proven by what followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Noah came out of the ark he slew animals and offered them in sacrifice unto God, and the Lord had respect to such sacrifice. (Gen. 8:20) That time was far removed from the time of Eden, but undoubtedly the sacrifice offered by Noah was a remembrance of sin and of the necessity for a substitute for the sinners; hence the sacrifice was a prophetic act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham was justified by faith and he manifested his faith in God by offering up animals in sacrifice. This he did as soon as he reached the land of Canaan. (Gen. 12: 7) It is not to be understood that Abraham knew God’s purpose of redemption, but he had faith in God that whatever God did was right; and God directed Abraham’s action, and his sacrifice of animals unto God was a silent prophecy pointing to something better in the future. Then God subsequently directed Abraham in making a sacrifice that spoke with prophetic eloquence of the great sacrifice to be made in the future for man’s redemption. God commanded Abraham to take his only son Isaac, whom he loved, and offer him for a burnt offering. (Gen. 22:1-18) Abraham proceeded to do as he was commanded; and when he had gone to the very point of slaying his only beloved son, Ged stayed his hand. Immediately Jehovah provided an animal for sacrifice in the place of Isaac. By the acts there performed a great prophecy had been uttered with just as much force as if the son had been actually killed. Here was not only a prophecy of what God would require as the price for man’s redemption, but an interpretation of the meaning of the sacrifice of animals. It showed that the sacrifice of animals was merely a prophetic picture saying in substance that in some future day there must be a sacrifice of life that will furnish the great cost price for the redemption of man, and that that life must be a substitute for Adam and therefore a perfect life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that prophetic picture Abraham represented God, while Isaac, Abraham’s only son, represented God’s only beloved Son Christ Jesus. Offering up his only son was a great cost to Abraham and prophetically said: ‘Jehovah God is the Redeemer of man by reason of the fact that He makes provision for redemption, and that provision is made with great cost to Jehovah.’ There was nothing in what Abraham did in connection with the sacrifice to interpret the prophetic picture. But today the student of the Scriptures can well see that God did thereby foretell how the Redeemer would be found and provided, and that in order to be the redeemer of man such Redeemer must die sacrificially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God was about to deliver His people from the bondage of Egypt, which bondage represented the bondage of mankind to their oppressor, the enemy Satan, He caused the Israelites to offer a male lamb without blemish. Its blood was sprinkled over the doorpost of each residence, and where that blood was sprinkled the first-born were protected from death. The Passover lamb was sacrificed, and then Moses, as the active deliverer, led the Israelites out of bondage. (Ex. 12:1-51) Primarily the slain lamb stood for Moses, who could not die and still lead the Israelites out; and therefore the lamb prophetically foretold the Greater than Moses and the One whom Moses represented, and that He should die as a sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God gave the Israelites His law at Mount Sinai He provided for the tabernacle and prescribed the ceremonies to be performed in the use thereof. (Ex. 25:1-40) The tenth day of the seventh month of each year was the one day of the year on which the Israelites were to afflict themselves because of their shortcomings and transgressions. That was their annual atonement day. On that day animals must be slain and the priest must take the blood of those animals and carry it into the Most Holy of the tabernacle and sprinkle the blood upon the mercy seat. First the blood of the bullock, and then the blood of the Lord’s goat, was thus sprinkled. That ceremony made atonement for the sins of the people for the year. Doubtless that is all the Jews could see about what was done. They could not understand the real meaning of these sacrifices. There again, however, a great prophecy was uttered. That prophecy sliow’ed that one must be found to be offered up as a sacrifice for mankind, and hove atonement should be accomplished. The court that surrounded the tabernacle was the place where the animals were slain, and represented the earth where the great sacrifice must be made. The Most Holy represented heaven itself, and there the blood must be sprinkled; saying in effect that the great redemptive price for the release of man must be paid in heaven and that that price must be a life poured out in sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah caused His chosen people by their very course of action to utter prophecy relating to the future. He showed that the Redeemer must also be the Deliverer. Egypt was holding the Israelites in restraint, with Pharaoh as the ruler thereof representing Satan and his organized power holding mankind in restraint. Moses, strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, delivered the Israelites, thereby uttering a prophecy which, said: ‘The day will come when the Greater than Moses shall arise who will redeem and deliver the human race from the bondage of the enemy.’ Likewise David, in rescuing the Israelites from the enemies, representatively prophesied that God would send a Mighty One who would rescue the people and deliver them from their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then God caused men wdio were really devoted to Him to speak words of prophecy concerning the Redeemer. It is not to be expected that those men would understand the meaning of the words they uttered concerning the Redeemer, but they spoke or wrote as the power of God moved them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his great suffering and tribulation Job represented, among other things, humankind suffering and desiring to be delivered. Job first speaks of the goodness of God and the insignificance of man, and how impossible it is for imperfect man to bring himself into harmony with his Creator. Then ho adds: “There is no umpire [mediator] betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both.” (Job 9: 33, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.,</span><span class="font5"> margin) This prophecy said in substance: 'There must be one to go between God and man, which mediator God will provide for the deliverance of man.’ Then. Job gave utterance to these prophetic v/ords: “But I know that my redeemer liveth, and as the Last over my dust will he arise; and though after my skin is struck off this followeth, yet apart from my flesh shall I see God.”—Job 19: 25, 26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah caused His prophet to utter these words (Hos. 13:14): “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.” The word “redeem” in this text means to buy back with a price, and the word “ransom” employedin the same text means to rescue, make free and deliver. The prophecies therefore mean that some day in His appointed way God would buy back the right of man to life, and buy this right with a price, and would rescue, deliver and set men free from the power of death and the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Relating to the same matter God caused His prophet to write: “They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any moans redeem [deliver and make free] his brother, nor give to God a ransom [provide the covering or redemptive price] for him: . . . that he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.” (Ps. 49: 6-9) Regardless of all the riches a man might possess, he could not provide the price required to make himself or his brother or the human family free. God must make the provision. Then the prophecy is uttered that God will do that very thing for man. (Ps. 49:14,15) “Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. But Goel will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gradually God, by words and the actions taken by His people under His direction, disclosed His purpose to provide redemption by the sacrifice of a life as a substitute for Adam. Then through His prophets He tells more specifically of His purposes. He foretells the coming of a man entirely pure and free from sin; that he would be offered as a sacrifice and would willingly submit to death; that he would pour out his being in death and in his death would provide the great cost price that would redeem man from death and the grave; that the perfect man would die as though he were a sinner, yet being without sin, and his life would be made an offering for sin; that God would raise him up again, that Jehovah’s purpose would prosper in his hand and that he should not only be the Redeemer of man by his own life-blood, but be a great Conqueror and triumph over the enemy. Among other things in this wonderful prophecy He uses these words: &quot;Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he open-eth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall rny righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.” —Isa. 53:4-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Test</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How shall we know that these prophecies are true? The answer is, Because they completely meet the divinely-provided test. Every prophet that spoke the truth spoke in the name of Jehovah; therefore the prophecy is Jehovah’s Word. Jehovah provided the test by which the people might know the truth or falsity of such prophecy. All the prophecy herein set forth exactly complies with those requirements; namely, all were spoken in the name of Jehovah, all tend to turn the people to Jehovah and teach them that He is the Almighty God, and many of the prophecies have been fulfilled or are in course of fulfilment, thereby proving that the prophets who spoke were God’s prophets and spoke His Word of truth. If some of the prophecies thus spoken have already been fulfilled, then with absolute confidence we may expect the other portions of the prophecy to be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fulfilment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was born exactly at the place foretold by God’s prophet. (Mic. 5:2) lie was begotten, not by man, but by the power of Jehovah God, and was therefore pure and without defilement. (Matt. 1:18; Heb. 7:26) He was brought into the world to speak, and did speak, in the name of Jehovah God. (John 6:38,57) He was born a Jew under the law, and was therefore raised up from among His brethren, even as Moses had prophesied. (Deut. 18:15,18; Gal. 4:4) When Ho appeared to begin His work on earth as a man, John the Baptist, one of the greatest of the prophets, pointing toward Jesus said: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God [Jesus, foretold as the sacrificial or Paschal Lamb], which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29) Jesus had come to be offered up as a sacrifice even as the lamb was offered by the Israelites, and the life of Jesus would be poured out for the sin of the world. The prophet of Jehovah had foretold that He would come ‘to comfort those that mourn’. (Isa. 61:1, 2) Jesus went about doing good and comforting those who did mourn, healing the sick and opening the eyes of the blind. (Luke 4:18; Matt. 11:28) All mankind was in bondage to death and in need of life, and Jesus said: “I am come that they might have life.” (John 10:10) He further said that He came to give His life a ransom, the purchase price, for man.—Matt. 20:28; John 6: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was persecuted and oppressed; He was assaulted and wrongfully charged with crime; He vras tried and convicted as though He were a wicked person, and was crucified between two thieves, all of which had been foretold of and concerning Him by God’s prophet. He was raised from death by the power of Jehovah. (Acts 10:38-40) He was raised, and ascended into heaven, the great Conqueror over death, and is alive for evermore, and still leads on, the Conqueror over all opposition. (Rev. 1:18; 6:2) As to why His life-blood was poured out in death God’s inspired witness testified, to wit: “IVe see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” —Heb. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” (1 Tim. 2:5,6) “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot; who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.”—1 Pet. 1:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a climax of this argument I quote John 3:16, to wit: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” There is no other means of salvation for man. God made this provision because of His unselfishness. His provision is complete. Let the people choose as to whether they will accept the unsupported statement of modern clergymen or wall rely upon the inspired Word of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">They were purchased, innocently, and the best remedy for the error of buying them, is their prompt destruction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Ladies and gentlemen, right this way. You now see before you the grand high he religious Mogul of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the islands of the sea, duly qualified to tell everybody what to read, and also w’hat not to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ladies and gentlemen, the books of the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION “are not Scriptural”. (?) We do not know why they are not, but they “are not”! They are packed so full of the Bible from end to end that it seems just like reading the Bible itself, yet the “Pahstah” says they are not Scriptural. He must know, for that is what he is paid to know, and all he is paid to know. If he knows it, that is what he knows and nothing else but, and if he doesn’t know it (and he doesn’t), then he doesn’t know it and nothing else but. A glance at the Scriptures cited in Judge Rutherford’s books and the comments thereon, especially in the chapter in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> on “Hypocrisy Exposed”, will show why the “'Pahstah” wishes these books unread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These books say “there is no hell”. (?) Here is a fine chance to earn some money. Send us in one of the books marked to prove that it says there is no hell, and get a check for $100 right back in the next mail,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They say the soul is annihilated, or sleeps, after death.” (?) Well, which will you have, Pahstah? You can’t have both. If a thing is asleep it is not annihilated, is it? The Scriptures show that the dead are asleep. But some of them will be annihilated, Pahstah. Maybe you will be one of them. So you score both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They say Christ’s coming has ‘all ready’ occurred.” Righto 1 But, Pahstah, when you use the word ‘already’, it should not be split up into two words. If all are ready for a thing, then it might be said that they are “all ready”. But if a thing has already come to pass, it is not necessarily of such a nature that all are ready to see it. Apparently you are not ready for the great truth you have brushed lightly aside. But some of us are all ready, already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They are confusing.” (?) Certainly I. Nothing has ever so confused the Devil and his crowd as these books. That is part of their mission. Such as go to make up the Devil’s crowd have no faith in God or His Word, and. therefore when they read the literature of the Bible Students they read with a film over their eyes and do not know what it is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They are neither scientific nor Scriptural on the creation.” (?) All right! We waited a lifetime for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font5"> to tell us what is scientific and what is Scriptural. Go to it, Pahstah. The world wiggles its ears to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They were purchased innocently.” (?) Oh! Were they? Well, you know you were not one of the innocent ones. You would know better. Catch you buying books to help you understand the Bible! Not much! It is all you can do to keep read up on the ever-shifting foolishness of Evolution, without trying to keep abreast of the unfoldings of what you esteem Jewish folklore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, Pahstah, we know you want the books destroyed, and also the man who wrote them, and the men and women who take them around from door to door. They bring so many questions from the flock that it disturbs you in your slumbers. But we have to give you credit for barking this time, even if you did bark up the wrong tree.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A commentary on the last book of the Bible, The Revelation, showing that its extraordinary mysterious descriptions picture events that the readers have seen with their own eyes, and others about to take place very soon, and that the destiny to which they are leading is the end of Satan’s dominion over the earth, and the establishment of Christ’s kingdom among men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">An unusual book setting forth the many assurances iof the Bible that it is God’s purpose to give everlasting life to mankind. It links the return of the Jews to Palestine with the approaching reconstruction of the world upon the foundation of righteousness. It also takes up the subject of the evil in the world and gives a simple, in fact the only reasonable explanation of why God has not hindered evil, pointing to the time, not far distant, when evil shall be for ever abolished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Points out some of the striking prophetic references to the hypocritical conditions existing in the so-called “Christian” world today.

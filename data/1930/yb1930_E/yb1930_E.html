<p><span class="font13">YEAR BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is but one true and almighty God. Jehovah is his name. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and he alone is the Giver of life everlasting. All his works are perfect, and done according to his will. With him everything is in order and done orderly. His organization is composed of those who are in complete harmony with him. The greater portion of his organization is invisible to man. He has made Christ his chief officer and elect servant, and clothed him with full power and authority to act. The title “Christ” means God’s anointed, and is Scripturally applied to Christ Jesus and to the members of his body. Men and women on the earth who are anointed of God in Christ and who are devoted to God are members of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Opposed to Jehovah is the god of this evil world. Satan is his name, which name means adversary. He is also Scripturally known as Serpent, meaning deceiver; Devil, meaning slanderer; and Dragon, meaning devourer. The plan of Satan is to turn all creatures against the Creator. For this reason he opposes God and reproaches his good name. He deceives many by blinding them to the truth and prevents them from knowing Jehovah. He maliciously slanders Jehovah’s name and charges him with wrong-doing. He endeavors to devour or destroy all who devote themselves wholly to Jehovah. Satan has built up a mighty organization, which is composed of himself, his horde of wicked angels, and many representatives amongst men.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font7">The Bible is an expression of Jehovah’s purposes. It is the Word of God, and is the truth. It is the s means employed to disclose to man Jehovah’s purpose and method of giving life everlasting to man. The Bible makes mention of “the last days”, meaning the concluding days of Satan’s organization. It discloses Jehovah’s purpose to destroy Satan and his organization, and to release mankind from oppression and give to all an unhindered opportunity to learn the truth and to receive everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A society is properly defined as a company of men and women united together and working harmoniously to accomplish a defined purpose. The term “the Society” as used herein is intended to mean and means a body of men and women associated harmoniously together, who are anointed by and wholly devoted to Jehovah, and who confess and acknowledge Christ Jesus as their Redeemer, Lord and Master. Of necessity they are in harmony with one another, being in Christ, and are anointed of God and could not be divided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1884 a few men and women united themselves by forming a corporation under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania and thereby formed a society, which corporate body is known as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The purpose of that Society, as expressed in its charter, is to instruct men and women in, and to aid them to understand, the Bible. As a corporation it holds title to certain properties, and is the acknowledged and recognized instrument of those devoted to the Lord to carry on the legitimate work of God’s anointed people on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Afterward the Peoples Pulpit Association was formed and organized under the laws of the State of New York as a means of aiding and assisting the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in carrying on the work of representing the Lord’s interests on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Peoples Pulpit Association holds title to certain property rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the same purpose and to the same end, the International Bible Students Association was formed and organized under the laws of England. This corporation also holds title to certain property interests. It is an instrument used in conjunction with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to carry on the work of the Lord’s anointed on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All three of these corporations are working jointly and harmoniously together. They are not business concerns as that term is legally applied, but are instruments employed by Jehovah and his people to carry on his work on earth in an orderly manner. None of these corporations ever solicits money. They make no attempt whatsoever to obtain members. None of these corporations has a membership roll. The charter of each of said corporations provides the manner by which one may become a member of and have a vote in the corporation or corporations. Generally, the boards of directors and the officers of said corporations are the same. These are non-stock corporations, and no officer or servant thereof receives a salary or other pecuniary profit. They are created solely to meet the legal requirements to hold property, and to carry on the work in which they are engaged. The primary purpose of these organizations is to aid the people to obtain a better understanding of God’s purposes as set forth in his Word, that they may understand his means provided for bringing them blessings of life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These corporations are charitable organizations within the meaning of that term. They put forth an unselfish effort to aid others, without desire for or hope of pecuniary profit. These corporations are benevolent, in that they seek to benefit the mind of the individual and to aid mankind in a higher and better course of living. These corporations are of public benefit, in that they enable creatures to see their obligations to the Creator, and their proper relationship to their fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A preacher, within the Scriptural definition of that term, is one who tells good news to others. All anointed of the Lord are preachers or ministers of the truth. Their authority is set forth by the Scriptures, from which the following is quoted: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”—Isa. 61:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The methods employed by the Society which uses the above corporations for the preaching of the gospel are these, to wit: by holding public meetings at which one or more persons deliver a public address; by the use of the radio for the broadcasting of the gospel of the kingdom of God; by the publication of books, magazines, and other literature containing an explanation of God’s Word and his purpose, and by those engaged as members of said Society in the work thereof going from house to house and calling upon the people in their homes, telling them about the Lord’s kingdom, and exhibiting to them the gospel message of God’s kingdom as printed in the books, magazines, and other publications, and thereby affording the public the opportunity to understand the truth concerning God’s Word. No one of the Society employs the preaching of the gospel for pecuniary profit. The books and other literature carried from door to door are </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">exhi</span><span class="font7">bited to the people and a nominal sum of money is taken therefor, provided the person wants any of the same, and this money is used for the purpose of furthering the instruction of the people concerning God’s Word. Those who engage in this work do so unselfishly and in the interests of mankind, understanding it to be their great privilege thus to tell the people of God’s Word and of his purpose to bless them with the opportunity for life, liberty, and happiness. With those who engage in the work, every day is the same. They believe and hold that a good deed should be done on Sunday and on each and every other day. In thus preaching the gospel they are proceeding under the authority given to them by the Lord through the Scriptures, and which right is conceded by every civilized nation on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are thus devoted to the Lord are otherwise spoken of as “Bible Students”, and at other times as the International Bible Students Association. Such terms are general and apply to all those who are consecrated to the Lord, who are anointed, and who are therefore devoted to God and the proclamation of his message. Throughout the earth there are organized bodies of men and women called “Bible classes” or “ecclesias”. These assemble regularly for the study of the Bible, and use as aids thereto the publications prepared and published by the above-named corporations. These various organizations or classes accept and recognize the corporations above mentioned as means or instruments for the accomplishment of the work of proclaiming God’s kingdom on earth. The official paper published and supported by such Society is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font7"> It is published twice each month, at Brooklyn, New York, and is devoted entirely to matters pertaining to the Bible. Its chief purpose is to serve as a means of instruction to those who are studying the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The three corporations above named do not constitute “the Society” as that term is herein used. “The Society” as hereinbefore defined means all of God’s anointed people on earth who are harmoniously engaged together as his witnesses to give testimony to his name and to his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who compose “the Society”, well knowing that Satan and his organization is the adversary of God, expect that Satan and his instruments will oppose them in their work. While being in the world, those of the Society do not form a part of the world; and Satan therefore blinds others to the truth and induces them to oppose and persecute each and every one who is faithful unto Jehovah.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TEACHINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Neither the Society nor any of the aforementioned corporations has what is generally understood to be a formal creed. Understanding “creed” to mean that which one believes, they believe that which is set forth in the Bible, and which expresses God’s purposes concerning the human race. In order to be understood there is set forth herein an epitome of the truths briefly summed up as these followers of Christ believe the Bible to teach, to wit;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>BIBLE DOCTRINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">That the great Creator of heaven and earth is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God, </span><span class="font7">and that he has revealed himself in his Word by that name; that he also reveals himself by his name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font7"> which means his purpose concerning his creatures ; and as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font7"> meaning that his power is without limitation; and as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Most High,</span><span class="font7"> meaning that he is above all.—Isa. 42: 5, 8; Ps. 91:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the beginning of his creation was the Logos. (John 1:1; Col. 1:15; Prov. 8:22-29) That thereafter God created all things by Jesus Christ as his active agent. (Eph. 3:9) That among his creatures was Lucifer, who together with the Logos constituted the “morning stars’’ that sang together at the laying of the foundation of the earth.—Job 38: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That God created the earth as a habitation for perfect man, and that the earth shall abide for ever.— Isa. 45:12,18; Eccl. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the Bible is God’s Word, given for the purpose of instructing man in the right way; that, God having expressed his purpose in his Word, that purpose must be accomplished and there is no deviation therefrom. —Isa. 46: 9-11; 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That God created man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man became a living, moving creature called a soul or man. (Gen. 2:7) That God created man in his own likeness and image, meaning that man was endowed with wisdom, justice, love and power; that the creation of the man Adam was perfect. (Deut. 32:4) That God granted to man the right to live on earth and to enjoy the fruits of the earth on the express condition that he be obedient to God, and stipulated that a wilful violation of his law would result in death. (Gen. 2:17) That he placed Lucifer as the overlord of man. (Ezek. 28:13,14) That Lucifer rebelled against God, was guilty of treachery and treason and induced man to sin, which resulted in man’s being sentenced to death. (Gen. 3:17-19) That by inheritance all men have been born in sin and shapen in iniquity. (Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12) That thereafter the name Lucifer was changed by Jehovah, and thenceforth Lucifer has been called that old Serpent, Satan, the Dragon, and Devil; that the purpose and policy of Satan, the Devil, has ever since been to turn the creatures against the great Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Jehovah made promise that he would bring forth a seed which seed would redeem and bless all the families of the earth, and that this seed is Christ his anointed.—Gen. 12:1-3; 22:18; Gal. 3:16, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That in due time God sent his beloved Son to earth, and that he was made a man, that he might be the Redeemer of mankind. (Heb. 2:9; Phil. 2:7; John 3:16) That he was born of a woman, but was sinless, pure and holy. (Matt. 1:18-24; Gal. 4:4; Luke 1:35; Rom. 1:3) That he grew to manhood’s estate, and at the age of thirty years presented himself unto Jehovah and was accepted as the great Redeemer or Ransom for mankind. (Luke 3:21-23; Heb. 10:5-10) That Jesus died upon the cross and thereby provided the redemptive price for all men.—1 Tim. 2: 5, 6; Heb. 9:22-26; 1 Pet. 1:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That God raised Jesus out of death and exalted him to heaven and gave him a name above every name, and committed into his hands all power in heaven and earth, and that henceforth and for ever Christ Jesus is the great executive officer of Jehovah to carry out his purpose.—Eph. 1: 20-23 ; Heb. 1: 3, 4; Matt. 28:18; Heb. 2:7, 8; 1 Pet. 3:21,22; Heb. 7:15,16; Ps. 2:6; John 5:21,22; Isa. 9:6,7; Ps. 45:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Jesus taught his disciples, and, through them, all his followers, that Jehovah is the only true God and that the only means of obtaining life everlasting is to know God, and Christ Jesus, whom he has sent. —John 17: 3; 5: 24; 6: 40; 12: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That when Jesus was on earth God anointed him to be King and entered into a covenant with him for the kingdom, through which kingdom blessings must come to all the human race (Luke 22:29; 1:30-32; Heb. 6:20; Acts 2: 29, 30; 10: 38) ; and that since the ascension of Christ Jesus into heaven until the time for the establishment of God’s kingdom, Jehovah has been taking out from among men a people for his name, and these are invited into the covenant for the kingdom, and being anointed of the Lord and faithful unto the end will participate in the resurrection and be members of the kingdom.—Acts 15:14; Luke 22:29, 30; Rom. 8:15-17; 11: 28; 1 Pet. 2: 9,10; John 6: 51-56; Rev. 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That when Jesus was on earth he especially taught his disciples concerning the kingdom and the importance of his second coming and setting up of his kingdom (Luke 12:32-48) ; and that, therefore, the true followers of Christ Jesus have been looking forward to the second coming of the Lord and to the establishment of God’s kingdom through which the promised blessings will come to the human race. (Matt. 6: 9,10; Luke 11:2; 2 Pet. 3:12,13) That to this end the disciples propounded to Jesus the question as to what would be the proof of his coming and his kingdom, and his answer thereto is, in substance, that the beginning of the time would be marked by a world war, famine, and pestilences, to be followed by distress of nations, and then further enlightenment of those who are devoted to Jehovah. That the physical facts show that 1914 marks the beginning of the time when Christ the King was placed upon his throne by Jehovah.— Matt. 24; Rev. 11:15-19; Ps. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the people taken out from among the world as the true followers of Christ are “a people for his name” to give testimony concerning the name of Jehovah and his kingdom; and that the commandment to such is that they must be witnesses for the Lord in the earth to serve notice upon the rulers and the people concerning God’s purposes, and particularly with reference to his kingdom. (Matt. 24:14; Isa. 43:10-12) That from and after 1918 is the time in which God’s name shall be exalted.—Ps. 102:16; Isa. 12:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the testimony concerning Jehovah, his name, his kingdom, and his purpose of overthrowing Satan and his wicked organization, must be given, and that this testimony or witness must be done by God’s anointed ones; and when finished, then Satan’s organization shall be destroyed in a time of trouble such as the world has never known, and this shall be the last.—Matt. 24:14, 21, 22; Rev. 16:13-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the reign of Christ, after the destruction of Satan’s organization, will result in the blessing of all mankind, in this, that all mankind shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth and be given a full and fair opportunity to be obedient to the Lord, and those who then obey and keep the words or teachings of Christ Jesus shall live and shall never die. (John 8:51; 11:25,26; Isa. 9:6,7) That these blessings will come to all, including those who are dead. That all the dead will be raised out of death and be given full opportunity for life together with those living on the earth. (John 5:28,29) That the wilfully wicked will be for ever destroyed, while the obedient ones shall be given life everlasting on the earth, and thus the purpose of God concerning man will be fully accomplished. (Isa. 35:8,9; Acts 3:22,23; 2 Thess. 1: 8, 9; Ezek. 18: 26) That the outworking of God’s purpose, and the manifestation thereof, will result in exalting the name of Jehovah and will teach all creation that he is the only true and almighty God, that from </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> all blessings flow, and that he is the only source of life everlasting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>NOT PROPAGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Neither the above-mentioned corporations nor “the Society” indulge in propaganda work in any manner. Neither members nor money are sought. These followers of Christ who believe the Bible teachings take no credit themselves for these truths, but consider themselves as God’s witnesses and that the obligation rests upon them to call the attention of other people to these wonderful truths because they exalt Jehovah God and teach men the way to obtain life everlasting. Since neither “the Society” nor any one connected therewith makes any effort to induce others to become members of the organization, or makes any effort to propagate an organization as such, it can not be said that “the Society” or any of these corporations is engaged in propaganda work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They believe that the commandment given to the followers of Christ is that they must preach the gospel; and, being sent forth as God’s witnesses, they do preach the gospel unselfishly and in obedience to God’s commandments. They hold that preaching the gospel means proclaiming or telling the good news, and that this is done in various ways, to wit: by holding public meetings and speaking to the people; by employing the radio for broadcasting the message of God’s Word; by printing in magazine and book form and in tracts the same message and placing it in the hands of the people, and by going from house to house and furnishing these to the people at a nominal cost. In no instance is this done for the purpose of inducing anybody to become a member of any organization or to contribute any money; but the sole purpose is to bring to the knowledge of the people God’s purpose as expressed in the Bible, in order that the people may benefit thereby. The nominal sum of money taken for booklets or books delivered to the people is used to defray expenses and further carry on the witness work as hereinbefore set out, and not for the purpose of reaping pecuniary profit or gain. In thus preaching the gospel these Bible Students are exercising their divinely-given right and commission, and are clearly within their rights, under the laws of the land, in engaging in a charitable, benevolent and uplifting work to the public benefit and to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The annual convention of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society met at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 31st day of October, A.D. 1929. After opening with prayer the first order of business taken up was the president’s report. The report being very lengthy, after giving a resume of the same a motion was made and seconded and unanimously adopted that the president be instructed to print the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report was very gratifying, and the anointed will read it with much pleasure, because it shows that the Lord’s people have had his blessing during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The president then announced that this annual meeting could entirely dispose of all business, so far as the Lord is concerned, and fully meet the requirements, but that a doubt had arisen concerning the legality, under the Pennsylvania statute, of the casting of the official vote and that for this reason the board of directors had passed a resolution deferring the casting of the official vote of the annual meeting until December 2, when the meeting would be held at Pittsburgh, North Side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The convention proceeded then to place before it and vote upon the names for a board of directors and officers, in order that the will of the Lord’s people might be expressed in convention. The following-named persons were placed in nomination before the convention for directors, to wit: J. F. Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Amburgh, R. J. Martin, A. H. Macmillan, H. H. Riemer, and E. J. Lueek. By unanimous vote these were declared to be the ones desired for directors during the next three years. Thereupon a motion was duly made and seconded that J. F. Rutherford should be the president and be elected to serve for the next three years. This motion being put, it was unanimously carried. Also by unanimous vote the following other officers were named: C. A. Wise, vice-president; W. E. Van Amburgh, secretary and treasurer; H. H. Riemer, assistant secretary and assistant treasurer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following resolution in the form of a protest against the arrest and persecution of the brethren for preaching the gospel was unanimously passed by the convention, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The International Bible Students in annual convention assembled at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 2, 1929, do hereby issue the following statement and protest, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That this Association of Christian people is created and organized solely for the purpose of worshiping God and preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom; that all those associated together in such work devote such time as they reasonably can to thus serving God and preaching the gospel; and that the means employed to so preach the gospel are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By public speech or proclamation in halls or other buildings; by the use of the radio to broadcast the gospel; by the publication of such gospel and Bible instruction in book form; by calling upon the people in their homes and exhibiting to them such books or booklets containing the gospel message, infor</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">g the people that it is the gospel, and leaving with them as many copies as they may desire and taking from such person or persons a nominal sum of money, which money is used to defray the expense of carrying on the work of this Association in preparing and preaching the gospel of the kingdom as aforesaid, and that the same is not done for pecuniary gain or profit; that Jesus Christ sent forth his twelve disciples from house to house to preach the gospel (Luke 9: 1-4), that they and the Apostle Paul publicly preached from house to house, that Christ and his apostles were prosecuted and persecuted for preaching the gospel, and that these Bible Students are but following in the same course and manner of preaching the gospel as that employed by Jesus and his apostles; that the enemies of the kingdom of God caused the prosecution and persecution of Jesus and his apostles for so preaching the gospel, and that during the Dark Ages the followers of Christ were arrested, prosecuted, and persecuted for preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That in recent months those who oppose the gospel of God’s kingdom have caused the arrest, prosecution and persecution of a number of Bible Students for preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, and particularly for preaching the same on Sunday in the manner aforesaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">NOW THEREFORE RESOLVED that we as humble and earnest followers of Christ Jesus and as witnesses for Jehovah God do solemnly protest against the arrest, prosecution, and persecution of men and women for preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, whether the same be preached on Sunday or on any other day during the week, and that we call upon all officers of the law of the land to see to it that all persons, including the Bible Students, be given full freedom to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience by preaching the gospel at any and all times as they may so desire, which right the Constitution of the United States guarantees to every person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the gospel of God’s kingdom is convenient, necessary, and beneficial to the general public, and its preaching in any and all forms should be encouraged by any and all orderloving people.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE PRESIDENT’S REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">To Jehovah’s Anointed: It is my privilege and pleasure to report to you the activities of the Society during the fiscal year just closed. Aside from God’s anointed company few will be interested in this report, and none other will fully appreciate it. During the year the anointed have had in mind the text chosen for the year, to wit: “I will sing praise to my God.” The anointed know that Jehovah is the only true God; that Satan is his adversary and the god of the evil world; that soon the conflict between the Most High and the enemy will reach a climax and in the great battle of God Almighty the enemy organization will be for ever destroyed, and that the blessing of the people will follow. It is the privilege of the anointed to bear witness to these facts and to notify the rulers and the people of this world what God will cause to shortly come to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus, the Head of God’s anointed servant, greatly rejoices in the work of vindicating his Fa-tier’s name, and all those of the temple are invited to participate in that joy, and all in the temple do show forth the glory of Jehovah. The singing forth of the praise of our God has therefore been a great joy to the anointed during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, many obstacles have been placed in the way of the anointed servant during the year, but the remnant understand the reason therefor and are not discouraged. They know that The New Nation is born and that Christ is on his throne; that Satan has been cast out of heaven and is now confining his activities to things pertaining to the earth, and therefore great woe has come to the inhabiters of the earth; and that Satan takes advantage of this opportunity to persecute those who love the Lord. The enemy, the god of this world, is exceedingly angry because he knows that his time is short to prepare for the final conflict, and his anger is increased by the continuous singing of the praises of Jehovah by God’s anointed witnesses. Jehovah committed to Jesus Christ the obligation and privilege of giving the testimony in earth concerning the purposes of the Most High, and Jesus has graciously taken in his feet members and given them a part in making known this testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same remnant class has received the commandment of God to be his witnesses and to lift up a standard for the people and point them toward the kingdom. This they have been trying to do during the year. Foreknowing what would come to pass, the Lord foretold the present conditions and the opposition to his witnesses, in these words: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. ’ ’—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the remnant see themselves exactly in the position foretold in the Lord’s Word, they know that as members of the servant they must suffer persecution even as Christ was persecuted. They know that the reproaches that fell upon God, and then upon Christ Jesus, have now fallen upon the feet members, and they rejoice to fill up the sufferings of Christ that were left behind for their sake. They see their blessed privilege of being witnesses to the name of Jehovah, and they delight to be the targets of the enemy’s darts. The opposition during the year has not discouraged them, but, on the contrary, has increased their faith and reassured the anointed that they are in the right way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>BLINDED AGENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has employed many agencies to do his evil work against the remnant. Many thus inveigled into his service are deceived by him and blinded to the truth, and for this reason he can use them. The anointed keep in mind the facts as they exist, and hence do not permit the opposition or persecution by the blinded agents of Satan to embitter them even against their enemies. Religious systems of the world have long been engaged in propaganda work. They have defamed the name of Jehovah by causing many people to believe that God is pleading with men to come to heaven while the Devil is fighting against God and getting most of them into hell. These systems have commercialized their religion and have used the same to obtain both money and members for their organizations. Because of these conditions many conscientious people of the world believe that all organizations pertaining to the Bible are engaged in a propaganda work. Such conclusion is due to the fact that they are blinded to the truth. Those who are devoted to Jehovah God could not be engaged in a propaganda work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Representatives of the Society appeared at a hearing before a committee of the United States Senate. Members of that senatorial committee classed the Society with other organizations engaged in propaganda, and expressed the belief that our Society is carrying on a work to obtain members and money and to propagate doctrines or ideas as do religious organizations. In this the senatorial committee is wrong. Not for any selfish reason would we attempt to set the senatorial committee or others right in this matter ; but that the name of Jehovah God may be magnified we insist on telling the truth concerning the Society’s work, and the truth is that the Society is not engaged in propaganda work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth belongs to Jehovah, and to no men or organization of men. It is his message, and not the message of man. The anointed servant merely acts in the capacity of the bearer of God’s message to the people. It would be impossible for man to propagate (or cause to multiply) the Word or message of God. Men can not do anything to God’s Word. The word “propaganda” originated with an aggregation of cardinals of the Roman Catholic church organization, which organization has at all times devoted itself to spreading the tenets of Catholicism in an effort to add members to the organization and to obtain money to support the same. Such is truly a propaganda work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was Satan the enemy who began and who has carried on a progaganda work, and now he would cause that odium to attach to the work in connection with the witness given to the name of Jehovah. The word has no proper application whatsoever to God’s anointed. God needs no one to propagate his truth, and no one can do it. His Word is the end of all controversy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The commission of God’s anointed is to preach the gospel. (Isa. 61:1-3; 2 Cor. 5:20) The gospel, or good news, is from Jehovah and has been committed to Jesus Christ, and is therefore properly spoken of as the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not the gospel of men, nor of any organization of men. To the Society is given the commission and committed the work of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. The Society is made up of a number of the Lord’s servants. In carrying out this commission, the Society is merely acting as a messenger of Jehovah and of Christ. Whether the people hear or refuse to hear is of no effect so far as the action of God’s anointed servant is concerned. To his anointed servant God gave the commandment, ‘ ‘ Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.” (Isa. 6:9) In preaching his good news to mankind the anointed are acting merely in obedience to this and similar commandments from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s due time is here to completely oust the enemy and set up the righteous kingdom. This he will not do by stealth or in secret, but will have notice thereof served upon the rulers and peoples of earth. He commands his anointed servant to give such notice. The rulers of the world will not understand and accept the message. The message, however, will be delivered, because it is God’s will that it shall be. Among the common people many will hear and rejoice that the day of deliverance is at hand, and the evidence shows that many have heard and rejoiced in the year that has closed, and doubtless many of these will be in proper attitude for the blessings of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The more fully the anointed understand the duty and obligation laid upon them, the greater is their joy. One of their methods of preaching the gospel is by going from house to house and telling the people the truth, and putting the message of truth in their hands in book form. No one is asked to join anything, nor is any one solicited for money. A nominal sum of money is taken for the books that are delivered to the people, and is used to further carry on the Lord’s work. This manner of doing the Lord’s work in these last days seems clearly to have been foreshadowed by Jehovah’s dealing with Israel, and his instruction to them concerning the people of Egypt.—Ex. 12: 35, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The anointed are, in fact, doing the peoples of the world a great favor by thus preaching to them the gospel of God’s kingdom. But that favor to the people is not the moving cause, nor the principal reason for the course of action taken by the Lord’s anointed. The business of the anointed is to act as witnesses for Jehovah and to tell the people that He is God, and that his kingdom is at hand. (Isa. 43:10-12; Matt. 24:14) God has put his message in the mouth of the anointed class and sent these forth as his representatives. They expect to be persecuted and opposed, but the Lord God will look to their proper protection while engaged in his work.—Isa. 51:16; Ps. 91:1, 2.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>ARRESTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the year many of the colporteurs and class workers have been arrested and haled into court, charged with violation of laws and ordinances relative to selling goods and merchandise without a license, and also charged with violation of laws pertaining to Sunday. They have felt it their duty and privilege to resist such prosecutions. Being in the world, it is their right to take advantage of the protection which the law provides for all. To this end lawyers have been employed and legal defense has been made in the courts of the respective states where the arrests have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having nothing to conceal, there is herein set forth the position taken by the Lord’s anointed as to the right of those of the Society to call at homes, to offer and deliver books to others, and to take a sum of money therefor. Our position before God and before the courts of the world may be briefly stated as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FIRST: That the Bible Students engaged in the Lord’s witness work are fully consecrated to do the will of God, and are anointed by Jehovah as the followers of Jesus Christ and as servants of the Most High; that they understand and believe it to be their right, duty and commission as such followers of Jesus Christ to worship God and serve him by preaching the gospel as commanded in the Bible, which is the Word of God, and particularly as such commandment and commission is set forth in the following Scriptures, to wit, Isaiah 61:1-3 and 2 Corinthians 5:20; that the anointed Bible Students, and each of them, avail themselves of opportunities to so worship God by preaching the gospel on every reasonable occasion; that in so doing they do not attempt to unduly influence others, nor do they make an effort or attempt to induce any person or persons to join any organization, nor do they take up any collections of money, but they so worship God by preaching the gospel because it is their duty and privilege so to do in the free exercise of their religious belief; that their method of worshiping and serving God is by preaching the gospel, to wit: by calling on the people at their homes and speaking to them of and concerning the Bible and God’s provision as set forth therein for the uplifting and blessing of the human race by and through his kingdom, and in so doing they exhibit to the person or persons called upon books, pamphlets and magazines containing in printed form the gospel sermons or instruction in the Bible; and if any person or persons to whom they thus exhibit such publications desire to avail themselves of one or more of such books, pamphlets, or magazines, the anointed Bible Student leaves the book or books, pamphlets, or magazine with such person or persons and takes therefor a nominal sum of money; that the sum of money so taken for such publications is not for personal gain or pecuniary profit, but goes toward and is used in defraying the actual expense of publishing and delivering such books, pamphlets, or magazines; that many Bible sermons are broadcast by radio, and thus the people hear the gospel by radio in their homes, and the practice of the anointed Bible Students is to call at the homes and place in the hands of the people further Bible instruction or sermons as above stated and in harmony with what has been radiocast; that in so doing they are freely exercising their religious liberty of preaching the gospel, as guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land; that since the Lord Jesus Christ treated the Sabbath or Sunday the same as any other day, and preached the gospel on that day, his servants pursue a similar course and use Sunday as well as other days of the week to preach the gospel as hereinbefore set forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SECOND: That the books, pamphlets, and magazines so distributed and placed in the hands of the people as stated in paragraph one are made, printed and published jointly by the following religious, charitable and benevolent corporations, to wit, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, created and organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, the Peoples Pulpit Association, created and organized under the laws of the State of New York, and the International Bible Students Association, created and organized under the laws of England, all of which maintain an office at Brooklyn, N. Y., and that all of said corporations are engaged jointly in carrying on the work of Bible instruction and preaching the gospel; that they are chartered for the purpose of disseminating Bible truths, preaching the gospel, and instructing men and women in a better understanding of the Scriptures, and the anointed Bible Students cooperate with the said corporations above mentioned in disseminating Bible truths for the good of the people. The books, pamphlets, and magazines so published and placed in the hands of the people belong to the publishing corporation until delivered and paid for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THIRD: That the work in which the anointed witnesses of God thus engage in going from house to house and speaking to the people, and delivering books and taking a nominal sum of money therefor, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is not selling and offering for sale books or goods, wares or merchandise,</span><span class="font7"> but is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom.</span><span class="font7"> The said work is beneficial to the general public and is engaged in by the said anointed Bible Students because of their love for God and love for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FOURTH: That the anointed Bible Students do, on Sundays and week days at such times as the occasion offers, call at the homes or houses of the people and exhibit to them books, pamphlets, and magazines which are devoted exclusively to Bible instruction, and particularly with reference to God’s kingdom and his means of blessing the human race; that never more than 45^ is taken for a book of 385 pages bound in cloth, gold-stamped and illustrated, and never to exceed 10^ is taken for a paper-covered book of 64 pages; and that these sums so taken are merely nominal and go toward defraying expenses of publication and delivery of the message of truth; that said anointed Bible Students never ask a permit from any of the law authorities to so engage in the said work, because in so engaging in such work they are merely freely exercising their right to preach the gospel as guaranteed by the laws of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FIFTH: That the anointed Bible Students never on any occasion while engaged in such work cause any breach of the peace, or disturbance of any one’s peace, but, on the contrary, quietly and in a dignified manner explain, to those who will listen, that this is their method of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom through which God will bless the peoples of earth, and that these books so exhibited fully explain these matters of truth contained in the Bible, and that the canvasser is merely affording the people an opportunity to know about such truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SIXTH: That the anointed Bible Students so engaged in said work have at heart the general welfare and well-being of the people, and have an honest and sincere desire to aid the people to live a life of cleanliness and righteousness, and that they might know of and concerning God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SEVENTH: That the work of the anointed Bible Students in going from house to house and calling upon the people and exhibiting to them the books is a work of necessity for the well-being of the people; that it is a religious work in this, that it has to do with informing the people of God’s Word and is the Bible Students’ method of exercising their religious convictions and belief as defined by the fundamental law of the land; that it is a charitable work because it is a service rendered for the benefit of mankind and without pecuniary gain or profit to those rendering the service; that the corporations or associations publishing the books aforesaid are organized, conducted, and carried on for the good of mankind, and for this reason are exempted by law and practice from taxation; and that the canvassers are therefore cooperating with such corporations for the well-being of the people, and to give honor to the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord forewarned that there would be those who were once enlightened with the truth and who would then turn aside therefrom and make common cause with the enemy organization and engage in opposition and persecution of the faithful remnant. (Ps. 50:16-21) This prophecy we see in fulfilment now, but the faithful are in no wise discouraged thereby. “The Lord’s hand is not shortened,” but his work goes grandly on.—Isa. 59:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HEAD OFFICE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7">The head ofiice of the Society is maintained at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, U. S. A. From this point the three corporations hereinbefore named are managed. The Year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font7"> for 1929 gives a detailed statement as to the work in cooperation of these three corporations, and reference is made thereto for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every person at the Bethel home is assigned a specific task or work to do, and each one goes about </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font7">in an orderly manner. Because each one does his part without stopping to inquire of the work done by another, and because the spirit of the Lord controls, there is full cooperation. The members of the family appreciate the fact that they are engaged in the King’s business, and that the King’s business requires care, diligence, and even haste. They do much more work than persons of the world who engage in worldly vocations; and because they do their work joyfully and unto the Lord, it is easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bethel is a place of real joy, and it is a delight to serve with those who are there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Berean study conducted every Monday evening exclusively for the benefit of the Bethel family is the weekly occasion of joy and helpfulness. For some months past during the year, this study has been confined to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font7"> book. Jehovah made a covenant with Jesus for the kingdom or government, and those that will form the body members of Christ have been invited into that covenant. To such the kingdom or government is of the very greatest importance. It is with keen interest that they study the Bible concerning God’s government. In fact, almost all prophecy points to the government of the Lord. These Berean lessons draw the members of the family closer together and enable them to more fully appreciate the Lord and his loving-kindness, and likewise increases their love for one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having observed the many blessings that have come to the Bethel family as a result of the Monday evening Berean study, as well as other Berean studies, all ecclesias through the earth are strongly urged to have one general Berean study a week at which all the members of that ecclesia may attend and have a part therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manner of conducting such Berean study is of very great importance. The most satisfactory manner of conducting the study has been found to be as follows : After opening the meeting with song and prayer, the leader selects one of the class present and invites him to come to the front and do the reading for the class during the evening. At the direction of the leader, the reader then reads one or two paragraphs of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> or book that is being studied, and then the leader calls for questions relating to the subject matter read. These questions must be confined to the subject matter under consideration and what has been read, in order that the study may be kept within proper bounds and the most profit may result. The leader then calls upon several to briefly express their answers to the question propounded, and then invites a general discussion by any who may desire to briefly express their views. Then the leader briefly sums up the matter. When the questions relative to the paragraphs read have been discussed and disposed of, then another paragraph or more is read and the lesson proceeds in like manner. There is never a dull moment in the Bethel Berean study. It is a most profitable meeting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>PRAYER MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Other Berean studies are held on other evenings of the week at the Bethel home. On Wednesday evening there is a prayer and testimony meeting in which all the Bethel family participate and which is attended by others of the congregation. This meeting is a great blessing to all who are privileged to attend. The text for the week is considered, and the testimonies given are in line with the proper understanding of the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DAILY ROUTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of necessity the Bethel home must be conducted in an orderly way. No other way would be pleasing to the Lord. To this end, rules are had for the government of the home. A printed copy of the rules is placed in the hands of each one who enters the home for service. He is requested to study these rules and abide by them. At 6:30 o’clock in the morning the rising signal is sounded. Every one is expected to rise immediately, take a bath and prepare for the day. At 7 a.m. the breakfast signal is sounded and the entire family assembles in the dining-room. The morning devotion is led by the president when present. When he is absent, some one else is designated to fill this place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morning devotion consists of singing a song previously selected for the day. Then prayer is offered by the one leading or by some one whom he requests. After this the blessing upon the food is asked by some member of the family. Following that, the breakfast meal is served; and during the service the Bible text for the day is read and is freely discussed by the members of the family, particularly those who are elders in the ecclesia. At the conclusion of the discussion and the reading of the comment contained in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font7"> the president sums up in a brief statement especially appropriate to the daily text. The family then stands while being dismissed with prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At eight o’clock in the morning all members of the family are expected to be diligently performing their respective duties. Some operate the laundry, others mend shoes or press clothes, others prepare the food, others cook it, others wash the dishes and give attention to the dining-room, while still another company cares for the house. Each one performs his service</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">faithfully as assigned, doing it always as unto the Lord because he is doing service that is necessary in carrying on the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All who are admitted to the home and assigned to service first file a questionnaire declaring that they are fully consecrated to the Lord and in full harmony with the work that the Society is doing. The purpose is to have the members of the family in full harmony and working with one object in view, namely, that of proclaiming the gospel of God’s kingdom. It will readily be seen that no one is expected to remain at the home unless he performs service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At noon an hour is given for the serving of the food and the discussion of Bible questions. Any one of the family, or any one visiting the family, may propound a Bible question. The one presiding calls upon various brethren to give their expressions on the question and then there is a free and open discussion of the question by any who may desire to participate therein. At the conclusion, the one leading sums up the question by covering the points that have been previously brought forth. A similar course is followed at the evening meal. In fact, at the time of serving each meal in the dining-room there is also time and occasion for the study of the Bible, and the time is so occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition thereto, all members of the household have time for personal and private Bible study in their respective rooms; so, in fact, every room in the house is devoted to the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is entitled to all credit and honor for the radio, because it is his creation. He now permits his people to use the radio as a means of preaching his gospel of truth. In America the radio method of preaching the gospel has been greatly blessed by the Lord during the year. A number of stations in Canada ■under contract with members of the Society have also regularly broadcast the truth throughout the year. The Society has contracted with a 10-kilowatt station in Tallinn, Esthonia, which sends forth the message of truth every Sunday. Preaching the gospel by radio has also been done during the year in Switzerland, Holland, India, Australia, and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio stations WBBR of New York and WORD of Chicago are owned and operated by the Society, and devoted to preaching the gospel. In addition thereto the Society has very favorable contracts with stations WHK of Cleveland, Ohio, and KFWM of Oakland, California; and these stations, on Sundays and week days, broadcast the truth message in the English and other languages. Many local classes have also made very favorable arrangements with their local stations for broadcasting the truth message each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the close of the year the Society is completing the construction of well-arranged and beautiful studios at 124 Columbia Heights, in connection with the Bethel home. There is one large studio for orchestra and other music productions, a small studio for lectures, a control room for operation, one audition and receiving room, two practice rooms, and the station manager’s office. These studios are connected by wire with the transmitter situated twenty-five miles away on Staten Island. Thus will the studios afford an opportunity for members of the Bethel family to participate in the programs without the loss of so much time and energy in traveling to and from Staten Island. Henceforth these studios will be the place of origin of the chain programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the total number of 168 radio stations in the United States and Canada have been used to broadcast the gospel of the kingdom. Local ecclesias have provided the greater number of these programs each week. At the close of the fiscal year there were 133 radio stations broadcasting the gospel message of truth each week. Stations WBBR and WORD broadcast the gospel of the truth each day of the week except one. Exclusive of these two stations the number of programs broadcast by the Society during the year total 11,624. That was an average of 222 programs each week, making a total of 11,854 hours employed in such programs on all these stations, or an average of 32 hours a day for all of these stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Generally the gospel message of truth preached by radio is in the English language, but in addition thereto the gospel has been preached and radiocast during the year in languages other than the English as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CHAIN BROADCASTING</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7">By chain broadcasting is meant that one station is used as the key or station of origin of programs. Other stations are linked with the station of origin by means of telephone wires, and all the stations so linked together constitute the chain and simultaneously broadcast the same program. On November 18, 1928, the watchtower chain programs began. These programs originated at Station WBBR, New York. At the beginning there were eleven other stations tied in with WBBR, making a total of twelve stations in the chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each Sunday morning thereafter a similar sixtyminute program, sponsored by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font7"> has been distributed in the same manner to a steadily increasing audience. From time to time during the year other stations in the United States and Canada have joined this chain. On the five Sundays of the past month (September) the program was radiocast simultaneously by the following thirty stations:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">CKOC Hamilton, Ont. KFEQ St. Joseph, Mo. KQV &nbsp;&nbsp;Pittsburgh, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">KSOO &nbsp;&nbsp;Sioux Falls, S. Dak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">KTNT Muscatine, Iowa WAIU Columbus, Ohio WBBR New York, N. Y. WBT Charlotte, N. C. WFBLi Syracuse, N. Y. WFIW Hopkinsville, Ky. WGBF Evansville, Ind. WGBI Scranton, Pa. WHDH Gloucester, Mass. WHK Cleveland, Ohio WHP Harrisburg, Pa.</span></p>

WOKO Poughkeepsie, N. Y. WORD Chicago, Ill. WOV New York, N. Y. WOWO Fort Wayne, Ind. WPTF Raleigh, N. C. WTAR Norfolk, Va. WW VA Wheeling, W. Va.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">This chain broadcasting arrangement, organized and operated exclusively for the Society by its agency, the Peoples Pulpit Association, with cooperation of the American Telephone &amp;&nbsp;Telegraph Company and the associated stations, is for convenience designated as the watchtower network.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Established and maintained altogether independently of existing American commercial chain broadcasting organizations, the watchtower network has functioned as an instrument to publish widely and effectively the good news of the government of Jehovah which those commercial chain companies have persistently and &quot;religiously” refused to accept for broadcasting, either free or for hire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This persistent refusal is the fruit of a deliberately studied policy of the most prominent of these companies, admittedly aided and counseled by the chief ones of &quot;organized Christianity” in America. That company’s decision, recorded here that the truth might be known, is based upon the expressed judgment of its president, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;... Judge Rutherford’s speech [‘Freedom for the Peoples,’ broadcast from Toronto, Canada, July 24, 1927, over the greatest number of stations assembled in a chain up to that time] was a rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy of all denominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;In view of that experience, the National Broadcasting Company cannot again permit its facilities to be used by him or his organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That decision, announced on May 5, 1928, unchanged to this date, stands in bold contrast with the expressed and unexpressed judgment of millions of people throughout all lands of the earth who either heard or subsequently read the speech mentioned, and who know exactly what the speaker said. The facts are unassailable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Notwithstanding the subtle attempt of the enemy and his misguided servants to throttle and suppress, the strong hand of Jehovah has guarded and prospered the use of instruments that are available for heralding the good news of his everlasting kingdom by means of these simultaneous broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On three occasions during the year special chain broadcasts were arranged for the purpose of radiocasting lectures delivered by the president of the Society. These chain programs were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">March 17 (station of origin, KMTR at Hollywood, California), in which nineteen stations were linked together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">April 21 (program originating at WBBR, New York), thirty-six stations simultaneously participating in the broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">August 25 (program originating at WBBR, New York), in which ninety-seven stations simultaneously engaged in broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Great numbers of telegrams and letters were received at this office following these chain broadcasts, expressing gratification on behalf of those who heard, and large numbers of orders for books were received as a result of these lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren have nobly borne their share of the burden of providing for the broadcasting of the truth by radio. The Lord has greatly blessed them in so doing. The gospel delivered by radio has broken down a tremendous amount of prejudice, and multitudes of the common people now gladly hear the truth. Nothing so well provides an entry into the homes as the radio. By means of the radio, hungry persons hear some truth, upon which they feed; and when the colporteur or class worker calls at these homes, those who reside there are anxious to have more truth. As some of the workers put it: the canvass has already been made and we need only to deliver the books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>BROOKLYN FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Much labor and effort must be put forth to supply the demand for the gospel of the kingdom in printed form. The preparation of the manuscript alone requires much time, effort, patience, and prayerful work. The Lord adds his blessing, and the result is pleasing. Then the manuscript goes to the proofreaders for careful reading and marking. Then it goes to the factory to be put in form for publication and distribution. The great machines that turn out the books at the same time furnish sweet music to the ears of the anointed ones who operate them. With each revolution of these machines the Lord’s servants may truly say, ‘The Lord has provided food for the hungry people. Blessed be the name of the Lord!’ Every man at his post of duty, and every one joyfully cooperating in doing his duty, and all being guided by the spirit of the Lord, brings satisfactory results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fiscal year has been a splendid one in the production of books, booklets, and magazines containing the message of the kingdom to the glory of Jehovah’s name. During the year extra time equal to sixteen and one-half days has been put in by the brethren who do the work. This extra time was necessary in order to get out the message on time. The regular work of each day (except Saturday and Sunday) is eight and one-half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increased demand for books and other literature during the year has made it necessary to purchase and install new and additional machinery. This has involved the outlay of considerable money, but the Lord has made ample provision. The effort is put forth at all times to do the work in the most economical way. As an example of economy it may here be said that in former times the metal used in making plates from which the printing is done was melted by means of gas burners. The Society has its own power plant now and produces its own electricity at the factory. Its consecrated mechanics have provided electric heaters, for use in the melting pots, and thus considerable saving of gas is effected. The effort is made to produce the literature at the very lowest possible cost, in order that the books may be placed in the hands of the peoples at the lowest cost to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the factory operated 271 working days of eight and one-half hours each. On some days as many as 18,000 bound volumes were produced; but, taking the year as a whole, the average daily production was 13,184 cloth-bound books and 28,890 Sixty-four page booklets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>MATERIAL USED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is rather difficult for one who has no personal knowledge of the Brooklyn factory to appreciate the amount of material used. This includes paper, cloth, ink, and other necessary things that go to make up the book. During the fiscal year closing, our factory at 117 Adams Street consumed 1,140 tons of book paper, 210 tons of booklet paper, 71 tons for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watch Tower,</span><span class="font7"> 109 tons for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> making a total of 1,530 tons of paper consumed during the year. This was an increase of 280 tons over the amount of paper material used for 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1928 we used 211,160 yards of cloth. In the fiscal year just closed there were 252,028 yards of cloth used, which was an increase of 40,868 yards over that of 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year there has been added to the factory machinery for the manufacture of ink used in the printing. In 1928, 24,550 pounds of ink were used, which was bought at a high price. During the fiscal year of 1929 we used 28,163 pounds of ink manufactured in our own plant at less cost. This was an increase of 3,613 pounds over that of 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The material above mentioned, together with glue, paste, cardboard, crash, backlining, thread, etc., has been need in producing the following publications:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, Year Book, Judgment, Oppression, Prosperity Sure, The Last Days, Where Are the Deadf Hell, Our Lord’s Return, Standard for the People, The Peoples Friend, Freedom for the People, </span><span class="font7">paper-covered </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Song Book.</span><span class="font7"> These publications were in eighteen languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to producing the ink used in the factory, we were also enabled during the year to produce 2,720 pounds of paint used for painting the property and buildings owned by the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Below is given a brief statement of the production by the Brooklyn factory for the fiscal year, compared with the production for the preceding year, to wit:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font7">The decrease in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is manifestly due to the fact that some have grown weary or cold and have turned aside. The work, however, has increased, due to the greater zeal of the faithful anointed ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to these publications we have printed in our plant 1,281,440 handbills, special question folders, radio slips and radio announcement cards, and other advertising material that the classes have ordered; also 3,550,000 special radio chain fliers for the August 25 broadcast. This makes a total of 4,831,440 pieces of literature that were distributed throughout the country in advertising the books and the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A comparison of the above figures makes clear that there was a great increase in the production of clothbound volumes and a decrease in the number of booklets. This is due to the fact that during the year 1929 there was no five-cent booklet published, and further, that during the past year the Society has stressed the distribution of cloth-bound books in preference to booklets. The friends have heartily fallen in line with this because they appreciated that a greater witness is left in a home where a cloth-bound book is placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we consider the number of pages that have been published during 1929, as compared with 1928, we find that 177,891,406 more pages have been printed in our factory in 1929 than in 1928. Of course, it takes far more material, machinery, and help to produce a cloth-bound book than to produce a booklet. It can therefore be appreciated that as far as individual pieces of literature are concerned the figures show a decrease, but there has been a real increase in production, and a greater witness has been given through the cloth-bound books than there would have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font7">given with booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">li</span><span class="font7"> the pages produced in our plant during 1929 could be formed into a ribbon the width of a page, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">41/2</span><span class="font7"> inches, by pasting all the pages together, we should have a ribbon of paper 100,512 miles long, with printed matter on both sides of the paper. This is equal to four times around the earth at the equator. This is proof that the truth is being sent forth in greater volume than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While the manufacture of the books is of primary importance, the distribution thereof amongst the people is likewise of great importance in order that the people may have a chance to know the truth. As the books are manufactured they are consigned to the branch depots, the colporteurs, and classes, while many others are disposed of directly to the people by mail and otherwise. Those thus shipped on consignment belong to the Society until they are disposed of and paid for. The distribution of the publications for the year will be read with keen interest by those who have a zeal for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the last fiscal year of the Society shipments have been made from the factory at Brooklyn, and the three depots in this country, at St. Louis, Chicago, and Oakland, to the number of 11,486,356 books and booklets. This is an increase of 2,613,828 over 1928, during which time we distributed 8,872,528 pieces of literature. Of this amount, 10,558,842 were printed in the English language, and 908,488 in foreign languages. The remaining 19,026 pieces shipped were Bibles, printed in all tongues. There was a marked increase in the sale of Bibles in 1929 over 1928, in which time we placed only 4,070. The increase is attributed to the dollar Bible which the Society has been offering with the combination of cloth-bound books. The pioneer colporteurs distributed 11,812 of these during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some other very interesting facts about the distribution are the following: Of the total amount, 3,008,075 were books and 8,459,255 were booklets. This includes, of course, the 4,949,662 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font7"> booklets which were placed in the hands of the people for five cents a copy. The percentages are about 26.2 books and 73.8 booklets. Of the grand total, 4,128,797 books and booklets were shipped to foreign branches, and the remaining 7,357,559 were distributed in the United States. Surely the class workers, pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs, and all who had a part in distributing this great amount received untold blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the latter part of the fiscal year the new book named </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font7"> was published. At the close of the fiscal year 384,518 volumes of this book had been distributed by the office. Of the other five bound volumes which are the more recent publications of the Society, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> still leads. During the year 567,550 volumes of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> were distributed by the Society. Distribution of this book during the year is greater than that of any previous year. Of the others of the series of books, the lowest number distributed was 405,962 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Making a few comparisons on the booklet distribution for the year we find that there were 8,459,255 booklets shipped, of which 4,959,662 were five-cent booklets, and 3,499,593 ten-cent booklets. Comparing this with the previous year, when we shipped 6,100,936 booklets, of which 1,994,932 were five-cent booklets and 4,106,004 were ten-cent booklets, it shows a decided increase in the five-cent booklets during the last year over 1928, but a decrease of 606,411 ten-cent</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">During the fiscal year the following disposition was made of the Society’s publications published in languages other than the English, to wit:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Comparing the booklets made with the booklets shipped, we find that the factory produced 132,964 more booklets during the year than were shipped. Comparing the production of cloth-bound books with the distribution of the same, we find that we produced 564,882 more bound books than were shipped. This is equal to 68 days’ supply, because we have been shipping at an average of 8,309 books daily for 362 days of the year. At this rate the year’s surplus would be a 68 days’ supply.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">By field service is meant the systematic organization and carrying on of the work amongst the people. The classes are instructed as to how to pursue this work, and how to call at the various homes and preach the gospel by word of mouth and by placing the message in printed form with the people. Great effort has been put forth by the anointed during the year to accomplish the work that has been done. Of course, this has not been done for a money consideration, as our enemies would have it understood, but has been prompted and accomplished wholly because of love for God and love for the people of earth. The work has been done with real joy by those who have had part in it. It has been done at a monetary sacrifice by almost all who have engaged in it, and yet with much good resulting to those who have done it. The good result is consciousness of the fact that those engaged in the work had been acting as witnesses for Jehovah and carrying the message of comfort to those who desire consolation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the year there were thirteen English-speaking, one Ukrainian, and two Polish brethren engaged in the regional service work. The English brethren visited and served 902 classes for a period of three days or more at each class, and gave instruction to 17,589 different brethren in the service work. They traveled a total of 111,034 miles, all at the expense of the head office of the Society. Much of the increased activities of the classes in the field is due to the efforts of these regional service directors. They have helped the classes to study and overcome adverse conditions in their territory, and enabled them to more thoroughly perfect their plans for carrying on the work. By experience these regional service directors have learned better how to do the work themselves, and are therefore of great help to the classes in the field work. The field workers are better prepared as to the manner of preaching to and addressing the people when calling upon them at their homes. More and more these regional service directors and the field workers are realizing and appreciating the fact that they are God’s witnesses carrying the message of good tidings to the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Considerable effort has been spent which probably eould have been better spent had there been less traveling by each one of the regional service directors. The management has therefore concluded that the entire country will be districted and a regional service director assigned to each district, who will devote his attention to that district for a year or more and will be available to the classes in his district to aid, comfort, instruct, and advise in carrying on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two Polish brethren of the regional service force worked only 162 days during the year, but in that period of time they served 69 classes, each for two or more days, and instructed 2,255 different workers in the field service. They traveled 4,074 miles, all of which was done at the expense of the head office of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Ukrainian regional service director was in the field 62 days, and during that period of time served 24 classes, instructed 290 brethren in field service, and traveled 4,046 miles at the expense of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is hoped that during the ensuing year regional service directors will be put in the field to serve the other foreign-speaking brethren.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It has been deemed advisable to hold many local conventions during the year, with the regional service directors present serving such conventions. Forty of such conventions have been held among the Englishspeaking classes, and each convention was attended by two or more regional service directors. The time at these conventions was occupied in the following manner: Forenoon and early part of the afternoon devoted to house-to-house calls or canvassing, led by the regional service directors. Late afternoons and evenings were devoted to instruction, discourses, and testimony meetings. The regional service directors used recent articles from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> describing the kingdom privileges that the anointed now have, and further explained to the brethren the great opportunities of now being witnesses to the name of Jehovah. Special meetings were had for discussion of field conditions by the regional service directors together with the local service directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meetings of the colporteurs in the vicinity with the regional service directors were also held, which meetings were also attended by prospective colporteurs. These conventions have proved a source of great encouragement and help to the friends who have participated therein. They have afforded an opportunity for many to participate in the preaching of the gospel who have not heretofore appreciated the great privileges that they might have in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were four Polish and one Ukrainian service conventions held and conducted in the same manner as above described, resulting in much benefit to those who participated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At stated times during the year certain periods have been designated as drives, in which the brethren who desired to do so unitedly went forth for the distribution of the gospel message by calling upon the people in their homes. The first was the campaign with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5$</span><span class="font7"> booklet, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font7"> and was had October 21 to November 4, 1928, and the second on January 1 to January 20, 1929. These two drives, in addition to subsequent placing of these booklets, netted a total of 1,399,500 volumes of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font7"> placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taking into consideration the prevalence of the flu epidemic, which disease spread throughout the country about that period of time, these campaigns showed a splendid result to the glory of the Lord. A comparison of the disposition of the bound volumes which were placed during the first four months of 1928 and of 1929 is also interesting, as they were influenced by the campaigns with the 5^ booklet. The drive in 1928, as we know, was with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font7"> and resulted in placing 900,000 in the hands of the people within that period, as against 1,399,500 of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font7"> in the subsequent drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the first four months of 1929 there were placed in the hands of the people 58,497 more of the bound volumes than were placed in the same period of time during 1928. These figures show a greater desire on the part of the people to have the message of truth. It furnishes further evidence as to why the enemy opposes the circulation of God’s gospel message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to instruct the anointed more fully as to their privileges under the laws of the land, 22,000 copies of the pamphlet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty to Preach</span><span class="font7"> were sent out during the year. They have resulted in much benefit, as is shown from the reports to the service department.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>IBSA WEEK MAY 19 TO MAY 28</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During that week there were in the field 7,511 workers, and they placed in the hands of the people the following number of volumes: books, 55,215; booklets, 121,664; making a total of 176,879 books and booklets containing the gospel message placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>BETHEL FAMILY IN THE DRIVE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In order that the members of the Bethel family might participate in the special service in the field, the factory and office of the Society were closed May 24 to 26. Nineteen members of the English-speaking brethren at Bethel were sent to serve classes, and especially lead in the field, in the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, and in Canada. Also one Polish, one Lithuanian, and three German brethren were sent out from the Bethel family to serve classes by leading in the drive, all the expenses, of course, being paid by the Society. In that time members of the Bethel family placed in the hands of the people books containing the gospel message of truth to the number of 2,239, and booklets to the number of 6,325, or a total number of 8,564 books and booklets. It was a season of great rejoicing on the part of the members of the Bethel family, and afforded them the privilege of participating with the other brethren in the field in that very blessed part of the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>IBSA WEEK AUGUST 25 TO SEPTEMBER 2</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Comparing the two special service weeks in May and August of 1928 with those of May and August of 1929, a healthy increase in the distribution of the books and booklets is noted. This continual growth in the output of the bound volumes shows the trend of our work and the increased interest of the people therein. The IBSA Week of August 25 to September 2, 1929, resulted in placing the following in the hands of the people by the workers: bound volumes, 67,861; booklets, 99,065; or a total of 166,926 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was a decided increase in the amount of literature placed in the hands of the people over the same period of time in 1928. This indicates above all the Lord’s continual favor and blessing upon the faithful anointed ones, and the carrying on of the witness to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event of the service weeks during the year was the work done by the new book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life. </span><span class="font7">Within one week there were placed in the hands of the people 31,169 volumes. Doubtless the radio chain broadcast of August 25 greatly stimulated the distribution of the new book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font7"> because it was announced by radio. The facts show clearly that the Lord used the radio to call the attention of the public to the message of the Kingdom, and that this furnishes an entry for those who call from house to house, and thus there is a cooperative movement between the radio and the field workers in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another interesting comparison is this: The 1928 report shows 400 more field workers in the service than in the same period of time in 1929, but with the reduced number of workers the number of calls, and of books placed in the homes of the people, was very materially increased. The Lord will accomplish his purpose whether there be few or many engaged in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A comparative statement of the literature placed in the hands of the people during the years 1928 and 1929 is as follows:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font7">The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the year 1929 was 3,410,276, or an increase of 32 percent over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the whole, 1929 surpasses anything in the way of field service yet experienced during the Society’s activities, and the Kingdom message goes grandly on as the little army of the Lord together lift up their voices and sing the praises of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing figures with reference to service week, which reports are made by the service department, are confined particularly to the classes and the class workers. We now come to the consideration of the colporteurs who work independently of the class workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work which the colporteurs have done during the past year is most encouraging, and serves as an added proof that the Lord’s time has come for a strenuous witness to be given to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>ENROLMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The increase in the number of colporteurs enrolled, which began about January, 1928, has continued throughout this year. The average enrolment of pioneers has been 1,132, as compared with 791 of last year. The peak was reached on July 10, 1929, at which time 1,339 were enrolled on the active list. The auxiliaries have shown somewhat of a decline since the first report of this fiscal year, dropping from 744 in October to 587 in September. However, the average of the entire twelve months was 635, as compared with 515 of the previous year. The peak was reached on October 25, 1928, with 752 auxiliary colporteurs. This gives us a combined average of 1,767 for the year, as compared with 1,306 for the year 1927-1928. When one considers that the total enrolment of pioneers and auxiliaries in 1922 was only 463, this later number becomes even more outstanding. Of this number, the average reporting weekly has been 834 full-time colporteurs and 409 auxiliaries. They have reported 910,356 and 179,496 hours, respectively, in the actual canvassing, or a total of 1,089,852. This averages 20.99 hours a week for the pioneers, and 8.45 for the auxiliari js.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>LITERATURE PLACED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The total literature distributed by all the colporteurs together amounts to 2,921,457. Of this amount 1,342,577 were cloth-bound books, 1,013,329 were 10^ booklets, and 565,551 5^ booklets. This is the first year in which a record has been kept of anything other than the cloth-bound books; therefore this is the only basis on which we can compare the work done by the colporteurs with previous years. This represents an increase of 92.5 percent over the total books distributed during last year, at which time 697,370 were placed. Prior thereto, the year 1925-1926 was the highest since 1924, at which time only 325,294 were placed. As is to be expected, the regular colporteurs placed the major portion of this literature, totaling 2,433,616 pieces, of which number 1,184,478 were cloth-bound books, 855,616 10^ booklets, and 393,522</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">booklets. Of the cloth-bound books, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> led with 241,029, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font7"> came second with 237,176. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font7"> promises to be a very popular book for the colporteurs, since during the one month of September, when it was first released to the public, 47,776 were distributed, or about one-fifth of the number of copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> placed during the entire year. The pioneers show an increase of 101.2 percent over the number of books distributed last year, which totaled 588,662. The auxiliary colporteurs distributed 487,841 pieces of literature; of which number 5^ booklets led with 172,029, bound books were second with 158,009, and 10^ booklets third with 157,713. Of the bound volumes, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font7"> held the lead with 31,045, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> came second with 29,526. The auxiliaries showed an increase of 45.4 percent over the total bound volumes distributed during 1927-1928, which amounted to 108,708.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>RECEIVED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This is the first year that a record has been kept of the total number of people who have received our literature, and it is most gratifying to report that, during the past year alone, 1,177,691 have received the message in some printed form. Of this number, 957,674 obtained the literature from regular colporteurs, and 220,017 from auxiliaries, which averages 1,148 recipients to a regular colporteur, and 538 for auxiliaries. Of the total number of recipients from the pioneers, 324,636 took single books and 227,514 took a combination of books, which totals 552,150 people who have obtained some of our cloth-bound books from pioneer colporteurs. A total of 89,330 took them from auxiliaries, which makes a total of 641,480 homes in which cloth-bound books have been placed by colporteurs during the past year. This represents an increase of 130.8 percent over last year. Of the combinations placed, the five books seem to be the most popular, and the two-book combinations came second. The six-book combination, which was first offered during September, is making rapid headway, and during that one month surpassed the five-book combinations, as might be expected.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>TERRITORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">With over 843 regular colporteurs reporting each week, as might be expected, there has been given in the United States the most thorough and complete witness in the history of the work. An analysis of the territory by counties reveals that, out of the 3,067 counties in the entire United States, about 767 are held by the classes; which leaves 2,300 open for pioneer colporteurs. During the past year pioneers have been assigned to work in 1,772, and in the business districts of 255 additional counties which have been held by classes. This totals 2,027 counties in which pioneer colporteurs have worked, leaving only 528 counties in the entire country which have not had some colporteur or class worker there to cover them. Of this number there are a good many counties which were worked during the summer of 1928 but which, of course, would not be considered in this year’s report. The analysis by states reveals that such states as New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, California, Delaware, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Oregon have been practically entirely covered during the past year by the colporteurs and classes, and even such states as Idaho, Nevada, and Utah, which are very sparsely populated and difficult to work, have received a very good witness. It is also gratifying to notice that during the past year we have had two pioneer colporteurs working in such a far distant point as Alaska, where they have been able to place a total of 3,409 pieces of literature in the hands of 910 persons. Of this number, 2,005 were clothbound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year there have been two pioneer colporteurs canvassing in Hawaii, placing 3,988 pieces of literature, of which number 2,609 were bound books. One auxiliary has been doing some work in the Philippines, placing 229 pieces of literature. One pioneer colporteur has been working in the Canal Zone and has placed 2,608 pieces of literature. In Panama there has also been one pioneer colporteur, who has placed 1,381 pieces of literature in the hands of 775 people. In Costa Rica we have had two pioneers and six auxiliary colporteurs, who have placed 2,073 pieces of literature in the hands of 1,083 persons. In Cuba there have been two pioneer colporteurs, placing 1,027 pieces of literature; and in Dutch Guiana we have had one pioneer and recently enrolled one auxiliary colporteur, who have been able to place a total of 502 pieces of literature. In Mexico we have had for a part of the year two pioneer colporteurs, who have placed 1,877 pieces of literature. In that country, which has been closed to the activities of various churches and denominations, the Lord has made it possible for some work to be done by these pioneer colporteurs, which they have carried on as an educational work which is beneficial to the people. We have recently enrolled one auxiliary colporteur in Colombia, South America, and a pioneer colporteur in Egypt, Africa, but we have not as yet received any reports from them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>FOREIGN COLPORTEURS IN THE U. S.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year we have had three Finnish pioneer colporteurs in the United States; 16 Greek colporteurs, of which eleven have been pioneer and five auxiliary; two Hungarian, of which one is a pioneer and one an auxiliary; five Italian; one Lettish pioneer; twenty Polish, of which eighteen have been pioneer and two auxiliary; six Spanish, of which five have been auxiliary and one pioneer. Many of these foreign-speaking brethren not only have confined their activities to people of their own nationality but have been able to place a number of books in the hands of people of various other nationalities, and it is most encouraging to see the way the Lord has been blessing them in their efforts. A detailed analysis of the work which has been done by these colporteurs follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taking all in all, the past year has been the greatest ever from the standpoint of the witness given by the colporteurs; and, judging from their many letters, they are rejoicing greatly in the blessings which they are receiving in the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following comparative list shows the active regular colporteurs enrolled during the fiscal year of 1928 and 1929 and previous years. It will be observed that in 1922 the number of colporteurs began to increase, and that there has been a gradual and steady increase of the number, culminating in the highest number reached in 1929. This is another proof that the great witness work that the Lord intended to begin in 1922 did begin and has been carried on since.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The space allotted to the annual report will hardly permit of a more detailed report of the activities of the field workers. Much more could be said, but this suffices to show that the Lord God has in the field a little band of noble soldiers of the cross. These see eye to eye the great truths now revealed; together they lift up the voice and sing unto the praise of our God. They are participating in the witness of Jesus Christ and joyfully keeping the commandments of Jehovah. They are a blessed company, and the Lord is rewarding their efforts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>LECTURE DEPARTMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society conducts a lecture department in connection with other methods of preaching the gospel of the kingdom to the people. These lectures are given in various languages by radio, and also by the holding of public meetings in various towns and cities of the land. During the year these lecturers have used the radio on 527 occasions, besides addressing 494 other public meetings. The attendance at the public meetings here mentioned has been 38,431. In addition thereto, these brethren have served 1,969 class meetings, with a total attendance of 113,164. They have traveled a total of 354,325 miles. All the expenses of this work are defrayed by the head office of the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>MAIL REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The total number of cards and letters received at the Adams Street (Brooklyn) office during the year was, to wit, 233,170. The total number dispatched was 213,214. By reference to the 1928 report it will be seen that this is an increase of 8,787 cards and letters received, and 47,590 letters and cards dispatched. The average number of pieces of mail received each week at this office was 4,663, while the average number of pieces sent out was 4,264.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>FINANCES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Curiosity causes many to inquire as to where the money comes from to do this work. Those really interested know that the money is supplied by voluntary contributions made by those who love God and his cause, and whom the Lord has provided with some means. This, together with the small sums taken for the disposition of books to the people, goes to make up the amount used in the Lord’s service. This includes the work done in America and foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This scope of work could not possibly be accomplished by any worldly concern, where each one must have a living wage for himself and for his family. The Bethel family live economically and their time is given for their food and shelter and a small amount for incidental expenses. Many engage in the Lord’s service after working hours and cover their own expenses. Many work regular working hours to provide a livelihood, and then delight to put in extra hours evenings and Sundays in carrying the message of gladness to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the Society has, by the Lord’s grace, been able to meet its financial obligations, and we have faith that the Lord will supply what is needed for the days to come. Heretofore he has prospered his people who use their financial means to do his work, and this they have had pleasure in doing. It is his good work which he has begun and which he will finish to his own glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>BRANCH FOR THE BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work amongst the blind in America is small in its scope, yet it is a real joy to have some part in taking the message to those who have no natural eyes but who have spiritual discernment. The year past has been a blessed one in this work. One public library that handles our books for the blind reports that these books are called for as quickly as they come in, and that there is a long waiting list amongst the blind to have them. Many interesting letters have been received showing how the blind have been blessed by the gospel message of the truth. The text and comments taken from the Year </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font7"> have been a great comfort to the blind who have had the opportunity to read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to this, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> is printed for the blind and sent outside the United States to Australia, South Africa, England, and Canada, while copies are also loaned to those who are too poor to subscribe.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>COLORED BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A few years ago the work amongst the colored brethren of the United States was organized separately, not for the purpose of separating those who are in the Lord, but with the thought of rendering more efficient service amongst the colored people. The Lord’s blessing upon this effort shows that it was a wise course to take. The colored brethren have their own organized classes, and many class workers and colporteurs in the field. They have put forth a splendid effort during the year past, and the results are gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pioneer colporteurs in the field have placed 33,490 cloth-bound books and 42,444 booklets, making a total of 75,934 during the year. The auxiliary colporteurs have a very fine record of 10,332 books and 15,694 booklets, or a total of 26,026.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report from the field shows that even though the industrial conditions are much worse than a year ago, the colored people are more inclined to take the books and read them. The hand of oppression weighs down upon them and they are anxious to see whence will come the relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increase and continued zeal of our brethren in the field is proof that the spirit of the Lord has guided in this work and that his blessing is upon it. Appended hereto is a resume of the work:</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>OTHER LANGUAGES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">At the Brooklyn headquarters the gospel message is translated and published in many languages, and because this is a part of the work at Brooklyn the report is given in connection with that of the head office. During the past year those who speak languages other than the English have been better organized in the United States. Prior to this year the clerk at the desk of each language has been required to take care of service, colporteurs, classes, accounts, correspondence, and translating. Recently it seemed wise to place the service and colporteur work under the general department of service and have it handled together with the English, leaving the brethren at the foreign desks to perform the balance of the work. This has proved a decided advantage. It took some time to get the organization in proper shape, but now the work is going on much better than it did in any time past. Henceforth it is the purpose of the Society to publish the service </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> in various languages and mail them out to the organized classes each month,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and this will enable them to keep better informed, and more closely in touch with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year 908,488 books and booklets printed in the foreign languages at Brooklyn were sent out from the factory. Of this number, 472,272 were sent to branch offices, and 436,214 were placed in the hands of foreign-speaking people of America. A splendid witness has been given to the name of Jehovah by our foreign-speaking brethren during the year. Where-ever possible, arrangements have been made for the broadcasting by radio of lectures in these various languages. It is true that there has been some falling away, as the Lord foretold and as therefore to be expected; but the really earnest and zealous ones are pressing on with greater zeal than ever before, and the results give praise to the name of our God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The report of the branch offices in foreign countries is here submitted, taking the countries in alphabetical order. The brethren throughout America have some hardships and difficulties to overcome, to be sure, but when they read about the obstacles met by our brethren in some of the far-away countries, doubtless they will be encouraged, and, lifting up their hearts with thanksgiving, will press on. The privilege of now engaging in the service of the Lord’s army can not be overstated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In spite of all the opposition that the enemy has put forth, the work in South Africa goes grandly on. The report for the year is clearly marked with the Lord’s blessing. The following excerpts are taken from the report of the local manager at Cape Town:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has blessed the efforts of his anointed ones in this land during the past twelve months as they have sought with joy to fulfil their commission and be true and faithful witnesses. It is with deep gratitude to Him, without whose help we could do nothing, that the following report is submitted. During the year the good news of the kingdom has been heralded from the Cape, in the south, to the Zambesi, in the north, and from Durban and Loureneo Marques, in the east, to Luderitz and Swakopmund, in the west. Additionally, inquiries for literature have been received by post from as far north as Kenya Colony, in British East Africa; Tanganyika and Nyasaland, in British Central Africa, and the Belgian Congo. The total of books and booklets distributed is in excess of that of last year by 26,035, which is quite a healthy increase, when it is remembered that the laborers are few and far between, and conditions in the field very often difficult in the extreme. A summarized report follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103,435</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166,478</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark294"></a><span class="font6">COLPORTEURS: The colporteurs continue to be the main line of attack. Some come and others go, and a few keep on going on year in and year out. Our monthly average during the past year went up from seven to twelve. These brave eoldiers of the King have rendered yeoman service in pressing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Calls made numbered 57,015; and books placed, 46,607, of which 60 percent were bound volumes. These figures represent a substantial increase over last year’s figures. The work in the Union of South Africa goes steadily forward. Four brothers and five sisters have been in the service almost continuously throughout the year. With the exception of Zululand, which was systematically canvassed for the first time, all the territory was worked previously, and increasing interest in the kingdom message is reported from all corners of the country. Several of the full-time workers have of necessity had to work under extremely lonely and trying conditions, but with admirable fortitude they have stuck to their ‘ ‘ guns ’ ’ and endured much hardship joyfully that the good news of the kingdom might be carried far and wide. For the first time in the history of the work a colporteur penetrated into the vast mandated territory of South West Africa (322,400 square miles), which before the war was known as German West Africa. The European population is about 25,000, of whom 60 percent are of British and Dutch descent and 40 percent are German. The urban or workable population is rather less than 12,000. In the brief space of four months this zealous worker (a sister), who can speak English and Afrikaans fluently and some German, traversed the country, traveling 5,000 miles and visiting 30 towns, villages, mines and stations, made 2,151 calls, and placed 3,369 books in English, 1,549 books in German, and 1,470 in Afrikaans and Hollandish, a total of 6,388 books in all. As conditions in that territory are somewhat ‘ ‘ wild ’ and even dangerous for a woman, it required some courage to go, but, assured that she was the best one fitted for the job, her attitude was, “Here am I; send me”; and in the strength which the Lord supplies she gave out the message with boldness. The Lord’s approval was abundantly manifested, as the report shows. Her experiences make interesting reading. The following is a typical example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The consternation is so great in the camp of the Mi dianites that one preacher wired from Keetmanshoop to Luderitz, a distance of 227 miles, warning his flock of my approach and the ‘pernicious books I’m selling’. The man receiving the wire at the other end could not make it out, but took it to the police and told them that he had received a wire warning against books about ‘ raserny’ (Afrikaans for madness). The policeman helped him right, whereupon he appealed to them to cooperate in warning the people. When I walked into the office, blissfully ignorant of this, he listened very attentively and took a set of twelve (Volumes 1 to 7 with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government).</span><span class="font6"> Then he called in two others, and one more set of twelve was placed. After taking these sets the head of the police carried my case for a whole block and personally introduced me to the magistrate and his staff. There I placed another set of twelve with the magistrate, and Judge Rutherford’s five books with the assistant. That was how they cooperated! Each attempt to thwart the work of the Lord ends the same way.’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another colporteur sister has just canvassed the urban population of Southern Rhodesia (area 150,344 square miles). This territory was successfully worked three years ago by brothers, but on this occasion the results have been even better than formerly. Opposed at numerous places by magistrates and police (some of whom still have the “wind up’’ over the native trouble of four years ago), who did everything in their power to hinder the work, she fought her way single-handed from Umtali, on the borders of Portuguese East Africa, to Bulawayo and gave a good witness to the Lord’s praise. A brother, who is a native African, spends his whole time under our direction in giving the witness to the native peoples of the Union. Although greatly handicapped by the general poverty and backward education of those amongst whom he works, he has done some good work through the year. In addition to English books and booklets, nearly 700 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font6"> in Xosa, which is the dialect most in use, have been placed in the hands of these “boys’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AUXILIARIES: There has been a monthly average of eight in the auxiliary work. These brethren, some of whom put in their ten hours a week in the Lord’s work in addition to their secular employment, have made 16,142 calls and have placed 8,186 books, of which 41 percent were bound volumes. Owing to the scattered nature of the territory in some of the towns, the auxiliaries have frequently to spend nearly ten hours in traveling in addition to their ten hours of actual canvassing. Their zeal is commendable, and they are Betting a good example to the other class workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CLASSES: Several new classes have been organized during the year. Actually, the average number of weekly workers in the classes has dropped from 51 to 47; but when it is remembered that the auxiliaries and additional colporteurs were recruited from the classes it will be recognized that there has been an all-round improvement both in the total number of workers and in the number of calls made. The class workers have made 61,857 calls and distributed 103,979 books and booklets. The distribution of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend </span><span class="font6">booklet was done largely by the class workers who put forth a good effort to get the booklet in the hands of all. In order that the important message contained therein might reach all corners of this vast land, the post was again used extensively and the friends cooperated loyally in helping to bear the cost of the work. That the Lord’s blessing rested upon the effort was abundantly proven by the large number of orders that came into the office for the books advertised in the booklet. The two IBSA weeks were used to honor the name of Jehovah; and to all who put forth the special effort, they were the two happiest weeks of the year. The results showed that there are more than 100 brethren who take part in the service, or nearly twice the average number of weekly workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Cape Town class continues to give a good lead to the remainder of the country. It does one’s heart good to seo the team here, full of vigor, and eager for the fray, swing out into action each week-end, whatever the weather conditions may be. In addition to the work amongst the Europeans, a very considerable number of books have been placed with the Cape coloreds and Asiatics, of whom there are many in this part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now eight interested ones regularly reading the prayer meeting texts and comments and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> articles. Three of the booklets in Braille are also being read with appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS AND SERVICE LECTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are no brethren in this land giving all their time to either of the above branches of the service. Three brethren, however, spend some time in both phases of the work. In the former, 69 lectures were given; handbills were distributed to the number of 55,000; the attendance was 4,937, and books placed amounted to 1,050. In the latter, four trips were made and there was a total attendance of 1,819 at the 119 meetings which were held. A good work is being done by both these phases of activity, and we shall continue to carry on each as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the past twelve months letters received numbered 3,087; and 5,744 were sent out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before concluding this report I must tell you that the brethren in this land greatly appreciated your message to them and the lively interest you take in the work in this part of the field. We have not given up hope of one day seeing you in the flesh, and are patiently waiting for the day of larger and faster airships. The South African division of the Lord’s army is small in number, but it contains a goodly proportion of real fighters.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark295"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s anointed in West Africa with the zeal and spirit of the Master press the battle at the gate. The following excerpts are taken from the report of the brother in charge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank God for the privilege of sending you our report of the work for another year. The year just closed has been one of active service. The Lord has blessed the efforts of the brethren, when we take into consideration the financial depression this year, which was caused by the low prices offered to the farmers for their cocoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oppression</span><span class="font6"> was much appreciated; also the books </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font6"> Now with the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font6"> the field looks new, the prospect transporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From reports, the &quot;sore and great and strong sword’’ of the Lord (Isa. 27: 1) is playing havoc with the ecclesiastical wing of the Devil’s organization in these parts. Daily we are asking the Lord for strength to push the work until fulfilment of Isaiah 6: 11 and 26: 21, and Job 38: 22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 35 public lectures were held, with a total attendance of 9,800. Class meetings 260, with an attendance of 2,650. Letters received 380, and dispatched 290. The total number of books placed in the hands of the people by the colporteurs and class workers throughout Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gold Coast, and Nigeria aggregated 17,084; booklets 17,818; and over 1,700 given away. In addition, over 35,000 handbill* were distributed for advertising public lectures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark297"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The small division of the Lord's army in Argentina (South America) has steadily advanced. The work accomplished is small, to be sure, but there has been a decided increase during the past year. The activities are directed from Buenos Aires, and a small company of the Lord’s faithful engaged therein. Argentina has a cosmopolitan population, and it is necessary to handle the gospel in various languages. During the year the gospel of the kingdom has been preached by placing literature in the hands of the people in the following languages, to wit: Spanish, German, Italian, Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, English, Arabic, Armenian, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Greek, French, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, Lettish, Croatian, and Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The total number of books and booklets containing the witness to the name of Jehovah that have been placed in the hands of the people there is 12,298 volumes. In his report the brother says: ‘ ‘ This is all the work that could be done and was done under the circumstances. Of course it was much higher than last year, but it was not as much as we desired. God blessed us abundantly, and we will put forth greater efforts for the coming year, if possible.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark299"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark300"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society found it more advantageous to remove the office to Sydney. The Lord’s blessing has been upon the work, and he has manifested his approval upon this move. During the year there has been a decided increase of spreading the gospel message of the kingdom. By way of comparison, in 1928 the number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people was 285,927, whereas in 1929 the total number was 319,566, or an increase of 33,639. An average of 42 colporteurs has been maintained throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the Lord’s grace some few stations have been used to radiocast the truth. We had hoped to be able to build a station of our own there, but up to this time this has not seemed possible. The local manager reports a great increase of interest due to the service weeks, and that the brethren have joyfully undertaken this part of the work. Upon this point his report says: “Letters received from the various classes and workers all bear testimony to the joy of the Lord experienced during these special efforts; and since May, 1930, is a long way off, we are arranging for an Australian service week from November 16 to 24, which will be a most suitable time for this part of the field.” It is gratifying to note that the work in Australia still progresses, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark301"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark302"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the fiscal year the work in Austria has progressed under the blessing of the Lord. There are now twelve organized classes for the service work, and other groups of friends in the country that are consecrated. Of the organized classes 175 engaged in the active field service regularly, while the number exceeds that on special occasions. There are three colporteurs engaged in the service. We formerly had colporteurs there from Germany, but the authorities would not permit them to stay. Colporteurs have placed amongst the people in Austria 4,617 books and 9,039 booklets. Class workers have placed in the hands of the people 18,473 books and 137,654 booklets. The enemy induced the supreme court to interpret a law enacted in the eighteenth century which forbids the brethren from going from house to house and placing the literature. Now they leave the books with the people, who gladly pay for them. This money is acknowledged as for contributions. In this way many books have been placed. Four conventions have been held during the year, with an attendance of 800.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark303"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark304"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the year a depot was opened at Brussells. There are only a small number of consecrated ones in the land, but the work is now organized for service, and during the year these put out 436 books and 12,503 booklets. One convention has been held in Brussells during the year, attended by brethren of various languages. Some of these, unable to speak the language used in Belgium, went amongst the people with cards upon which was printed the canvass, and they were blessed with opportunities for placing a number of copies of the message of the kingdom in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work is better organized in Belgium now and gives prospect of a good result during the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark305"></a><span class="font7">Brazil has a large area to cover, and the company to do the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom is small. The result for the year, however, shows a decided advance over that of the previous year. From the report of the local manager the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s work is yet new in Brazil. This country is large. Its ground is full and covered with unimproved natural richness -and beauty. Its people are poor and unlearned in a great part, but they are of good will and are desirous of better things. Its politicians misrule, deceive, rob, and oppress these good people. The foreign corporations living here are not always helpers, but robbers of the people. Big business is as elsewhere. The clergymen, or preachers, complete the Devil’s work by misleading the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am very glad to submit you this report; it is better than that for last year, but I am in firm hope or belief that for the next year it will be considerably better, because these trips or visits to different cities or stations are of great importance, as much in the proclamation of the truth by voice as by printed matter, which is more efficient amongst the people that can read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The local manager further reports that the clergy make every effort possible to thwart the work, but the Lord sees to it that it goes steadily on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has placed a printing press at the branch office in Brazil, and on this is printed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> in the Portuguese language, and also a number of the booklets for the benefit of the people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty consecrated are engaged in the field service work, going from house to house on Sundays and in such hours in the week days that they may find time. A brief resume of the work follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font7"> booklets dispatched, 5,770; other books and booklets, 6,442; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font7"> booklet, 3,930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren in Brazil are very zealous for the Lord, and are putting forth their best endeavors to his glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark306"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark307"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s anointed in Britain this year have made a splendid record. Many obstacles must be met by them and overcome. In the spirit of the Lord they do this, and with increased zeal and joy they are pressing on. The local manager of the British Branch sybmits the following, which well covers the situation in that land:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have pleasure in sending the report of the work of the British Branch for the fiscal year just ended. The year has been one of sustained activity throughout the British field. All parts of Great Britain have been well covered by the workers; and the same is true of the northern part of Ireland. The Irish Free State has had comparatively little done in it, not because of want of endeavor, but because religious prejudice and persecution by the Roman Catholic church has prevented work from being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total of books and booklets sent out from London during the twelve months is 2,312,640. Of these, 403,079 are bound books, and 1,909,561 are booklets. These figures, though large and very encouraging, fall short of last year’s total by 183,509. This great work has been accomplished by a people of limited means, both as to money and in the general conveniences of life. It has been accomplished because there has been a deep love for Jehovah, and a set purpose to do his will. The brethren have realized the privilege of serving Jehovah as a people compacted together. This has been brought about through the knowledge of the Lord, that is, through the instruction which he has sent to his consecrated people, and by an ever growing clarity of vision concerning the purpose of Jehovah in gathering a people together at this time. In loyalty manifested both in purpose to work and particularly in taking direction as to how that work should be done, the witness has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our records show that no less than 6,821,879 calls have been made upon the people in their homes. While it is true that many of these calls will have been made at the same homes, yet diffused it represents the fact that almost every home in these countries has been visited by some one representing the Lord and has had a witness about the coming of his kingdom. It is a pleasure to report that there is a growing unity amongst the brethren, and a growing spirit of set purpose to serve the Lord with one heart and one mind, taking the leading for that work which God has given through the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the greater portion of work done in placing the books in the hands of the people has been done through the class service work. Nearly all the classes in this field are now organized for service work. Of the whole number, 373 have reported under the organization method, and the number of permit holders or registered workers is 5,643. These brethren have made 5,286,225 calls during the year, the result in literature placed being 193,777 bound books and 1,622,917 booklets. I wish that we could report that every class in this field, however small, was organized for service. There are still some classes which do not realize, and therefore have not taken up, their privilege of service. In some cases no doubt, it is because they feel themselves too small to organize; but in others a different motive has prompted these little companies of brethren to refrain from joining with their brethren that they might act as one unit throughout the length and breadth of the land. The continual exhortations to unity of heart and mind which have been given in the columns of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> should have had the effect by now of causing that unity to be effected. We believe that very soon every loyal heart will be found in fullest union with the church of God throughout the earth. The freedom that is thought to be gained by refraining from organization always proves to be a myth: those who seek their own way find self a harder master than the bond service in which the truly consecrated realize the liberty of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Sunday morning service has been found to be the most productive of all the hours of the week. There are more men on Sunday mornings to whom the witness can be given and the word of truth spoken, and frequently these will have the message when the woman of the house would be indisposed to do so. This Sunday service, therefore, has been found not only the best time, but the best method of preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and of giving a witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can be none of the brethren who have enjoyed the service more than the Bethel family. The privilege which you gave us of using Saturdays for this work is highly appreciated and has been eagerly taken up. The total number of calls made during the year is 31,422. This is not so large as last year, but the total of books and booklets placed is 14,132, an increase of 534 on last year’s figures. The family here are very grateful that this privilege of service can be continued to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPORTEUR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As with the service work, so with the colporteur work, the report is good. The average number of colporteurs during the year is 215, with 70 brethren auxiliaries. Of this number, 15 full-time colporteurs have worked in Ireland, and 34 in Scotland helped out there by 12 auxiliaries, and the others have found their work in England and Wales. Some of the full-time colporteurs in England have been all the year canvassing the business houses in the towns and cities, with a very fair measure of success. The total number of books and booklets put out by the colporteurs is 460,015. Of this number 174,172 are bound books, while the remainder 285,843 are booklets. These figures do not reach up to last year’s good total of 503,381, but that is not because of lack on the part of the dear brethren, but because some of our most able brothers have left the country for other fields of service under your direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The special canvass of the business portions of the towns and cities still calls for workers. It is one of the most profitable of the services in the financial aspect, that is, there is little expense of traveling, and those who have ability have fine opportunities in the business houses of the cities. These are men who can not be reached in the ordinary way of canvassing. When they are at home the colporteur has little chance of getting near to them, but they are comparatively easy to reach in their offices in the city and are invariably ready to listen to the colporteur, and often are sympathetic toward him. This is a tight island, especially in the English counties. There are no large open fields here such as are to be found in other parts of the world, and the colporteur territory has to be very closely confined within certain areas. It follows that the canvass of the towns proffers the best field for service, both as to places for work and results to be gained from the work. We shall be very glad to have a number of young men willing to take and desirous of taking up this opportunity of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I should like to put on record some of the noble service done by the brethren as they go in the country places witnessing for the Lord, giving their whole time to that work. The Lord surely looks with great favor upon these dear workers, most of them sisters, who day by day, and often long hours in the day, seek thus to glorify the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTOR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have now no pilgrim service: the brethren who were engaged in it are doing far better work in exhorting the brethren to and in sharing with them in the one great thing which the Lord has put in the hands of his people. It is the pleasure and privilege of the regional directors not only to direct the brethren to the best method of doing the work, but to go with them into the field. Those brethren who are not alive to their privileges do not know what they miss in their failure to have these brethren amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 7 regional directors in Britain and northern Ireland. During the twelve montlis these have made 1,048 visits, with an attendance of 23,535, and have themselves placed 8,657 books and booklets. In visiting the classes they have traveled 17,791 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the many things for which the Lord should be thanked is this freedom from so much preaching about things which have little to do with the one thing needful. The Bethel brethren go out as usual to visit the classes on Sundays in the neighborhood of London, but they know now to confine themselves to the things written: they make no attempt to speak of things not yet given to the church through the appointed channel. Thus their message is one always bearing on the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel brethren have made 298 visits, with 6,484 persons at the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding feature of this year in this part of the field was your visit, and the three conventions which were held during your visit. The British brethren have come to look for a yearly visit from you, and because you were not able to come last year your coming this year was a special time to us. Without question the gatherings were blessed of Jehovah. At the three conventions, in the time allocated for service work, there were 3,070 brethren who took part, placing 15,861 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are days made trying to many of the faithful servants of Jehovah by reason of hardships in finding the things necessary for the responsibilities of life. Also the Devil presses hard upon those who seek the glory of God. Your coming and your presence in this part of the world for a while made the brethren feel that the distances over the seas were not so great after all, and made them realize the bond of a living union much more vividly. The first meeting in London at the Queen’s Hall soon after your arrival seemed to be specially blessed of the Lord, for the brethren were much quickened in spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been very little done in this phase of the work. The country witness work was finally closed down in July. The last effort was made in Ireland. That phase of the work seems to have spent its force. The public meetings which were held while you were here at the Koyal Albert Hall in London and the great Kelvin Hall Auditorium in Glasgow undoubtedly were a great service to us. The publicity which was gained through the newspapers gave, and continues to give, a link with the service worker and the person upon whom he calls; for, owing to the wide publicity which was gained, almost every one heard of the meetings you addressed at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the same time it had to be noticed that our efforts only confirmed what is seen both inside the Lord’s work and outside in political and other work, namely, that people do not now go so readily to hear a lecture as once was the case. This emphasizes to us all the more definitely that the Lord’s way to give a witness is by taking it to the people in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In conclusion, it is a great joy to me to see the growing unity of the faithful brethren in Great Britain, and with it, as is to be expected, the sense of responsibility of the high privilege of service to which the Lord has called his people, we sharing with all the faithful brethren everywhere. There has never been a time when the brethren here have been </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo </span><span class="font6">much of one heart and one mind in purpose to serve the Lord through his appointed channel and to do his work aS directed, and I am confident I speak for the British brethren one and all in giving expression of thankfulness for your own service, and in praying the Lord’s blessing upon you in your endeavor to serve the Lord and his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark308"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The report for the year from British Guiana is briefly summarized from that submitted by the local manager as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once more we gratefully place on record our appreciation of the Father’s blessings during the past year. As individuals, these are “too numerous to mention’’; as a little band of consecrated ones, who, with hearts full of love and devotion to him, look forward to an eternity of service in our King’s employ (and who can think of no better way of qualifying for such a position than by continual practice this side of the vail!), we are much encouraged as we look backward at the way in which the Lord has guided and protected us from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The period under review was most unfavorable to regular service, with heavy rains and a steady increase in financial stringency, but we managed to put out 1 book more than in 1928, the total being 5,333, as against 5,332!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On two occasions canvassing parties visited the county of Berbice, and put out 329 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Reconciliation,</span><span class="font6"> 300 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font6"> and 634 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to this, a systematic canvass of the distant parts of the colony was undertaken by a very zealous brother, who visited some localities hitherto untouched by service workers. At great personal inconvenience, and sometimes actual danger (crossing waterfalls, etc.), traveling for days in small open boats on treacherous rivers with a blistering sun overhead, tramping for miles along narrow paths flanked with dense tropical undergrowth, but with a joyful heart, this brother has delivered the message in the diamond and gold mining districts of the Potaro and Mazaruni rivers (on the fringe of the Guiana Forest), the timber grants of the Pomeroon (all “off the beaten track’’), as well as working the upper reaches of the Demerara and Essequibo rivers, putting out in such places 1,000 books and 500 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The regular workers have been “on the job” in the city and nearby villages as often as possible, and we are all so pleased that the Father continues to use us to magnify his name in some small way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font6"> is surely going to have a splendid reception at the hands of the public when we use it in the regular campaign, for 200 have been placed since we received it three weeks ago! It is a wonderful book, and we praise the L&gt;ord for the preparation and publication of such a witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark310"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark311"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The fiscal year comes to a close in Canada with a record of the most far-reaching witness yet given in that land. The anointed give thanks to God therefor. Having in mind the vast territory to cover and the number to do the work, the results show that only by the grace of the Lord could such be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following excerpts from the report of the local manager at Toronto, Canada, will be read with great interest by all the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witnessing work, in harmony with our Lord’s command, has gone on unceasingly throughout the year, and the loyalty and faithfulness of the friends, despite much opposition, is truly highly commendable and beyond question well pleasing unto the Lord. From the standpoint of books and booklets placed, the result is very gratifying, the total number being 795,391, which is an increase of 100,582 over the last fiscal year. Of this total, 193,409 were bound volumes, an increase of 79,965 as compared with 1928. When we take into consideration the population of this country and the fact that it is so far-flung, the result is very encouraging, for it means that a book or booklet has been placed with an average of one out of every 12.3 of the population. Further, when considering this result it is proper to take into consideration also the fact that almost two months of the workers’ time were occupied in four distributions of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font6"> totaling a circulation of some two million pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">COLPORTEURS: At the height of the year’s activities there were 104 colporteurs engaged in the field, and a large portion of the results accomplished has been accounted for by this little army of faithful, zealous workers. Of those who continued the full year in the service, 75 percent surpassed their objectives, while the other 25 percent did not attain to theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HOUSE-CARS: The house-cars, manned by one appointee of the Society and holiday workers from the classes, placed 68,216 books and booklets; and inasmuch as this service is almost entirely carried on in outlying, scattered territory, the results have been excellent. Not only has this service been used as an. instrument to make a far-reaching witness, but, being closely associated with the class activities, it has strengthened the morale of the classes and has given them an increased measure of the joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">NEWFOUNDLAND: The work in Newfoundland has been done during that portion of the year when the ocean to the north has been free of ice, and has been done with the boat. There has been a great deal of opposition and very much indeed to contend with in many ways in that land, but results are considerably in excess of those of last year. It has been found that to make the witness in that country is somewhat an expensive matter and requires the financial support of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brother in charge of the boat and its work reports: “We have found many people eager to listen to the truth, and manifestly the kingdom message has brought comfort to the hearts of the honest. The people of Newfoundland are much under the hand of the oppressor, and many have listened with tears in their eyes as we told them of God’s wonderfid kingdom where there shall be none to make them afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ During the past month we were held up a number of times by the dense fogs and high winds that so often hamper navigation on these shores, so that considerable time was lost Several times we nearly crashed into icebergs or ran ashore on rocks, but were always spared, as it were in the nick of time. Though we were held up by fog, wind, and other difficulties, so that often only one of us was able to canvass at a time, yet by the Lord’s grace we were able to place a total of 1,502 books and booklets. While landing at one place we were greeted with the query: ‘Are you the false preachers 1’ Our presence is known all along the coast; our arrival and departure generally hum over the telegraph wires. At some places we are met with open welcome, while others greet us with undisguised suspicion. However, the people are eager to hear the kingdom message, and it is a great privilege to place the truth with them. Our ship is certainly a trim little vessel and arouses the admiration of friend and foe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CONVENTIONS: During the year 38 service conventions were held among the English-speaking brethren from coast to coast, and six among the foreign-speaking brethren, embodying, all told, 122 drives, as a result of which 21,431 books and booklets were placed. These conventions were a marked contrast to the old-style convention, and were attended by earnest, faithful brethren all awakened to the fact that a Christian is a worker anointed to give testimony that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, that the result of his kingdom will be the vindication of God’s holy name, the triumph of his Christ, and the downfall of the forces of Satan never to rise again; the deliverance of mankind from oppression, and the opening of the highway to life to all who will faithfully seek to do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">RADIO: So far as the operation of the stations built by the Society in Canada is concerned, no change has taken place. The long-waited-for report of the radio commission appointed by the government has just been presented, and it appears that nothing will be done, not only in regard to our own stations but also the many applications for licenses in the hands of the government, until that report has been considered and a definite policy determined upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While our four stations have been silent during the year, the radio has not been silent in Canada; for we have used thirteen radio stations from coast to coast and one in St. John’s, Newfoundland. The majority of these have broadcast regular weekly programs, but others have been less frequent. Then too, we have been blessed with having a number of these stations tied in to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font6"> hook-up, and it would appear that the interest of many radio fans in the Lord’s message has been awakened by reason of the government’s action and our nation-wide campaign. So I question very much if the actual radio witness has been very much curtailed by the government’s action. Then further, while on the whole the programs of the Society in this land have been good, they do not compare with the chain broadcast from WJBBR at Brooklyn, the key station. Many are the expressions of appreciation of these programs, and our hope is that that network will yet be increased considerably in this country. Certainly a program coming from New York comes forth with much greater weight and influence than one originating in this country, and particularly is this true when you are announced as the one to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS: Everywhere we find the classes more whole-heartedly cooperating in the service work. Everywhere the elders are awakening, in fact have awakened, to the fact that the chief work of the church this side of the vail is to make the witness the Lord has determined for this our day and that the most effective method of that service, so far as the great bulk of the church is concerned, is the canvassing work. As a consequence, not only are they today whole-heartedly behind the service committee, but they themselves are out setting an example to the flock, and I can not help but feel that the Lord is blessing them and will continue to bless them as they thus serve. This oneness in the church from coast to coast is no doubt mainly due to the articles of encouragement and instruction as contained in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> the services of the regional service directors, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> etc. During the year the regional service directors have been very faithfully and energetically ministering unto the classes, occupying their time largely in the direct field service, setting aside the evenings for admonition and general discussion of ways and means to more effectively carry on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">UKRAINIAN: In accord with your instructions a Ukrainian office was opened in Winnipeg, with Brother Zarysky in charge, and a house obtained for the joint purpose of his residence and office. The result is that the work among these people is being well organized and a foundation is laid for a good witness. Having here a Falcon press not in use which Brother Zarysky felt he could use to advantage and which he himself could operate, we shipped it to him and it is now being used for printing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> and for general service work there. The reports at hand from the Ukrainian people express much appreciation of the fact that the office has been opened, and it is very manifest that much greater cooperation is now being obtained in the witness than heretofore. The Lord appears to be blessing the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FRENCH: The campaign among the French-spea</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font6">g people in Quebec and northern New Brunswick has been carried on very energetically during the year and an excellent witness given. There has been, as usual, opposition by the clergy class and the civil powers, but this has been reduced considerably as compared with former years. We have had only three cases to contend with, two of which were withdrawn and one in an outlying village upon a technicality resulted in a $10 fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blessed indeed is the portion of any one who has any share in this glorious work of the kingdom. More and more the Lord’s people in this land as elsewhere are realizing the fact that it is a wonderful privilege and that faithfulness in laying hold upon the privilege results in the peace of God that passeth all human understanding and brings an ever-increasing measure of the joy of the Lord. Oh, the blessedness of him who has waited until this our day! Greatly do all the anointed appreciate the light flashing forth from the temple, as conveyed to them through the columns of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> and sweet indeed is the fellowship of those who “walk in the light, as he is in the light’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As I meet with the friends in all parts of this land from time to time they lovingly inquire after you and express the desire that their love and greetings should be conveyed to you. Happy indeed am I to tell them of your faithfulness and untiring zeal in the interests of the kingdom work and to convey to you their love. They continually inquire, “When can we hope for a visit from Brother Rutherford again?’’ While I know you have much to do, a visit by you to Canada would be greatly appreciated by the friends, and I extend to you on behalf of them a whole-hearted invitation to this country and assure you of a warm and enthusiastic welcome everywhere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark312"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark313"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While the work has made some progress in Czechoslovakia, the scope thereof is not great. It is estimated that 80 percent of the population are illiterate, and especially ignorant with reference to the Bible. This is doubtless due to the fact that it has long been under the domination of the Roman priests. Living conditions are bad, money is scarce, and the people that can read have difficulty in providing themselves with reading matter. There are 12 colporteurs in the district. These have gone over chiefly from Germany, including some of the service department, to aid in organizing and starting the work in that land. There have been public meetings, and the Photo Drama has been shown. There have been readings from various books of our literature, for the benefit of those who ean not read. There seems to be a good means for laying a foundation for greater work. An epitome of the work accomplished is here set forth:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark330"></a><span class="font7">The Central European office is located at Berne, Switzerland, and has supervision over the countries of Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Poland, and Yugoslavia, and the report in these various countries last mentioned will be found under these headings. At Berne, Switzerland, the Society has one of its printing plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manager of the Central European office in transmitting the report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has done great things for us. Your heart and the hearts of the Lord’s people throughout the earth will surely be filled with joy as they read and hear the evidences that God is standing in the congregation of the mighty and that he is leading the forces of righteousness onward to certain victory. The Lord God has been our sun and our shield, he has manifested his grace and glory through his organization, and he has not withheld good things from them that walk uprightly.—Ps. 84: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your visit this summer, and the convention at Zurich with your presence, is one of the good things the Lord gave us during the past year. The convention was held May 11 to 13 and was attended by 1,400 friends gathered from every part of Switzerland, Alsace-Lorraine, Saar Basin, southern Germany, Holland, and America. The purpose of this and all other Smaller conventions during the year was that the anointed might receive practical instructions in the interest of their calling as Jehovah’s witnesses. On Saturday forenoon about all the friends then present, namely about 600 brethren, participated in the service work and placed more than 5,000 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your discourse on Isaiah 58 showed clearly that the cold and the lame, the doubting and the fearful ones, still have an opportunity to get right and to receive the Lord </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’b</span><span class="font6"> approval. All were much encouraged as we realized the Lord’s approval upon the course and the work of the Society by the visible manifestation of his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was good for us all to observe your courage, your faith, and your readiness to speak in order that you may be refreshed yourself and not in order to get the approval of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public witness you gave at Berne was well attended. The “Capitol” theatre was quickly filled and many had to be turned away. One person who could not find a place said: “I must hear this man!” She went and brought her own ehair and forced her way into the auditorium. Among the listeners were some well known business men and representatives of the embassies at Berne. Eleven hundred people attended and obtained 500 books and booklets, and many said this was the best lecture they had ever heard at Berne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the friends would have appreciated to meet you personally, and very often the friends throughout this part of the field ask me to convey to you their love. Frequently classes throughout the country asked me to tell you that they are with you in the battle, but I do not have the time to give, nor you to receive, all these expressions of loyalty and confidence; therefore I am loading thia report with the whole cargo at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our work at this office is properly divided into three parts: (1) The manufacturing of the literature here at the factory at Berne and the care of the Bethel home. (2) The service work for Switzerland. (3) The supervision of the work in the following countries: France, including Alsace-Lorraine and the Sarre Basin, France Polish work, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Poland, Italy, and Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now 35 members of the Bethel family at Berne, and I am pleased to report that the brethren are working diligently and each one in his place. In order to protect ourselves against the influence of the adversary, who is ever ready to disturb the unity of God’s people, we have framed a very beautiful and sweet motto, which is hanging in the dining room and which reads in large letters: “Study to be quiet and mind your own business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Amongst the wonderful things received we must mention that you gave us authority to buy a new machine for the stereotype room, a new fast press for the printing shop, and also a picture-making machine and all the equipment necessary for a new department, a chemigraphy. These machines have been installed and work satisfactorily. Concerning the chemigraphy we must tell you that so-called experts and other worldly concerns laughed at the idea, thinking that we could not do this work without men especially equipped for this work. A number of professions are united in this, and it was necessary to get some instructors to teach our boys. Ordinarily this profession requires an apprenticeship of three to four years. They have begun to make the cuts for the pictures for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and for the books. Our instructors were very much astonished to observe the willingness, diligence, and zeal of our brethren in applying themselves to their new task. The brethren also saved money by making some of the equipment themselves. In fact, we ourselves have greatly increased the value of the garage building by making the necessary changes in fixtures, walls, etc. One expert seeing the place when it was finished said that while it is not the biggest, yet for its size it is probably the most ideal arrangement in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The factory here has printed in sixteen different languages; we have set the type, made mats, and printed the following literature:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books in paper cover &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80,006</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Comparing this output with last year’s, we have increased our total production by 673,202 pieces of literature. In other words, we have accomplished more without increasing our force materially; only two persons have been added. Most of this literature printed at our factory is produced for other countries. Before the end of the year the old literature will have been put out, and we are printing only what is required.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from our effort to produce more, better, and cheaper literature, the service work is our chief concern. There is not the least doubt in our minds that the Lord is proving our love and loyalty for him in this, that he wants us his people to make books and then put them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through joyful obedience the brethren here in our territory have distributed a total of 1,150,653 books and booklets. There are now in our territory 177 organized classes, 1,952 service workers, 53 full-time colporteurs, and 20 auxiliary colporteurs. This includes the countries under the jurisdiction of the Berne office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark331"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark332"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At Copenhagen, Denmark, is situated the Northern European office. The work in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, is supervised from that office. Each country has a local manager, and the reports of the countries mentioned will appear under their respective headings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the general report of the manager of the Northern European office the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout this year there has been a growing consciousness that we are up against the Devil and his organization. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">every land he shows his horns. All the time the fight grows stiffer, and the brethren find it requires more determination to keep on. It is, however, a grand fight to be in. In Esthonia, after much trouble we have obtained the use of the radio, and the clergy continue to gnaw their tongues for pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> campaign went well, but far more energy was needed than for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom.</span><span class="font6"> Of these, 475,000 were placed, and without a doubt the Devil hates that booklet’s going out, for it draws the issue so clearly and magnifies Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of colporteurs is 147 (including auxiliaries). Last year it was 146. However, greater experience has enabled them to put out 450,363 instead of 379,800, as last year. Six hundred eighty-six class workers were out each week, and disposed of 625,034, a few hundred more than last year. In all, 224 classes send in reports regularly in Northern Europe, but, of course, the majority are very small</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The May IBSA Week was disappointing, only 40,868 being spread by 1,257 workers. In September, however, we had the best result ever obtained here. Inspired by the summer conventions, and with new ammunition in Norway and Denmark in the shape of sets of eight, while in Sweden and Finland </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font6"> had come, 1,586 brethren joined the battle in fine fighting form. Sixteen thousand nine hundred seventy books, 73,549 booklets, 288 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> subscriptions, and 4,843 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> were put out, making a grand total of 95,650. We have never before had so many books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Oslo the director and his assistant were both ill, and other workers were sick. The brethren said: “What shall we do!” Immediately they answered: “We must push ourselves ! ’ ’ And they did. Tliirty-five workers were out, and they placed 2,047, including 68 sets of eight. In Helsingfors 92 workers put out 8,027, which was a particularly fine achievement. In Copenhagen 135 managed 8,240. In Denmark they have experienced but little trouble, and the books are more difficult to sell on that account. Four hundred eight workers in the “week” managed only 114 sets in Denmark, while 149 workers in Norway placed 210 sets. In the Baltic states 63 brethren placed 155,767 during the year, which compares well with 99,377 by 41 brethren last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August I attended conventions in Lithuania, Latvia, and Esthonia, and it was very encouraging to see the native brethren in each country going out in the work. These brethren came along as a result of meetings last year and of the colporteur work. In Riga there was a colporteurs’ meeting at the convention and the Lettish colporteurs were very enthusiastic. In Tallinn two sisters came from the country in shawls and one was heard to remark to the other, “These people are really Christians!” Very good work has been done by the English brethren in these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As ever, service bulks largely in all conventions arranged, and many one-day service conventions have also been held. We anticipate that the new organization method will help the work forward considerably and lay a solid foundation for its further increase. We have supplied the classes with very simple forms entailing a minimum of work and yet keeping the records efficiently. Like most people, the brethren hate all forms; but our God is a God of order and will have his work done in an orderly way. All the managers are helping the brethren to lay hold of the method as quickly as possible. The number of the brethren grows smaller, but the remnant do more work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We appreciate </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> and also the new books, and are particularly glad that the contents of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font6"> are now made available to a wider public. How we wish you were a linguist, Brother Rutherford, for then, after dictating the books in English, you eould continue in the other languages! That would save a tremendous lot of translation. English and American brethren little realize what a curse all this translation work is. We anathematize the Tower of Babel! We are grateful for all the help so liberally supplied by America. Without it the work here could not go forward as it does. Sometimes we wonder if the brethren here are fully alive to their responsibilities in striving to make the work more selfsupporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If it be at all possible, we should appreciate a visit to the Northern European capitals next year. Your presence would give a big impetus to the work in these lands.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark337"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTHONIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work is young in Esthonia, and the workers small in number, hut their zeal for the Lord is great. During the year there was a total output of 53,704 books and booklets, which is an increase of 150 percent over last year. This was all done under very adverse conditions. Regional service directors have been appointed in that district and have labored faithfully in the field to organize the little company of workers and to carry on the work. These brethren went up from England to aid in the work in that land. There are three languages spoken amongst the people, which makes it somewhat difficult. More of the Esthonian brethren are entering the work; also some Finnish brethren have gone into Esthonia to help. In the southeast part of Esthonia is a Russian settlement, and a goodly number of Russian books have been placed among these people during the year. Due to the poor traveling facilities the field workers have been required to do much walking, often going from twenty to forty kilometers a day in addition to their canvassing. Accommodations at night are not easily obtained, and often the brethren are compelled to sleep outdoors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A convention was held at Tallinn in August, and in addition to the local brethren about 80 of the brethren from Finland came over to assist. Five hundred twenty-eight books were placed among the people during the convention. The effect upon the Esthonian friends was very stimulating. During the IBSA Week there were 4,500 books and booklets placed with the people. A few public meetings have been held, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">sulting in placing 1,700 books with the attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to your instructions we held tenaciously to the radio authorities here in order to get permission to broadcast. We were repeatedly turned down on the ground that they were already broadcasting sufficient religious matter; but when they built the new and much more powerful station here, in response to your repeated inquiries they said they were ready to discuss the matter. After much talk and some disputation a contract for a year was finally signed, as authorized by you. This gives us the right to broadcast for thirty minutes every Sunday, and also to renew the contract for a further period of one year if we so wish. We praise the Lord for this wonderful new weapon which he has placed in our hands. Up to the present, twelve talks have been given, all in English, nine of which have been interpreted into Esthonian, two into Russian, and one into Finnish- Our talks have been well heard in Sweden and Finland. Before I left the radio studio after the Russian lecture, people were telephoning, thanking us for the lecture and asking for more lectures of a similar nature. We fully expect that in the winter we shall have a still greater number of regular listeners to our lectures. From the canvassing we find that the people are listening in and are interested in what we say.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Finland reports the best year ever in the service of the Lord there; also that the classes and the family are in good spiritual condition, pushing on with their work with much joy in the Lord. At the F</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font7">sh headquarters there are only twelve in the family, but aside from their office work they placed in the hands of the people during the year 20,403 books and 3,203 papers, and took 703 subscriptions to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> There have been 47 colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs in the field, and these have placed in the hands of the people 119,988 books and booklets. The regional service workers have done splendid work during the year, as shown by the results. One of the regional service directors, besides doing his work as such, individually placed in the hands of the people 5,461 books, besides taking a number of subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thirty-five service conventions have been held during the year, and this has been a real stimulus to the brethren. At the conventions 46 symbolized their consecration and the workers placed in the hands of the people 14,787 books. Both </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> show an increase in subscriptions for the year. Generally the work has shown a decided increase over the previous year. Quoting from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the many helping features during the year has been the new publications of the Society. The new books are of very great importance and are much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the local manager of Finland, Brother Harteva, who speaks also the Esperanto language, attended a convention of Esperantists at Budapest and there delivered a lecture. The result</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was that 1,073 books in Esperanto were placed in the hands of the people, and 55 in the Hungarian language.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark340"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark341"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is with real joy that we are able to report that the French people are awaking to their privilege of knowing about God’s kingdom. A depot or branch office has been opened in Paris during the year. From that office the work in France, amongst both the French and the Poles, is carried on. Following the World War many persons migrated from Poland to France. Among these quite a number came to a knowledge of the truth. They desired to witness not only to their own people but to the French, and the Lord has opened the way. From the report of the local manager the following excerpt is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have printed cards on which the purpose of the worker’s visit at the home is stated in French. Armed with this new weapon the Poles are working with wonderful success and from month to month are placing more French literature. In fact, it has been noted that brethren working with the card, though not able to speak the language of the people witnessed to, were more successful than those who speak the language and possibly talked too much. This method is now being used throughout our territory, and the workers go forth with various cards and thus are able to witness to all nations without knowing their respective languages. In some sections, where there is mining and industry, there are many foreigners, and these are very hungry for the truth. They often look through the bag the workers carry to pick out the “food” themselves, and always ask for more. The French brethren have caught the spirit of zeal from their Polish brethren and there has been an awakening amongst them, which is manifested by their testimonies and their effort in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your visit in Paris, when you opened the new branch office for the Society there, was a special help to the brethren, and they have not forgotten it. With your approval the office was moved from Strasbourg to Paris, and this step has been blessed by the Lord. Three brethren are working at the office, and two Polish district service directors are visiting the Polish classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Poles are anxious now to learn the proper methods of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">doing the Lord’s work, and the Lord is not withholding his blessings from them. One hundred fifteen Poles were baptized during the year, 70 brothers and 45 sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A special convention was held this fall at Lens. Two brothers of this office were also present. During the war the city of Lens was completely demolished, and it was taken and lost and retaken by the contending forces of the Devil’s organization. Now the city has been rebuilt, but the lessons of the war are not forgotten. Thousands of crosses are still bearing testimony to the cruelty of the Devil’s organization. Now the messengers of peace have called upon the people at Lens with the words of comfort and welfare for the people. Twelve hundred brethren were present at the convention, and 600 participated in the service and placed more than 5,000 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now 36 Polish classes in France, and 893 friends; and of these, 360 participate regularly in the service, and the Poles distributed during the past year 7,502 books and 109,276 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there are 31 other classes in France: 15 French classes, with 209 brethren; 12 German classes in Alsace-Lorraine, with 280 brethren; and four German classes, with 250 brethren, in the Sarre Basin, which is still under the French protectorate. Altogether there are in France 1,587 brethren, according to the Memorial reports, and 600 of these are regularly in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The result of their efforts is seen by the fact that 3,318 books and 148,964 booklets were put in the hands of the people by these classes, in addition to those placed by the Polish classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, there are 14 full-time colporteurs and 7 auxiliary colporteurs working in France. All of these colporteurs working in France are foreigners, i.e., not French; and yet with the Lord’s grace they have put out during the year 5,267 books and 61,926 booklets. A Danish couple from Denmark have entered into the colporteur service in France. They have bought a car and are very successful in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total of books and booklets distributed in France is as follows: books 16,087, booklets 320,166, making a total number of books and booklets distributed of 336,253.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One Italian brother from America is also working in Italian sections in France, and he reports some wonderful experiences from Nice, Marseilles, and the isle of Corsica. He is now working Lyon and St. Etienne. The Italians in Franco are also glad to get the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Altogether a larger measure of the Lord’s spirit has been poured out upon the Lord’s people in France. The output of the literature has been doubled during the last six months, and it is increasing every month. There is more liberty for our workers in France than anywhere else in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Correspondence received at the Faris office, 3,256; dispatched, 3,874.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a small broadcasting station at Strasbourg which the Lord has given us to use for him. It is a private station, and at a comparatively small cost we can use it once a week for one hour. The first lecture will be given in French, on October 13. French and German lectures will be given from this station, which can be heard in Alsace-Lorraine and surrounding territory. This work has been organized by this office, the speakers have been selected, and the articles in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> will be used for radio talks. This door was opened in answer to our prayers, and we believe that the Lord will open this door more widely in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the above-mentioned work there has been a witness work going on amongst the Armenians who reside in France. Eight public meetings have been held, with an attendance of 174, and twelve exhibitions of the Photo-Drama, with an attendance of 305. Seventy-seven class meetings have been held, with an attendance of 715. There have been placed in the hands of the people 472 books in Armenian, and 12 in Arabic.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark342"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark343"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has greatly blessed our brethren in Germany during the year. The work has increased over that of the previous years. The following excerpts are taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wonderful explanations given in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and the five new books have made our eyes open keenly, and the friends are able to have a clearer view of Jehovah’s will and, at the same time, the subtle methods of attack by the adversary. The Lord’s anointed in Germany are zealous and joyfuL Some have fallen away; and while there are fewer who claim to be in the truth today than in 1928, and th&quot; number of workers is less, the result of the work shows an increase of approximately 300 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1928, 178,000 bound books were placed in the hands of the people, while in 1929 there were more than five hundred thousand. Since the new organization method was put in operation in this country in July, there has been a great increase in the number of books put out. Under the old method an average of 30,000 books a month were placed with the people, but since that time the monthly output has been upwards of a hundred thousand bound volumes. During the first six weeks of the new organization method, 8,000 sets of five, and many smaller combinations, were placed. During the service week in May, 6,757 bound books and 133,176 booklets were put out; but during the second service week under the new organization method, the result was 91,652 bound volumes and 208,403 booklets. The results are beyond all expectations, and this is proof that obedient submission to instructions issued by the head office brings the blessing of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The classes organized for service in Germany number approximately 450; class workers, 9,000; colporteurs, 50; others who have made application to enter the colporteur service in 1930, 40 persons. Books disposed of: bound volumes, 501,256; booklets, 3,937,098.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has built and equipped a factory in Germany. During the year other new machines have been added. In 1928 the production of bound books was 391,000 volumes. In 1929 the production was 919,000 bound volumes. In addition to this, the factory produced 5,684,000 booklets, 7,879,000 copies of magazines, and 4,705,000 tracts, besides small printed matters. It will be remembered that Germany prints most of the bound books for Northern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following excerpt is from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That increased production, made necessary by the increased distribution, would not have been possible if the Lord had not caused the necessary steps to be taken. It was apparently overruled by Jehovah that last year you gave your agreement to the erection of the new printery and office, for it would not have been possible, of course, to furnish the quantities of books needed, under the old local conditions. We are thankful to the Lord, dear Brother Rutherford, that we at all times find a good understanding and also the necessary financial aid for purchase of new machines, etc., if submitting such matters to you. We feel heartily joined with you and all your dear co-workers and all the dear friends there and in every part of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year a very important decision was rendered by the courts which has favored the freedom of the Society in manufacturing and distributing literature. Notwithstanding this, however, many of the brethren continue to be arrested. During the year there were 1,694 cases brought against our brethren in the courts. There are 1,118 of these still pending. The legal department of the Society at the office has successfully handled 460 of these cases. The local manager further says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the special features of 1929 was the convention at Leipzig, which was surely </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> great encouragement for the consecrated ones in Germany, forming a clear manifestation of the fact that the consecrated ones are willing to perform their great task side by side with the Society and its president, appreciating their privilege of having part in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taking all together, dear Brother Rutherford, with thankfulness toward God it can be stated that the motto for 1929 was like a prophecy, for also in this land as everywhere upon the earth it was fulfilled: “I will sing praise to my God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An effort is being made in Germany to aid the blind. During the year the Society caused to be manufactured and bound 1,232 books for the blind. These, together with others in stock, were placed in the hands of the people on loan to the number of 4,080, and other parcels of literature to the number of 3,575. There are about 250 regular readers amongst the blind, 28 of whom are consecrated. In addition to this, about 100 more receive literature from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The German office also has supervision of the Society’s work in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and Luxemburg. A report of these appears in the proper place.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark344"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark345"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Greece has not advanced very greatly, because of the continued opposition by the state church. The brethren, however, are zealous, and organized, and continue to press the battle. The following excerpts are taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is with joy for the privilege from the Lord to serve him a year more, that I am writing this report. The enemy has tried this year to stop the work, but the Lord has blessed it, notwithstanding the enemy’s desperate efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As you know, here in Greece the clergy exercise much power because of the existing union of church and state, and they sent documents to the Office of the Interior as well as to the Office of Justice, and so the books of the brethren who were placing them in the hands of the people were repeatedly seized and committed to the Court of Common Pleas. These in turn declared the books free. I tried to send a petition to the government, but I met with different obstacles; but lately I sent a petition to the Office of the Interior as well as to the Office of Justice, and I am expecting favorable results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Twice this year agents came to me from the Office of Public Security and asked me to give them one of each book for examination, but they were returned to me again. I also was indicted to the public prosecutor as stirring up the Orthodox church, but some days ago the decision was favorable. I hope that in a few days we shall have the freedom of the work, for which we earnestly pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of this prohibition of the books, the work has not been so extended as we hoped it to be. Most of the classes are vigorous and zealous in proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, though some of them have not yet seen their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a colporteur in the field, and lately another one was added. They visit especially parts of Greece where the classes do not work, or where there are no classes. There were also three pilgrims in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the books placed in Greece we have not counted the many thousands sent from the Greek classes of America to classes or individuals here. According to my judgment, for many reasons, this has been to the detriment of the work in general It is true that there is much more to be done, and, by the grace of God, we shall all try to be faithful to the end, enjoying our great privilege to be a part of God’s organization.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark352"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark353"></a>HOLLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Holland during the year has been greatly blessed by the Lord. In the last five months of the fiscal year, an excess of 10,000 books and booklets over the number put out in the same period of time last year were placed in the hands of the people. There are six colporteurs regularly engaged in the work, and four auxiliaries. In addition thereto there are about forty active class workers. Classes are organized for the service, and the work is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elsewhere a good proportion of those who claim consecration do not see their privileges of active service. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people during the year was 58,287.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The local manager has the opportunity, from time to time, of broadcasting the truth by radio. During the year three service conventions were held. The forenoon of these conventions has been devoted to the field work, and the remainder of the day to class study and discourses. In addition to the work amongst the Dutch people in Holland, books have been placed in German, Polish, English and Slovenian. There are five brethren who participate in the serving of the classes on Sundays and particularly pointing out to them their privileges. Taken as a whole, the work in Holland has been quite satisfactory. Of course, we should be glad to see a continued increase if that be the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark354"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark355"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Very little work has been done in Hungary during the year. This is due to the influence of the enemy organization. All meetings are forbidden. No one is permitted to openly circulate the literature. Books have been confiscated when found in the homes of the brethren. The post office authorities often confiscate our literature, and those to whom sent have been arrested and brought into court. While strenuous efforts have been put forth to change the situation, there have been small results. The people are groaning under their load, and longing for freedom that the kingdom of God alone can bring them. Some of the zealous ones got a few crumbs of consolation to those who are hungering for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the following have been placed in the hands of the people: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font7"> 51;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font7"> 97; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font7"> 324; other books, 565; booklets, 1,789; copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> sent, 1,234; copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> 240; free tracts, 500; meetings held, 52, with attendance of 1,928. Meetings held in classes, 328, with a total attendance of 2,568. There are 29 classes organized and putting forth the best efforts they can to do some work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark356"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark357"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">India is a very large country with many people and much ignorance concerning the Word of God. Satan the enemy has well succeeded in blinding most that are there. It is God’s pleasure, however, to have some witness given. It is a real joy to report the increased amount of testimony given in India during the past year. The following is quoted from the report of the local manager in India:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once again we have been able to more than double our previous year’s output of books. At the begi</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nning</span><span class="font6"> of the year we were handicapped through lack of workers, there being only two full-time workers for English work. In January a brother, resident in India, volunteered for service, but we were overjoyed and grateful to you for sending out from England two brothers who joined us in March and again two more who arrived in the beginning of August, so that now there are seven of us and we are able to spread ourselves out over the country a little more evenly. There is still room for more, however. There are only four regular class workers (English).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The output of books last year was 20,150. This year the total is 48,662. This figure is made up as follows: English bound books, 11,094; booklets, 10,400; vernacular volumes, 1,141; booklets, 26,027; whilst 5,000 free tracts have been distributed. Six hundred and sixty-three public meetings have been held (138 English and 525 native), attended by 47,600 people (12,600 English and 35,000 native), for which 17,600 handbills were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There have been some interesting developments during the year. The first was in the use of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Photo-Drama of Creation </span><span class="font6">by means of lantern lectures. This has proved a very popular form of witnessing to the kingdom. Sometimes these have been given in English to English audiences, and sometimes through an interpreter to a purely Indian audience. Many of the mission fields have been visited and the pictures shown in the mission churches or schools. It must be borne in mind that the majority of these mission centers are little more than educational systems where poor, ignorant, outcast Indian children are given a primary education. Sometimes more elaborate institutions are managed, consisting of high schools and colleges, but the average missionary in India is more a social worker and educationist than a preacher. The preaching is done largely by native pastors and teachers. In these mission centers the whole Christian community live together in a &quot;compound”, or walled-in plot of ground, and the missionary is a sort of foster parent over them all. The Indian Christians are mostly a very simple sort of folk, drawn from the lowest classes. These lectures, therefore, have to be made as simple as possible; but it is through the lectures that the way is opened for us to get in close touch with the whole community and especially the more educated teachers, pastors, and the missionaries themselves, and this is where the more effective witness has been given. The vernacular booklets have been readily purchased by them and, we believe, have done a good work in pointing them to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year our activities were confined to places served by the railway systems of the country, and the use of a motor vehicle was seen to be advisable. In January you gave us permission to purchase a car, and a new model Ford van was bought and fitted up to carry the Drama outfit, books, and personal equipment for living independent of traveller's bungalows or hotels. This has been a great advantage to us. From February to September two brothers have travelled over 7,000 miles in this car, visiting places miles away from the railways as well as the larger cities served by the railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In last year’s report mention was made of an experiment with vernacular booklets among non-Christian co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:line-through;">mm</span><span class="font6">u</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:line-through;">ni</span><span class="font6">ties. This has now grown to be a regular feature of our work. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Distress</span><span class="font6"> booklet has been published during the year in Urdu, Marathi, Gujerati, and Tamil, whilst a condensed edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oppression</span><span class="font6"> has been printed in Bengali and Hindi, besides a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> article (“Truth”) in Tamil These vernacular booklets have made it possible to work in vast areas of the country where English is little known and where few white people live. About 5,000 of these booklets have been placed with non-Christians alone. Of course the more educated non-Christians have been canvassed with English bound books, and a good number placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In many of the Indian Christian communities there is evidence of an awakening. The Christian converts of India are mostly from illiterate and lowest classes of people, but among them are the thoughtful, educated ones, school teachers and social workers, etc. Many of these educated ones are beginning to see that orthodoxy has misled them, and there is a crying out for truth. We have had real encouragement in seeing a few earnest workers in these orthodox mission fields recognize the truth, and in some instances they have not been slow in giving expression to their feelings, with the result that there have been some animated scenes. In two instances we have received letters asking us to take over the supervision of the whole Christian community (which, of course, is impossible), Baying that the missionaries are not teaching them the truth. There is evidence of a harvest work beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of last year we were invited to contribute articles to a religious magazine published in the Kanarese language. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> have been running in serial form during the year, and this is now showing evidence of fruitage. We have several testimonies of appreciation from that source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Efforts to have further use of the radio have been unsuccessful. Broadcasting has not ‘caught on’ in India very wtJ. Comparatively few people own receiving sets, and the Indian Broadcasting Co. is faced with a struggle for existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dividing up our territory into its component parts: India, Burma and Ceylon, the work during the year has been confined chiefly to India. No colporteur has visited either Burma or Ceylon. There are one or two zealous class workers in Ceylon who have given a faithful witness, but the work in Burma is practically at a standstill. Arrangements are being made for a colporteur to visit Burma during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Travancore (a native state in the south of India) there is a zealous band of Indian workers. The work in this state has been organized several years and they are still ‘pressing the battle to the gate’. A second-hand car was provided for them during the year, and an old Drama set put in working order. They, too, have had much encouragement from this form of witnessing. Travancore is a state well saturated with orthodoxy, for it is the oldest mission field in India. The LBSA is well known down there and the opposition is very intense. The majority of the people are very poor, and the Christians absolutely under the heel of the missionaries, whilst the non-Christians are very much prejudiced against anything connected with the Bible. This makes the work in Travancore very difficult. Due to the pressure of the missionaries many of the people are afraid of even accepting a free tract. In spite of this opposition, however, the brethren in Travancore have succeeded in distributing a far greater number of booklets this year than at any other time. The output of bound volumes is slightly less than last year, but there is a great increase in the booklets. A very cheap edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font6"> was printed, and a considerable number of these have been disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five hundred twenty-five meetings were held during the year by the Travancore brethren, attended by about 35,000 people, whilst 836 class meetings were conducted, attended by about 12,000. A total of 19,062 books and booklets was disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outlook for the coming year is hopeful. With the additional workers (and we hope more will come) we should be able to make the name of Jehovah known over a wide area. We are realising more and more what our responsibilities are as ambassadors of Christ. Whilst the political and industrial situation of the country becomes more and more complicated, with ever increased wrangling between the Hindoo and Moslem in their efforts to cast off the British domination, discerning minds are beginning to see the hopelessness of world affairs, and it is to such that the message of truth must eventually prove itself of divine origin. We appreciate our privileges as ministers of reconciliation, and we are grateful to the Lord for the evident way in which he is using the Society to accomplish his “mighty acts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A letter to the president of the Society from the North Travancore Chermar Society office, recently received, expresses a keen desire for more information concerning God’s Word. From that letter the following quotation is taken: “We are the oldest race in the land of Karala, comprising Travancore and Cochin states in South India, now known by the name of Chennar Society, and are being treated as slaves by high castes even from the pre-historic period to the present era.... We happened to acquaint your South India secretary, Mr. A. J. Joseph, and by chance he presented for us some of your literature. We highly appreciate what it contains. We are anxious to adopt your method of teaching and work under your Society. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is really a cry for help, and by the Lord’s grace we are trying to do something for these people, who really want to know about the kingdom of Jehovah that will bring the blessings to mankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark358"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark359"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The enemy has seemed to succeed well in shutting the truth out of Italy. The books are no longer permitted to enter. Not even the Italian </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font7">can now be sent into Italy. The people cry for liberty and the truth, but the hand of oppression weighs heavily on them. Even though the barriers are put up, a few faithful brethren have placed in the hands of the people 328 books and 3,053 booklets. Many Italians have fled from the country and have gone into France and other places, and the Italian books are being placed in their hands in these countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark360"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The report from Jamaica is gratifying. The small number of brethren there have manifested their zeal and devotion to the Lord. The following excerpts are taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can truly say that the Lord’s hand has guided us in the work which has brought glory to his name and joy and gladness to all who have taken a delight in carrying out their part of the work under the present management. We have to express our gratitude to God for the way he has guided you in directing his work so that all who desire can have an active part therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year just closed has been one of special service to the classes here and much blessing has been received therefrom. Both service weeks have brought us rich blessings, as the efforts put forth by all were richly rewarded. Although the number engaged in the work during the year is less than that of the previous year, the work accomplished is greater. This proves that the Lord can carry on his work with even a few who are wholly devoted to his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By following the methods of the Society we find that there is always something to do, which is a source of great joy to all who are desirous of doing the Lord’s will. The active brethren are having the zeal which is peculiar to the Lord’s house, which accounts for the success of the work of the year just closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingston class has lost a very zealous service director and a few active workers who have all passed into their reward, but our loss does not affect the work in the least, as the work of that class progresses with vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year, I visited Cayman Brae, a small neighboring island, where the Kingdom message was given for a witness. Some books were left in the hands of the people for their further enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again we have to express our appreciation and gratitude for the rich food served us from time to time through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> also for the interest shown to the Jamaica Branch by the head office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The efforts are yet young in Japan and Korea. The work in these countries is managed from one office at Tokio. The Lord’s blessing has been upon it this year, especially in Japan. Results are gratifying, considering all conditions. The following excerpts are taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another glorious year has gone since I made last annual report to you. The year was such a wonderfully blessed one. Although a division was made among the friends, and about half of them went out of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">present truth,</span><span class="font6"> the result of the witnessing work was far better than that of the previous year. The victory is on the side of the Lord and his anointed, always. The faithful ones are greatly awakened in the service. They begin to have such a great joy in the house-to-house witness work. The colporteur department of the Japanese branch is well organized, and the brethren are wonderfully blessed by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Japan is Gentile country, and the people of Japan are very poor. They are disgusted with nominal churchianity. And still the Lord opened their heart for the truth, and many books were placed amongst them. The result of the activities in Japan, from September 25, 1928, to September 24, 1929, is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We made a good witness for the King and the kingdom in The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> published February 1, 1929. The manager of the Japanese Branch was arrested on the charge of violation of periodical act and was fined one hundred yen ($50). We appealed to the higher court. The defendant had good opportunity to give three lectures, once to the district attorney, and the other two to two judges. As the result of this the divine program of salvation, from Eden to restitution, was recorded at the courts which represent the Mikado of Japan. Everything was overruled wonderfully to his own glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dear faithful brethren are more rejoicing in the service. They look up to the kingdom with great joy, and at the same time they are wonderfully blessed in the performance of their own present duty at this special hour.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The local manager in Latvia begins his report with the statement, “This has been the very best year so far in the history of the work in this country. The Lord has blessed his people in their endeavors to give the kingdom witness. There has been much opposition, but this has spurred the friends to greater efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year 91,973 books and booklets were sent out, which was just about double last year’s figures. Four classes are organized. Thirteen colporteurs, pioneers, and auxiliaries are engaged in the work. The government forced the German colporteurs out, and this spurred the others of the local brethren to enter the field. The government there is much opposed to the truth, and has taken many steps to prevent its spread. The common people, however, manifest much joy of heart when they hear about the kingdom, and the colporteurs report that they frequently, both men and women, receive the message with tears of joy. Quoting further from the local brother’s report, &quot;All the opposition of the Devil and his organization here only spurs us on to be more faithful. It is a real joy to have a share in the work here at all, and we are determined to press on in the coming year and be faithful to all our privileges.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LITHUANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the local manager’s report the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Memelgebiet (formerly German, Lithuanian since 1922) the truth is of fairly old standing. Some have grown weary, but the remai</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font6">g ones are growing steadily in zeal and enthusiasm. They are governed by the former German code of laws, whereas the rest of Lithuania ia under the Russian; and, owing to this fact, it has been impossible for them to extend their activities to Lithuania proper, as they used to do. This accounts for the drop in output.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is almost impossible to approach any one in the Gebiet without being instantly recognized as a “ Bibelforscher Even the most remote country districts have been reached, the brethren going out for the whole day by motor bus, starting sometimes as early as 5: 30 a.m. On one occasion recently about 20 brethren disposed of 187 books and over 1,000 booklets. In view of all the circumstances, the results are very gratifying; the sale of bound books having risen from l^OO<sup>-</sup>to 1,771, and the circulation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> being increased by 78. A convention, attended by about 110 brethren, was held in Memel in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Lithuania proper there are many difficulties. The country is under a dictator and has been under martial law for about two years. For every single meeting, however small, a permit must be obtained from the war commandant, the prefect, and the chief of police. Owing also to the difficulties of finding suitable interpreters, and the poor means of traveling, we have not been able to hold many meetings or classes. This, of course, has impeded the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For canvassing, permits are necessary, and these are difficult to obtain. In some instances the officials arbitrarily refuse to issue any, and there is no redress. However, six brethren procured these and engaged in full-time pioneer work at different times during the year, averaging two for the whole year.

<p><a name="bookmark445"></a><span class="font7">Luxemburg is a decidedly Catholic country, small in population, and little enlightened on the Scriptures. Its laws are medieval. Canvassing for the books and literature is entirely forbidden, and very little could be done during the year. Two colporteurs have invaded this dark place and put out some books, the following being the results: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures, </span><span class="font7">56; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font7"> 120; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font7"> 182; other books, 71; booklets, 328.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The local manager of Norway, from whose report the following is taken, says: “The people have little money, but the trouble seems to open their ears more to listen to the message of the kingdom of God. We have sent out from this office a total of 111,677 books and booklets. We have but one regional service director, but all who can are zealously pushing the work.

<h2><a name="bookmark468"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark469"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren in Poland have passed through some very trying experiences. The enemy scattered a number of them for a time, but now, quoting the language of the local manager, “some of these are returning and working in harmony with the Society. ’ ’ The government made it impossible for the German brethren to go over and help the Poles, and therefore during the year the supervision of the Polish work was transferred to the Central European office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The number of organized classes is forty. In addition to these there are about forty other small groups unorganized for service but who have begun to be active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are thirty full-time colporteurs in the field in Poland. During the year the classes and colporteurs preached the gospel by putting in the hands of the people the following books and booklets: Polish, 254,404; Ukrainian, 14,518; German, 8,783; Russian, 4,298; other languages, 721 ■ making a total of 282,724.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special effort was made on “All Souls Day” (corresponding to the American Decoration Day). On that day the brethren went to the cemeteries and together distributed about seventeen thousand WAere </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Are the Deadf</span><span class="font7"> booklets. These brought many letters and orders for other literature to the office; a further evidence that there are many who mourn and who desire to be comforted, and who find comfort only in the Word of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A special blessing came to us as we set aside to each class a certain territory. More and more the brethren recognize that they are called, not to sit down with the Lord in the vineyard, but to work with </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6">; and that they were entrusted with the interests of the kingdom, of which they must give an account to the Lord. All of this inspires the hope that the next year will bring a much greater result because a healthy foundation for the work has been created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A special help to the colporteurs has been the kindness of the dear American brethren, for they have paid for 5,000 sets of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies</span><span class="font6"> and these have been sent to the colporteurs in Poland and have been given to them in order that they may hold out under difficult circumstances. Some colporteurs, on account of the bad conditions, had left the work; but they have now returned, and others have been added to the force. Now, we have 30 full-time colporteurs and some are getting ready to go out; and even in the southern part, the Ukrainian district, we now have workers where we had none before. These are telling of the great joy they have in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have not had much opposition from the government except in a certain district where the clergy have more influence, and there the effort was made to stop our work. This was in vain. Two archbishops gathered signatures and presented the petition to the authorities to forbid the distribution of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> in Poland. They even announced in their own church journals, in big type, that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> is now being swept out of Poland. They did not accomplish this, however; in fact, a university professor recommended </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> through the radio at Wilno, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">is increasing and will sweep out everything that opposes the light of the ‘ ‘ new and golden ’ ’ day. More and more the Lord increases our joy and gives us his visible protection. In the same manner a healthy spirit is increasing amongst the friends. Some false brethren must now be silent and their honor is their own shame. Some said foolishly, ‘We must make as many splits as there are posts in. the tabernacle in order that the kingdom might come.’ They thought it was their task to tear the Lord’s people apart, but the consecrated ones have found their place and now they are standing more firmly than ever in the battle line of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year two regional service directors were in the field, and even though this is one-third the number of pilgrims, much better results are shown. They have held public meetings, visited the classes, and instructed them and shown them their privilege of participating in the service. Five conventions have been held during the year. The correspondence has increased during the year. Letters and cards received numbered 4,847; dispatched, 4,451.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a pleasure to report that the work in Poland is in better condition at this time than it had been for some time past.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark470"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark471"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Portugal moves slowly. Many are illiterate; and a still greater number know little or nothing of the Bible, and they have not very much interest therein. There are some, however, who are hungering for the truth, and the faithful brethren have been making an effort to serve these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year 56 bound books and 1,619 booklets, or a total of 1,675, have been distributed amongst the people. Also 21,500 copies of tracts. In the last few months of the year a greater effort has been put forth in Porto, and the results have been better than in Lisbon. The local manager reports that some of the ministers have gotten hold of the truth and have seen some of their errors and changed their method of teaching the people, but they still do all they can to prevent the people from getting hold of the Society’s books or literature. The subscriptions to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> have increased during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark472"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark473"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Rumania is in even a worse condition. At the beginning of the year the German office had supervision there. Because of the unfaithfulness of the one whom the Society sent there, the friends have been scattered and their confidence greatly shaken. The Society has been watching for some opportunity to again revive the work in that land, but the local authorities forbid everything, and we must wait until the Lord opens a more favorable way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark474"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark475"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The little company of the Lord’s anointed continue to zealously and earnestly serve the Lord in the giving of the witness of the King and his kingdom in Spain. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am pleased to submit to you the annual report of the witness given in this land during the past year. I would first of all like to convey to you the love and gratitude of the brethren here for the generous help you have extended to us, both spiritual and material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Owing to this we have been enabled this year to install a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> press and to now print our own edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> in Spanish, exactly on the very month that celebrated the first publication of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> in Spain four years ago. We thank God for this from our hearts, as also for the timely spiritual food we are receiving from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> which helps us to keep strong and of good courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We would wish to give you a better report of the work, but progress is slow. We are surrounded by a host of difficulties and inconveniences which would exterminate the witness if they could; but the battle is the Lord’s, and in this knowledge we rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> printed in Spain is also sent to Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica, where there are a few Spaniards who are interested in the truth. Further the local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people listen gladly, and would make groups in the streets to listen if they were allowed. The police, however, soon disband them for fear of a revolt or revolution, which is what every one is in mortal fear of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the provinces 21 public conferences were given, in some parts one or two Protestant ministers lent their halls. In Malaga, the Episcopal minister said to the united audience composed of the congregants of four different denominations of that city who had been invited, “I have never heard the Bible so wonderfully explained as tonight, and what this man says is true. We are all asleep and what we need is more men like this amongst us.” He published an article of The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> in a Protestant paper, which he had to suppress because of a protest by the rest of the Protestants. And this same minister was severely called to order in August when the Protestants held a convention in Barcelona. The Baptists had a special meeting to agree on the extermination of the Bible Students who are ‘robbing sheep from their folds and filling the land with dangerous literature’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholics publish in their local papers a warning to their flocks of excommunication if they read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Saturnino Fernandez, in Barcelona, is giving the witness there. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ok</span><span class="font6"> Sundays he does a special work in a book fair. He places a stall there with all the Society’s publications. He is never seen alone. His stall is always surrounded with people, Protestants and Catholics alike, who go to discuss religion and be told the truth of God’s purposes. Sometimes his sales are good, but even when they are not he preaches a good many sermons during the morning. The Catalans are a studious people and advance well in the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemies’ fight is strong against the faith. We see this too in the personal experiences of those who begin in the way. Nevertheless we see how the Lord “keeps” those that are His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We see the people longing and looking for the solving of the problem of their miseries. They no longer expect it from their rulers or their spiritual directors. They hear the news of the kingdom for them, and they can believe it and accept, for, as they say, they have had enough of a God of torment; they begin to see the why and wherefore of their sufferings and tears, and they rejoice and praise God. Many there are who had lost all faith, and who are enjoying now the sunshine of God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year 21 public meetings have been held. Books disposed of to the number of 739; booklets, 4,107. New subscriptions to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font7"> 375; which brings </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> list up to 1,450 in Spain, with about 2,000 subscribers living outside of Spain.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark476"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark477"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord still continues to bless the work in Sweden. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year now passed we have had the joy of seeing the friends taking part in the service work with a determination and zeal as perhaps never before, and more of them out, too, in spite of the fact that our number at the Memorial is decreasing. Including the colporteurs (pioneers) and auxiliary colporteurs, of whom we have had an average number each month of 27 and 23, respectively, there has been an average number of 241 workers in the field week by week. The colporteurs have placed a total of 124,510 books and booklets; the service workers, 187,879. Including what has been distributed directly from the office, at conventions, and at public meetings, there have been actually placed in the hands of the people 324,553 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year we have been somewhat hindered by the unusually strong winter, which in some parts practically paralyzed all traffic for several weeks and caused much delay and trouble in many ways. This time it did especially affect the southern parts of the country, where the people are not so accustomed to the cold and snow as in the northern parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main feature of the year was Creation, which appeared in Swedish just on time for IBSA Week. It was during the latter part of the year, but still became the main feature, because we had been waiting for it so eagerly; and it went remarkably quick. The first shipment from Magdeburg was put out from the office in less than three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> campaign was also much appreciated. We found that the public was not quite so ready to buy this booklet as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font6"> last year, so they had to be more persuaded. But, on the other hand, those who read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> seem to have been more impressed and more encouraged to take a stand for the message the booklet brought. Many people wrote in to the office for lots to spread among their friends and neighbors, and that both twice and thrice. Surely the issue has become more and more clear to all order-loving people, all who really love the Lord, even if they have not known him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> is showing a healthy increase, as you will see by the figures 14,014 subscribers, as against 11,832 last year. We try to deal with matters of topical interest to the public in this country, and so give them the right viewpoint. And often we get encouraging reports as to how the subscribers appreciate the message and talk to others about it and readily take the books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark482"></a><span class="font7">Switzerland, small in area, small in population, and still smaller in workers in the Lord’s vineyard, has increased its work during the year. A large number of samples of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> were put out during the year, and 1,500 subscriptions resulted. Six hundred twenty-five brethren have participated in the service work, and have placed 10,195 books and 255,671 booklets; while five auxiliary colporteurs placed 2,370 books and 8,999 booklets. With the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font7">distribution added, this makes a total of 313,235 pieces of literature. For some time only each alternate Sunday was used for service, but now the classes employ every Sunday, and as much time during the week as possible. For some time it was difficult to place books in Switzerland. The governmental authorities, incited by the priests, prevented the placing of books in the hands of the people and taking money therefor. But court decisions have recently favored the workers, and in three counties or cantons the brethren may now place the books at a fixed price. About 20 cases have been before the courts, and these have resulted in favor of the Society; and thus the work has been encouraged. The clergy have induced police authorities of the land to make many arrests, but the Lord has delivered the brethren and the work has gone grandly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently 106 brethren concentrated their efforts one Sunday on the canton of Valais, one of the strong-cst Catholic communities in Switzerland. “One group traveled with the night train leaving Sunday morning at 2 a.m. in order to be in time on the fighting line. At nine o’clock sharp the battle began. The line of the attack covered 120 kilometers, the entire Rhone valley. The result was the distribution of 4,000 booklets within four hours and a half. The battle was nearly finished when the organization of the Devil acted and caused four brethren to be taken to prison. The case was handled in court. The brethren were released, and the police, wholly Catholic, were told to restore the literature which they had confiscated. This was a big success and encouraged the brethren for a second offensive. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The members of the Bethel family at Berne have put forth strenuous and joyous effort. The family is small, being of only 23 members, yet they placed during the service week 2,200 books and booklets, and their efforts during the year totaled 20,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One large convention was held during the year, attended by 1,400. Six hundred of these participated in the service, with 5,000 booklets placed in the hands of the people as the result. Fifteen public meetings were held during the year; and 765 class meetings, with an attendance of 20,152 friends. During the year 32 brethren have served as auxiliary district service directors in organizing the work in a better manner. The new method of district organization was recently put in operation in Switzerland, and the results thus far have received the blessing of the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark483"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark484"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brethren in Trinidad, small in number but zealous for the Lord, have been active during the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">year. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is our privilege to report another year of joyful service, including activity in reaching distant parts. We give some figures below:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark485"><span class="font6">Number of class meetings</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">Attendance at same &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29,985</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Booklets sent out &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,069</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark489"><span class="font6">Conventions, 5 of eight days; attendance</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of meetings is larger than were held during the previous year, but the attendance less, thus showing a remnant; and that the studies make clear to them the Lord’s will that the good news that the kingdom is being established must be preached is shown in that the output of bound volumes (which so grandly give the message) increased by 48 percent. Booklets show a decrease of 8 percent, but are yet nearly three times as many as went out during 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above figures are also in harmony with the fact that most of those who read the wonderful </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and attend the studies are appreciative of the Lord’s gracious provision and of his will, which they realize to be not only attendance at meetings, but that service means work; and so the term “serving the Lord” means doing the work which he requires to be done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark490"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark491"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Yugoslavia is not great; but there are a few zealous brethren, and the Lord has blessed their efforts. Almost all who are consecrated are country people, who work hard and have not very much time for service. During the year 302 books and 1,617 booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. Ninety meetings have been held, with an attendance of 4,035. While several different nationalities live within the borders of that country, the chief part of the work is done among the German-speaking people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark492"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark493"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Sing unto the Lord a new song.”—Isa. 42:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J</span><span class="font0">EHOVAH has fixed a definite time when the new song shall begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That fixed time is when the Lord builds up Zion. It is then that Jehovah appears in his glory to those of Zion. That marks the beginning of the day which Jehovah has made, and all of those wholly devoted to him rejoice in that day. The faithful followers of Christ have entered into the joy of the Lord, and a new song is in each heart and mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The elect servant of Jehovah is Christ, including those members of his body who have been resurrected and who are with him, and those faithful ones on earth who are joyful in hope of their resurrection change to everlasting glory. To such remnant on the earth Jehovah says: ‘Ye are my witnesses.” Such are to testify to the nations the good news of God’s kingdom. It is to the elect servant that the commandment is given: “Sing unto the Lord a new song.” God has now taken out a people for his name, and those thus selected are to show forth his praises, and they do so by singing unto Jehovah the new song.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark494"></a><span class="font0">When the babe Jesus was born the angels of heaven sang a song of praise to the Most High, 135 announcing the birth of him by whom Jehovah would give salvation to the peoples of earth. Now the Most High has more clearly revealed himself and his purposes and has shown his people that he has placed his King upon his holy throne and commanded him to rule and overthrow the enemy. Now his beloved One is hailed, not only as the Redeemer, but also as the Deliverer of the human race, all of which is to the glory of God. The enemy and his organization will now be destroyed, the name of Jehovah vindicated, and the people brought to a knowledge of the truth. This is good news of even greater joy. It calls forth a new song of praises unto the Lord. It announces that the kingdom is here. The new nation is now born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This text is selected for the year text. It is timely and appropriate. The remnant will appreciate the text and keep the meaning thereof in mind throughout the year and endeavor to live in full accord therewith. With the coming of each day the faithful will in substance say: ‘It is my blessed privilege to have a part in singing the new song to the glory of God.’ In proportion to each one's appreciation of such privilege he will put forth his best endeavors to make known the fact that Jehovah is the only true God, that he is the source of life, and that his kingdom has begun through which he will bring life to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The faithful remnant is commissioned to use this divinely provided means to open the eyes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the blind that they may see the truth; and to arouse the prisoners held in the prison house of Satan’s organization, and bring them to the light of the truth that will enable them to come out of darkness and out of the prisons into the glorious light. Those who have part in this song not only will be happy and joyful, but will be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For each Wednesday evening the prayer meeting text will be appropriate to the year text. On the occasion of that helpful meeting of praise, prayer, and testimony the text for the week, as well as for the year, will be considered, and each one may count his blessings received by rendering himself in obedience to the Lord’s commandments. For each day of the year an appropriate text has been selected for consideration which is harmonious with the year text. The purpose of having these texts before us daily is that the remnant may be comforted, encouraged, and strengthened to continue the forward movement while singing the new song of praise unto the glory of Jehovah’s name. These texts of God’s Word are precious promises to his people, and daily feeding the mind thereupon will enable the anointed to more closely walk with God. They will stimulate and increase their love for God and their love for one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.—Rev. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s organization praises him for what he is. He is the omnipotent God, and his power knows no limitation. He was the Almighty God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and of the holy prophets. He is the “God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ”, “the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.” He is holy; and when his indignation is expressed against the god of evil, nothing can or will successfully withstand him. He is the all-powerful God of hosts, which means that all opposition must fall before his advancing army. When he goes into action, even the head of the enemy organization and all parts thereof shall be broken. His greatness and his majesty are beyond comparison with any other.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark495"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">January 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<sup>102</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Your Father which is in heaven is perfect.-Matt. 5:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The primary attributes of Jehovah God are power, justice, wisdom and love; and these always operate in perfect accord and for the ultimate benefit of all his creation. He is supreme, the Almighty God; which means that there is no limitation of his power. He is therefore the Most High, from whom proceeds all rightful authority. He deals justly, and his determinations are always right. Being absolutely just, he can do no wrong; in him is no partiality. He is the source of wisdom, and his wisdom is perfect. Jehovah God is love. Perfect unselfishness is expressed in all his actions. He is in the heavens, The Great Spirit invisible to human eyes. “Be thou exalted, 0 God, above the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•Number of song, selected from “Songs of Praise to Jehovah” and in harmony with the day’s comment, follows to right of date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having delivered Jehovah’s laws to the children of Israel, Moses advised them saying: “It shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.” But righteousness means more than merely keeping God’s law. True righteousness is in having the approval of Jehovah, which results to those who do the will of God out of a pure and devoted heart. The kingdom heir is not righteous merely because he has been brought into the family of God through Christ Jesus. He must prove his devotion to God and obey his commandments out of a sincere heart, and by so doing receive the Lord’s approval. Thus he will be seeking God’s righteousness, and not his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(302)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the seed of the woman is to bruise the head of the serpent, which is the Devil and his organized power, it follows that the seed of the woman is God’s instrument; and therefore the woman symbolizes God’s organization, which is sometimes called Zion. God is the Father or Life-giver; Zion is the mother, which gives birth to the government and to the individuals making up that government of righteousness. Zion gave birth to the new Nation in 1914; war in heaven followed and “that old serpent, called the Devil”, was cast down. Now the dragon is wroth with the woman and has gone to make war against the remnant of “her seed” alive on the earth. The time for enmity between this seed and the serpent is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence!—Isa. 64:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are words of earnest prayer unto Jehovah. These words, which now become the prayer of the “servant” class, are so definite that they show that the “servant” class know that the time has come for the overthrow of the evil one’s organization and for the establishment of God’s kingdom and the complete vindication of his name. They, the “remnant” class, therefore pray for a great demonstration of God’s power and majesty before all the nations of earth that all may realize that Jehovah is the only true God. They are the only ones that really pray for God’s kingdom to be set up and for his will to be done on earth. They are really anxious to see God’s government in operation for man’s betterment. They realize Jehovah’s name has been pushed aside and that now the time has come for his name to be exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">January 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<sup>148</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people.—Dan. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Michael</span><span class="font7"> signifies “who [is] as God” and is therefore one of the names applied to Jesus Christ, God’s great executive officer. (Rev. 12:7) The fixed “time of the end” corresponds with the time that Michael ‘stands up’ or becomes active as God’s officer; hence it must mean the time when Jehovah sends him forth to put down the enemy, which was in 1914 A.D. It definitely marks the end of the rule of Satan without interruption. It does not mean the immediate destruction of Satan and his power, but that at that specific time God would take action through Christ to oust Satan from power. Only after the preaching of the kingdom gospel for a world witness will the complete destruction of Satan’s organization be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.—Ps. 125:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mountains round about Jerusalem furnish a natural protection for the people thereof; and even so the Lord Jehovah is round about his people “from henceforth even for ever”. Undoubtedly the word “henceforth” means that now has come God’s fixed time to have his name exalted, and that from this time forward and for evermore the anointed of the Lord shall have his protection while they are proclaiming his name. These faithful ones have entered into the secret place of the Most High; and there, abiding under the shadow of the Almighty, no enemy can do them injury. “Henceforth” marks the time when Zion, which is God’s organization, must take the field in offensive action against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">January 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(i^<sup>7</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The dead praise not the Lord. . . . But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord.—Ps. 115:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The name of Jehovah God is worthy of all praise. He is the complete expression of unselfishness. “We which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord” now have the privilege of blessing him “from this time forth” by showing forth his praises. His name will continue to be exalted. The creation invisible to man shall send forth his praises. All the visible governing factors of the new earth, and all creatures subject thereto, will praise his holy name. The mighty mountains will lift their hoary heads in songs of praise. The broad fields will declare the honor of God’s name. The trees of the wood, clothed in garments of verdure and beauty, will rejoice; and every creature that breathes and lives shall join in the grand hallelujah chorus and “praise the Lord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God.—Rom. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The power here mentioned has reference to the authority that is possessed and exercised in God’s organization. It is the institution which Jehovah himself employs to carry out his purposes. The church, made up of the members of the body of Christ, is of God’s organization, with Christ Jesus as the Head thereof. Christ Jesus is therefore </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font7"> “higher power” to the church, and Jehovah is the highest or supreme power. “The higher powers’’may therefore be applied to both Jehovah and Jesus, because Christ Jesus always carries out the order of his Father. The members of Christ’s body, having their citizenship in heaven (Phil. 3:20), are subjects of God and must be obedient to the laws of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">January 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(325)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for usf—Isa. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaiah had a vision and heard the voice of the Lord speaking to him. That picture foreshadowed God’s people at this time who make up the “faithful and wise servant” class. They respond to the Lord’s invitation, saying in effect: “Here am I; send me.” The truly consecrated ones are now able to see what God wants them to do on earth at this time. The issue is now clearly stated, to wit: Who is God ? Who, then, is on the Lord’s side? Who will joyfully be a witness to the name of the Lord God? Let all who have answered, “I,” look well to the provision that God has made for the giving of the witness and then quickly avail themselves of such provision and participate in singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?—Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus does not here refer to an individual man, but to the members of his body collectively who are faithful and true. The coming of the Lord to his temple is the date of vital importance to his followers. At that time he, as the great Judge upon his throne, began the examination of all the called ones, arid those that were approved were brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness and into the secret place of the Most High, and were made members of Zion. He has made this remnant class ‘ ‘ ruler over all his goods”, that is, over all his kingdom interests on earth. The remnant is therefore a part of Jehovah’s “elect” servant only by virtue of being in Christ as members of his body.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.—1 Cor. 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The call of and by Jehovah is a summons to the one who has been begotten, to discharge a particular or specific duty. Fellowship, properly understood, means partnership. It means an association of one with another, a participating with another in a certain work. Jehovah summoned his beloved Son to discharge the duties of great High Priest, that is to say, to fill the office of executive unto God in the outworking of his purpose. God then condescended to call others to participate with Christ Jesus in that work, that is, to have fellowship or partnership with him therein. God plainly defines the duties of such while on earth, and likewise has revealed some of the duties that will devolve upon these called ones in heaven. Such must do God’s will while on earth, and that joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The remnant of her seed . . . keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ.—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus is the Head of God’s temple, and all who are approved at the time of his coming thereto are brought into the temple, are built up as members of Zion, and constitute the remnant to whom is committed a specific work in the name of Jehovah. To his servant, Christ Jesus, has God committed the work of representing him, including the testimony that must be given concerning his name. Jesus in turn conferred upon his faithful body members a portion of this work of giving the testimony. Hence it is written concerning the remnant today that such “have the testimony of Jesus Christ”, and it becomes their privilege and duty to give it in obedience to God’s commands. They have been anointed thereunto.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord answered me, and said, . . . The vision is yet for an appointed time . . . : though it tarry, wait for it.—Hob. 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The vision here mentioned undoubtedly means the revelation of God to his church concerning his presence and his purpose. Habakkuk pictures the faithful members of Christ’s body during the period of the church’s activities as represented by Elijah, within which period all the fundamental truths were restored. The great revelation was concerning God’s kingdom; it was- made plain that he who understood it might run in the race-course. It was for a definitely appointed time. That “appointed time” ended in 1918. The setting up of the kingdom seemed to be delayed, but it was not delayed. The Lord came to his temple in 1918; and thereafter the “vision” or revelation was made clear even as it could not have been before that time, because it must “wait” for God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ.—Rom. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God’s anointed ones have every reason for now singing forth his praises. Because of their filial relationship they will praise him. He has adopted them into his family and made them younger brethren of Christ Jesus. He has given to them his spirit, and upon condition of continued faithfulness under affliction he will make them joint-heirs with his beloved Son. There exists between Jehovah and his anointed ones that touching relationship of a loving father who always unselfishly cares for his own, and of a loving son whose privilege and duty it is to be always obedient and faithful to his father. That confidence and love for the Father leads his anointed ones to proclaim always the praises of their great Benefactor and Life-giver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, ... to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison.—Isa. 42:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Open the blind eyes” to what? To the truth that Jehovah is the only true God and that Christ is mankind’s Redeemer, the mighty and righteous servant of Jehovah under whose direction he will establish righteousness and justice among the peoples of earth. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">great multitude of prisoners are held in the religious systems organized and conducted under the name of Christ, and these sit in darkness concerning Jehovah’s purposes. Their eyes must be opened that they may have the opportunity to come out of the prison houses and take their stand on Jehovah’s side. It is the privilege and duty of God’s remnant to bear the message of truth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to them.</span><span class="font7"> This is the most joyful work in which any creature could be engaged, and therefore it calls forth from God’s servant class the song of praise to the great Giver of all good gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.—Phil. 3:14, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is nowhere stated in the Scriptures that one is called that he might develop a perfect character suitable to be used in heaven. He is told that he must “cast off the works of darkness, and . . . put on the armour of light’’ and “cleanse [himself] from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God”. (Rom. 13:12; 2 Cor. 7:1) He can not do this by merely looking at his own admirable qualities and trying to make them better. To accomplish this the new creature must devote himself to God and show forth the praises of God who hath called him out of darkness. He must walk worthy of the vocation wherewith he is called. (Eph. 4:1) He is ehosen and anointed for a specific purpose, to preach the gospel of truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.—Luke 12:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A more critical version renders the above, “the dear little flock.” These indeed are dear to Jehovah because as his servants, following in the footsteps of the Master, their purpose is to honor the name of God both by their living and by their service. Because of their faithful devotion to the Lord God unto the end the promise is that they shall have the highest place in his favor open to his creatures. That place of favor is to be with Christ Jesus in his throne and to enjoy eternal life on the divine plane. These are to be given the kingdom with Christ Jesus the Head. They do not merely enjoy the blessings of the kingdom, but are to be joint-heirs with Christ and to reign with him in his kingdom. If faithful, they need never fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The sum of thy word is truth, and age-abiding is every one of thy righteous regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 119:160, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s Word is his will expressed. He has caused a record thereof to be made for the instruction and learning of those who follow in the footsteps of his beloved Son. By a study of his Word God’s will is ascertained. By giving heed to that Word and obeying its instructions one walks in the right way. The Word of the Lord is always a safe guide; whereas the word of man, if unsupported by the Word of God, is a delusion and a snare. Such is worldly wisdom and is foolishness in Jehovah’s sight. The divine Word sets forth God’s judgments and his righteous regulations for the government of his organization, Zion. In obedience thereto there is wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 11:2,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah will manage public affairs through the righteous government. That of itself is an absolute guarantee that the result to the people will be for the best. His administration will be actively carried on by his King, the One anointed with his spirit, who is ‘Priest of the Most High God after the order of Melchizedek’. The administration of this government now proceeds. The next act of Jehovah is his judgment upon the nations. Before this judgment falls it is his purpose to give the people a chance to know about it. Hence it is written: ‘ ‘ The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. ’ ’—Hab. 2: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.—Ps. 119:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the blessings the “remnant” now enjoys is to be permitted to see that there is but one Jehovah God and that they are his children by adoption into the body of Christ; that his Word is their reliable guide; that he has put his Word in their mouths and covered them with the shadow of his hand and will not permit them to be deceived by the enemy or any of his schemes; that they have been brought into “the secret place of the Most High” and, if faithful, shall abide there; that “the Lord is in his holy temple” and has appointed them as his witnesses and has commanded them to sing forth his praises while he goes into action against the enemy organization. As soldiers in his organization they must keep his law and perform their assigned duties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is Jehovah who saves. No matter how faithful another might be, no matter what good may or may not be said of a brother, the truly anointed will not be influenced thereby but will realize that their strength is in the Lord and that he is the one that gives salvation. Trusting implicitly in him they declare his praises and exalt his name. Such are really joyful in the Lord because they are strong in him and in the power of his might. God has made known his power to them. He supplies the garments of salvation by which they identify themselves as his and that they are saved and in the condition of salvation. Trusting in him they sing: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.—2 Thess. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new creature in Christ must give all diligence to making his calling and election sure. He must be diligent in performing his part of the covenant. The body of flesh, being a part of the new creature, must serve God. To make his calling and election sure means that he must make it firm, stable and certain; and this is done by the joyful performance of the will of God in harmony with the terms of his covenant. Thus only shall he obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, serving the Lord with mind, will, heart and body is essential to the well-being of the new creature. In no other way can one grow into the likeness of the Head, Christ Jesus, and praise Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah always keeps his covenants inviolate. He is repeatedly referred to as a covenant-keeping God. If the other party in the covenant becomes unfaithful to God and breaks his promise, then Jehovah is not obligated to fulfil any part thereof to such covenant-breaker. He does not restrict himself, however, from showing mercy to those who have broken their covenant by reason of weakness or by being overreached. Where a man’s heart remains true to God, God shows mercy unto that one. Jehovah unselfishly binds himself to the performance of his covenant, not for his own good or profit, however. God knows that if the covenanting one is faithful, the outcome will be for that one’s good; hence he encourages the covenanter to be faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.—Rom. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the faithful remnant that delight to obey God’s commands in proclaiming the good news. If any one anointed by the Lord fails to be of the remnant class it is his own fault and is due to pride, indifference or negligence. It might ordinarily be expected that the greatest event in man’s history, to wit, the coming in of the government of righteousness, would be hailed by the multitudes. Not so! It has pleased God to make announcement by those wholly devoted to him and who trust in him regardless of all opposition. These he uses to do his great and marvelous work. Small in number they are, and without reputation and influence amongst the leaders of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, ... to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 42:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah indicates in Psalm 102:16-20 that he will loose these prisoners, and states that it will be when he builds up Zion. That means when the Lord comes to the temple, gathers to himself the faithful ones and covers them with the robe of righteousness. But how will he loose Babylon’s prisoners? In the above words Jehovah addresses the &quot;servant” class as the one whom he has called to that work and of which class the glorified Jesus is the Head. This class now have the consolation of informing their brethren in the Lord, whom the clergy hold as &quot;prisoners”, that the time has come for them to come to the light and take their stand on the Lord’s side and to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cry aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.—Isa. 58:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The commission of God to his anointed ones today shows that there must be a work done to aid even those who are in Zion. It is an easy matter to become negligent of one’s privileges. Negligence is a transgression against the Lord, and an infraction of the terms of the covenant made with him. Hence the Lord God gives the above prophetic instruction to his faithful servant class. This and other scriptures indicate that there are some in Zion who may yet be awakened and take advantage of their privileges, and hence warning is to be given unto them. God’s anointed saints on earth must be faithful in this part of their work in behalf of their brethren.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, in heaven.—Matt. 24:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The sign” appearing in heaven is the proof or the indication to those of God’s temple class that the kingdom has begun. (Ps. 2:6) Since this “sign” is to be seen in heaven, it follows that it would be discernible by those who have a vision of heavenly things, and this some of the faithful would see before being taken to the Lord in heavenly glory. But they could not and did not see that sign until after 1918 A.D., because it was in that year that the Lord came to his temple and began to give the temple class greater light upon God’s Word and the significance of prophecy. By that time he had ‘prepared a place’ for his faithful, as he had prophesied (John 14:1-3); and now he had come to assign them a place in God’s organization and to give them greater vision that they might ascertain God’s will concerning them.</span></p>

To the soberly-thinking man it is apparent that nothing short of the Infinite One could have formed man. Marveling at the vast knowledge displayed in the creation of man, God’s prophet exclaimed : ‘ ‘ Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.” More wonderfully made will be The Christ complete, which in its unity and close cooperation of members is pictured by the human body.

But those who love the Lord will not be thinking of what reputation they may or may not have amongst men. Being advised of “the secret place of the Most High”, and having the witness of the holy spirit that they are dwelling there; having also the assurance that almighty power is exerted in their behalf and that Jehovah’s purpose toward them is to bring them through victorious, they must not hesitate to perform joyfully the commission that the Lord God has laid upon them. Conditions surrounding them may be such as to strike terror to natural hearts; but none of the remnant will fear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In order for the man Jesus to become the Head of Jehovah’s royal house he must die as a man. Such was God’s will for him. All who will be made members of that royal house must likewise die. Hence it is written: “So many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death.” Jesus became a new creature when God gave him the right to live as a spirit creature. By the expression ‘new creature in Christ’ is meant one who once had the right to life as a human creature through justification, which right ceased after his begetting, and who has been conditionally granted the right to live as a spirit creature. “He </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> a new creature,” and his right to spirit life shall become irrevocable in due time if he faithfully meets God’s conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s prophet declares that “in that day shall this [above] song be sung in the land of Judah”, the royal tribe. Having assured his royal heirs on earth that in him they have a “strong city”, or organization, and that he has appointed complete protection and defense for its salvation, Jehovah cries out: “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” The earthly members of God’s “holy nation” are at the gates of the kingdom of his Christ. They march on in his service with God’s banner of love over them, knowing that victory is soon and certain, because henceforth and for evermore the great name of Jehovah shall be exalted. They are kept in complete peace, because they joyfully obey his commandments and trust in him through Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Since 1918 the Lord has been in his holy temple for the judgment of his righteous ones, and “the temple of God [has been] opened in heaven”. It was after the Lord came to the temple, to wit, about 1919, that the lightnings of God revealed to his people that a great witness work foreshadowed by Elisha must be done. The Lord’s lightnings have since been seen by his devoted remnant, enabling them to see more clearly the significance of “the testament”, the covenant by sacrifice, and thus more fully to understand their duties, obligations and privileges toward the Lord. Jehovah’s thundering voice has also been heard by these faithful ones, and they have joined their little voices thereto, singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Workers together cooperate. All in the truth should cooperate with one another to the Lord’s praise. Remembering that The Christ is “God’s building” and that he sets the members in the body as it pleases him, each one should strive to do his part with full respect to and consideration of the other members of the body, because such is the Lord’s way. This is not a fear of man, but a fear to do contrary to the Lord’s appointed way. Cooperation in serving the Lord is true fellowship among Christians. All who are in the Lord are laborers together with God and partners with Christ Jesus; and all should colabor. This is the reason why the Lord’s people consist of those who are working together harmoniously to Jehovah’s glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Former things concerning God’s purposes which did come to pass were understood after the Lord came to the temple and the lightnings of Jehovah illuminated his Word. Now God’s remnant see new things which he has declared and which are shortly to come to pass. Jehovah takes this remnant into his confidence in a measure by revealing to them the precious things that are in his keeping. His purposes continue to unfold to them. They have the full assurance of his protecting care. No longer are they seeking to ascertain his will, for it has been revealed to them; and they delight to keep his commandments and their joy increases. The Lord’s spirit energizes them and they hasten to take advantage of opportunities to serve Jehovah and give praise to his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">These were the words of David, whose name means “beloved” and who foreshadowed Jesus, the beloved Son of God. The covenant which God made with David is really made and applies between God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus. This covenant includes what are called “the sure mercies of David”. (Isa. 55:3) The Hebrew word for “mercies” here is the same as the word rendered “lovingkindness” above, and means the extraordinary goodness which Jehovah delights to show toward his Beloved, The Christ, including both Jesus the Head and those whom Jehovah justifies, brings forth and anoints with his spirit as members of Christ’s body. Because this loving-kindness is better than what natural human life embraces, these members “offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [their] lips”.</span></p>

During all the centuries he has kept his word of promise to the fore in this, that he has always had some one on the earth who has borne witness to his word of promise. When Jesus came he magnified the promise of his Father. The faithful Christians throughout this era have done the same thing. Now ‘the seed of promise’ is about completed and the time is at hand when the Lord will magnify his holy name before mankind. The issue will then be finally determined against Satan and in favor of Jehovah. His name will be exalted among all his creatures on a parity with his word of promise, and then all will know that his name is above all and worthy to be praised.</span></p>

When the due time arrives for God to go forth to the battle, he whets his Sword and sends his great Priest forth to lead the fight. The lightnings of God proceed from and through his Word, &quot;the sword of the spirit.” Therefore at the time Jehovah whets his glittering Sword his lightnings flash, illuminating the minds of his anointed, making known God’s purposes concerning them, and exposing the position and the action of the enemy. The truth and light that Jehovah sheds upon his Word today are strong corroborative evidence that we are in &quot;that day” when the forces are gathering for Armageddon. These truths encourage and strengthen the minds and hearts of the people of God. With joy they sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>

Because the Lord loves those who have made a covenant to do God’s will and who yet are not zealous, he rebukes them, that they may repent. Hence the inference must be indulged that if such repent and show the zeal peculiar to God’s house they will be fully reinstated in God’s favor. But those who are given the opportunity and who yet do not arouse themselves and change their course of action, are in the way to lose all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Now gather thyself in troops, 0 daughter of troops; he hath laid siege against us.—Mic. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s people have made an emphatic declaration against Satan and for Jehovah. That means a fight. “Jehovah of hosts” is the mighty God of troops coming forth to war, and Christ Jesus, the ‘Ruler out of Bethlehem’, is the Field Marshal going forth in his name to make war. The remnant class must take its place in the battle array. Being faithful to the Lord, they must and do present a solid, compact body against the enemy and for the Lord. They pray for peace in their own ranks and put forth their best endeavors to see that their course of action is in harmony with “present truth”. Their part is to sing forth the honor of Jehovah’s name, both during the preparations for the conflict and while the battle is being fought.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel. —Ps. 76:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the Lord has gathered his people into the temple condition those of Zion in particular have known Jehovah God. His name is great to those who are really devoted to him and who are pictured by the royal tribe of Judah. But Jehovah is not known to the people outside of his organization. Hence the great issue now is: Who is God, and who shall rule the world? Hence, also, he is having his people of Zion, spiritual Israelites, tell the people of the world who Jehovah is, though few of them will hear, believe and take heed, as the Scriptures indicate. Therefore says the prophet: “Behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place. ’ ’ This indicates that up to a time certain Jehovah keeps himself secret, unrevealed, unknown and unrecognized; and that the time comes when he will “come down” from heaven in a manifestation of power and make himself known outside of his organization Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ye </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Out of darkness the Lord has called his people for a purpose and has put his name upon them. In advance of others of mankind he has given his faithful ones a vision of his gracious purposes. These faithful ones are now made his witnesses. Every one now holding fast and remaining faithful to the end shall see the complete triumph of Jehovah and the burning issue finally and for ever determined to his glory and honor. Their own reward will be an everlasting dwelling-place in the house of the Lord. It is their duty and blessed privilege to beseech their brethren and fellow workers in the field now to join them by participating in the service of Jehovah in showing forth his praises and virtues.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of the Lord thy God.—Isa. 55:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The above words are addressed to Zion, that “holy nation’’ of which Christ Jesus is the Head and which calls the nations of earth over which Christ shall rule. These nations have not known Zion nor what Zion signifies. When the nations and peoples come to know that Zion is God’s organization, and that their blessings come from it, then, as Isaiah prophesies, “the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs.” The nations will be seeking the way to come into harmony with God and will learn that it lies through Jesus, the Head of Zion. The people will learn that Jehovah has glorified those whom he has taken into his 'everlasting covenant with David’, and that Zion is his instrument to bear blessings to the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The facts show that the fixed “time of the end” was and is 1914 A.D. From the above scripture it does not seem reasonable that the seal would be broken and the prophecy made clear until after 1914 A.D. Even when the appointed time should arrive, not every one would be permitted to understand the prophecy. Those who at one time had some light concerning God’s purposes but who at “the time of the end” would be wicked because of having become unfaithful to the covenant would not be allowed to understand. But “the wise” would and do understand, that is, those who take a wise course by being diligent in keeping the covenant terms and who are faithful unto God and joyfully obedient unto his commandments, not merely hearing the Lord’s Word, but putting forth their best endeavor to do his will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Surely he shall deliver thee . . . from the noisome pestilence. Thou shalt not be afraid . . . for the pestilence that walketh in darkness.—Ps. 91:3,5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pestilence is a destructive plague. The noisome pestilence from which Jehovah delivers his “hidden ones” is the destructive plague resulting from covetousness and ambition and a wicked desire to possess at any cost what belongs to another and to take control of that of which the Lord alone has control; this leads to gross wickedness. Fear of the enemy or his organization is likewise a pestilence, because it is destructive of faith, and faith is essential to the safety of the Christian. Where there is no vision, there is no light, and absence of faith results. (Prov. 29:18) Where faith grows weak, fear takes hold. The pestilence that walks in darkness is this fear that lays hold upon the Christian because of darkness. Only those who put their trust in the Lord are safe therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, God is my salvation . . . Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 12:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Water is a symbol of truth, but the knowledge of the truth alone does not bring salvation. It is the truth known and used according to God’s will which brings his approval and the salvation of the faithful. A well is a fountain or source of water. The truth comes from Jehovah, “the fountain of living waters.’’ Drawing water from the wells of salvation would therefore symbolize taking from the fountain of truth the great truths which God provides for his people and using these truths according to the commandments of the Lord. Since the Lord has come to his temple the waters of truth have been made much clearer to God’s faithful witnesses than ever before. The faithful are refreshed by the waters of truth which they continue to draw from the wells of salvation. This they do with joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among other men; and madest thee a name, as at this day.—J er. 32:20, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This scripture has been erroneously applied to the pyramid of Gizeh. But the “signs and wonders in the land of Egypt ”, here mentioned, and that which Isaiah says “shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt ... in that day”, both refer to that faithful company of Jesus’ followers today, who are called God’s “remnant”. They were foreshadowed by Isaiah and his sons, who said: “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font7"> and for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wonders</span><span class="font7"> in Israel from the Lord of hosts.” In this day when Jehovah makes a name for himself this “remnant” does what it can to exalt the name of Jehovah; this is the purpose for which God ‘did set’ them in this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.—Ps. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems quite clear that the word “begotten” in the above text may be properly applied to three different times, to wit: (1) At the Jordan River when God brought forth his Son Jesus and gave his oath that he should be a “priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek”, and at which time the voice was heard from heaven, saying: ‘ ‘ This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”; (2) at the time that God brought him forth from the grave and exalted him to heaven (Acts 13:33) ; and (3) at the time God directed Jesus Christ to begin his reign. When God brought him forth at the Jordan and identified him as his Son, Jesus’ responsibility as a new creature or spirit creature began immediately. The same must be true with reference to those who are made members of his body.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God would have it known that no graven image can have his honor and praise. (Isa. 42:8) Men have made their church organizations and their leaders in these organizations like unto God and have claimed to worship God by and through such organizations and their leaders. All such are abominable in the Lord’s sight, are guilty of “the sin of Samaria”, and are disapproved. Jehovah has defined that his servant is The Christ, that no human being is that “faithful and wise servant”, and that he will not give his glory to another. If any are unwise and foolish enough to give glory and flattering titles to men and to designate any man that “faithful and wise servant” and to insist on worshiping God by and through such, God will not be pleased with them but will show his disapproval, and they shall fall.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Prophet Isaiah describes a seraph as taking a live coal from God’s altar and applying it to the mouth of God’s mouthpiece and saying: “Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away.” Realizing this picture as fulfilled toward them, Jehovah’s anointed ones may ask with confidence that God will graciously receive them, and such will render unto him the calves, the fruit, the boldness, of their lips. It is with the lips that we give praise; strength is in the calves of the lips. Therefore the calves of the lips represent the strength of the lips. This means that the anointed ones give the strength of their song of praise unto Jehovah. “This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.”—Ps. 69:30,31.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.—Ps. 68:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David foreshadowed the people of Zion today, and, marking the course of the great wicked organization of the enemy, put the above prayer into the mouth of God’s remnant in the earth. These words are in exact accord with the truth which the Prophet Isaiah records, saying: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, ... to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!” These words foreshadow the same class that pray unto God, as David does. The fact that God had these prayers kept in his record is proof that in his due time his course of action will be an answer to and in harmony with such prayers of his faithful ones, and such faithful ones will know it. Let Jehovah’s faithful witnesses today continue in such prayers, and take courage and press on in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.—Isa. 42:8, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, no one could have Jehovah’s honor, because there is none other like unto him. He is “from everlasting to everlasting” and the Creator of everything in heaven and earth. But Jehovah has raised up Christ Jesus out of death and exalted him above all others and clothed him with honor and glory above all others. (2 Pet. 1:17; Phil. 2:8-11) He is the “elect” servant of the Most High. To him God has given the divine nature and a glory separate and distinct from all others. God informs all creation that his own name is Jehovah, which means that his purposes must be carried out, and would have all to understand that he has made Christ his elect servant next to himself and that none other can have this honor. The time has come for Christ, as such executive, to carry out the purposes of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The beginning of existence of the new creature is therefore the result of the will of God made sure by his word of truth. It is God’s will that the creature shall come into existence, and he gives his word that it shall be so. Therefore the begetting or bringing forth of the new creature is that which flows from or results from God’s contract or covenant with the creature. The creature’s part of the covenant is an unconditional agreement to do the Lord’s will. At the begetting or the beginning of the existence of the new creature his responsibility begins. Hence it is that while the new creature is on the earth he passes through the period of test in order to meet the conditions attached to his right to live as a spirit creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.—Ps. 73:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s counsel is in his Word. There is no other way for the Christian to be guided than by that Word. It is food that is “convenient” for the anointed, which means that his Word builds up the anointed into Christ. The building up into Christ means growing in the likeness of the Lord Jesus, that is, in a full and whole-souled devotion to Jehovah God. It is from the divine Word that the anointed learn from God and concerning him. They know that he is the Supreme One, the Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to all, and that there is no other god like unto him. By faithfully following and conforming to his counsel unto the death, their progress toward and their being received into the divine glory promised are certain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I raised thee up, . . . that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.—Ex. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That which Jehovah did to Egypt to vindicate his name foreshadowed the manner in which he will vindicate his name in the minds of all men and before all creation before the final end of Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s reputation has long been at stake. This has resulted from the opposition of Satan. This opposition has grown to such an extent that the masses of mankind know not God. His name must be brought before them because all life proceeds from him. His good name, fame and reputation must be set properly before the minds of his creatures. Hence the vindication of God’s name is not for a selfish purpose on his part, but for the good of those who desire life. Now, surely, is the time for the anointed to bear witness to his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When the obedient ones of mankind have passed entirely over the King’s highway, and stand upon the earth at the far end of it, completely reconciled to God, then the knowledge of the glory of God will fill the whole earth as the waters cover the sea. Then all the people shall see the majesty and glory of the great Jehovah. Completely reconciled unto him, they will enjoy lasting peace and will fear neither sickness nor death. They will reflect God’s image and likeness and will appreciate that all their blessings have come to them from him through Christ. Feeling the warmth of Jehovah’s love, and rejoicing therein, they will sing praises to his name and worship at his footstool.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s coming to his temple indicated the time for ousting from stewardship the class represented by Shebna and for installing in that office those pictured by Eliakim. Eliakim means “whom God will raise up or ordain, establish and strengthen and help”. He therefore fitly illustrates the faithful “remnant” of Jehovah who constitute his servant and witness on the earth today. The prophecy shows that this class is clothed with the robe, which pictures approval; and is strengthened with a girdle, as marking an approved servant of the Lord; and the government is committed into its hands, indicating that the kingdom interests are placed in the hands of God’s servant class; and the key of David’s house is laid upon its shoulder. Great, therefore, are our present privileges and responsibilities toward the house of the true David, Jesus the King. Wonderful are our opportunities, and glorious will be the result to all who are faithful unto the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.—Gal. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Justification by faith is a prominent feature, therefore the first part, of the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant. The peoples and nations during Christ’s reign will not be justified by faith; their justification will come at the end of his reign because of full obedience. The Jews received the first blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, as Peter plainly stated to them, saying: “Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. ’ ’ Strictly speaking then, the “seed” is the essential One, to wit, Jesus, through whom blessings must eome to all. “The heathen,” then, whom Paul mentions above, must refer, not to the various nations, but to the non-Jews who become members of The Christ, being justified during the Christian era by faith in the shed blood of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.—1 Sam. 15:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Witchcraft” means going to the enemy for counsel, while “rebellion” means taking a course of action against the will of God. Any attempt, therefore, to make peace with the clergy, who are the sons of Satan, means to consort with the enemy and to practise witchcraft and rebellion. That means unfaithfulness to our God. Stubbornness in accepting Jehovah’s will is as reprehensible as idolatry, because it is a selfish holding out against God’s will. God is gracious to those who try to serve him. He is now making the way plain to those who desire to glorify his name. Such are not expecting or desiring the approval of any of God’s enemies. They have taken their stand on the Lord’s side, and they sing his praises.</span></p>

No creature can be capable of giving orders unless he first learns to obey orders that are given to him. This is one of the lessons that each true Christian must be taught. It has been one of the hardest to learn. The true follower of Jesus only desires to know God’s will, and then he is eager to do it regardless of whom the Lord uses to give the orders. Seeing that Jesus learned obedience by the things which he suffered, he knows that Jehovah will give like discipline to every one who becomes an associate with Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Paul quotes the above words of Isaiah, and uses them to show that Jehovah “prepared” some special blessings for certain ones. Among the things prepared, these seem to stand out prominently, to wit: (a) a vision of Jehovah’s purposes, and (b) the privilege of intelligently and joyfully cooperating with Jehovah and with his beloved Son in God’s great work. In the light of the context and of facts well known to true Christians today it seems reasonable that Isaiah’s words apply to the “servant” or remnant class from and after 1918, when the Lord came to his temple, and that the fulfilment of the prophecy still progresses. Not all who are begotten of the holy spirit exercise the privilege of enjoying the things prepared. The expression is, “the things which God hath prepared for them that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font7"> him,” “for him that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">waiteth</span><span class="font7"> for him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.—Ps. 147:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One who has been favored of the Lord and then becomes proud and haughty is wicked in God’s sight, and such God abases. Meekness is one of the qualifications of those who make progress toward the kingdom. When Jesus offered himself to Israel as king he came in meekness. He was not puffed up, nor impressed with his great importance; he appreciated that he was Jehovah’s representative. To be meek means not to think more highly of oneself than one ought to think. He ever keeps in mind that whatsoever he has is not by reason of his own greatness, but that everything worth while is a gracious gift from Jehovah, the Giver of every good and perfect gift. In meekness he advances God’s kingdom interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Babylonish systems try to hinder the Lord’s work in various ways. One way is to invite God’s people to be at peace with them and to sing their songs for them. Some also, who are apparently unfaithful to their anointing, speak to anointed ones who persist in singing God’s praises, saying: ‘Why not be more considerate with the clergy of Babylon? You might help them. Why not be at peace with them and sing your songs for them?’ ‘No!’ reply the faithful remnant, ‘I will sing praise to my God alone. Otherwise let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.’ They lend not their hand in compromise with the enemy. With face of flint they are set on Jehovah’s side. Songs of contentment and of joy and praise to him unceasingly flow from their lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.—Rev. 2:10, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus, as Jehovah’s personal representative, will give the crown of life to each faithful disciple. Our receiving the crown of life will ultimately depend upon holding fast what has been given to us from the Lord. The foolish virgin class does not hold fast to its first love and devotion to the service of the Lord, but the “wise virgins” both had the oil of joy in their earthen vessels and have gladly and actively served Jehovah and continue to serve him. When the Lord came to his temple in 1918 such “wise virgins” were the ones upon whom he laid the privilege and responsibility of thereafter representing him as God’s anointed King. The crown of life is obtainable for them if they hold fast and continue faithful unto death. The loss of the crown would be indicated on this side the vail by the taking away from one the kingdom interests of the Lord, and this at the time that the Lord is taking account with his servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One reason why the “remnant” pray this prayer for God’s wrath upon the nations is that he might get himself a name in the minds of the people. This should not be misunderstood; God does not desire a name for vanity’s sake or his own benefit. The enemy has pushed Jehovah’s name into a corner to the serious detriment of the people; hence Jehovah overthrows Satan’s works and power, to deliver mankind and to turn their minds to him that they may know his name. The reason therefor is that Jehovah is the source of life and he alone can grant life and blessings to mankind, and his name is involved ■ for to know him and his Christ, earth’s rightful King, means life eternal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">This proves that Jehovah brings forth his sons under the terms of the covenant or contract and according to his will and word. First of importance in the creature’s part in the contract is that he believe on God and Christ and fully submit himself to God and agree to do his will; then God, according to his will and by his word, brings forth such a one as his son. Thus God’s sons, new creatures in Christ, while in the flesh and on earth, are Scripturally spoken of as “born of God”. Thus the new creatures this side the vail begin “as new born babes” (1 Pet. 2:2) ; and they grow up by the upbuilding of their minds, for it is the mind of the creature that searches out the truth in God’s Word and feeds upon such truth. Thus they become more efficient in ascertaining and doing the will of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The beloved Son of God did always those things which were pleasing to the Father. Therefore the Father’s face was always turned approvingly toward his Son, and he gave not the spirit in limited measure to the Son. In the same way Jehovah looks approvingly upon those now who are covered with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation because of lovingly and joyfully fulfilling his commandments; he has poured his spirit upon them in these “the last days”. But the wicked, those who now turn from the Lord, lose sight of the presence of Jehovah and his Son, and Jehovah turns his back upon them. When any of the anointed temporarily takes a wrong course and repents, he prays the Lord not to cast him away from God’s wondrous favor of today nor to remove his spirit or anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that perse</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">cute me.—Ps. 31:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s prophet had recorded the above saying of Jesus. That was equivalent to Jesus’ saying: ‘I can do nothing save as my Father has purposed, and that I will not do and can not do until his due time.’ Jesus therefore makes clear the divine rule, to wit, that the anointed of God can not run ahead of Jehovah and therefore can not accomplish Jehovah’s purposes until the due time, and that when God’s due time arrives his anointed must joyfully do that which Jehovah commands. No true child of God wishes to even appear to run ahead of the Lord; but his desire is always to be in accord with the Lord, always having implicit trust and confidence in God. We may leave to God the disposal of our enemies and persecutors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, 0 Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God of hosts.—Jer. 15:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As never before Jehovah’s Word is at this time the joy and rejoicing of the heart of God’s “remnant” class. They, as his witnesses, also have his Word in the form of a definite message which it is a joy and rejoicing unto them to deliver to the rulers and people of the world. By faithfully doing his work they are glorifying his name and are thereby proving that they are the “people for his name”. Jehovah arranged for Moses to be ready for service exactly on time. Just so surely he has arranged to have a people for his name amongst the Gentiles exactly at the time when the witness must be given on earth. They are the feet members of The Christ. They have a definite work, by the grace of the Lord, in helping to establish the kingdom of God on earth. It is the greatest of all works amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul applied these prophetic words to Jesus. While on the earth the Lord Jesus was not bemoaning his lot and saying in substance that he wanted the toils and sorrows to end that he might get away from the world and go home to rest. Not only did he not say such a thing, but his course of action indicates that no such thought was in his mind. He came to work, which meant service. He came to perform service, and he was always diligently at it. At the conclusion of his ministry he said to his heavenly Father: “I have glorified thee on the earth ’ ’; and referring to his disciples, his brethren, he added: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. ” He sang Jehovah’s praises throughout life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, oh that ye would hear his voice! Harden not your heart.—Ps. 95:7,8, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul quoted from these words and applied them to the close of the age of God’s favor to the Jews; and, according to the rule he laid down, they apply with more force to the end of this world when God is gathering his saints together unto him. As the great Shepherd he gathers them as his sheep into a green pasture, and feeds them at the hand of the “good Shepherd”, Christ Jesus. Since coming to his temple he speaks to the temple class that they harden not their hearts but rather rejoice to hear his voice of command. Some, however, do harden their hearts and turn away and will not engage in the glad song announcing God’s kingdom. The Lord warns against this course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, , . . to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory.—1 Sam. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus said: &quot;Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased.” The proud forget that Jesus did not come to earth to exalt himself; he was always lowly in heart. He never put forth an effort to receive honor and glory from men. He did not even seek glory for his faithfulness in the performance of his covenant. He asked God for only what he had previously enjoyed. (John 17: 5) He came to earth to do his Father’s will, and that he did. Every one who will inherit the throne of glory with &quot;the prince of the kings of the earth” must do the same thing. Jesus is the perfect pattern, and all who please God must follow the course that he took. Jehovah does the exalting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 12:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is the positive command to the inhabitants of Zion to cry out and shout. Jehovah has made Zion his dwelling-place, and now he tells every one of Zion, his organization, to shout forth boldly and fearlessly that the name of Jehovah is exalted and that the time for his kingdom to be established is here and that Satan’s organization must fall. It is no time for temporizing with those who claim to be in the truth and yet oppose the proclamation of God’s message to the peoples of earth. It is no time for true Christians to apologize for being on the earth or to assume an apologetic air as they approach the people with the kingdom message. The command is to &quot;cry out and shout”, for Jehovah, &quot;the Holy One of Israel,” is with them. Therefore the anointed go to their duty with joy and with good courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord.—Ps. 116:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one receives a good gift from another and is unthankful, there is something wrong in the heart of the one receiving. Gratitude is the first step in the exercise of true love. Where there is no gratitude on the part of the receiver of a gift toward the giver, selfishness has control over the receiver. The rules of action for the government of God’s intelligent creation never change; they are eternal. It is pleasing to Jehovah to he offered thanksgiving for all that one has received from the Lord. God’s apostle reminds Christians of their privilege of “giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ”. Gratitude should furnish us additional incentive to pay our consecration vows to God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.—Isa. 55:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David means “beloved one”. The covenant which God made with David the king of Israel is really made and applies between God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus. That the above prophecy applies to Jesus Christ is made certain by the Apostle Paul, in Acts 13:34. The covenant applied at the time of the anointing of Jesus, when he became “the seed of David”. After Jesus was raised from the dead the covenant was confirmed unto him. It was at the institution of the memorial of his death that Jesus told his faithful disciples that they would be taken into this everlasting covenant. It was due to God’s extraordinary goodness, his “sure mercies”, and due to Jesus’ unselfishness, that this arrangement was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Ye </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">shall flee to the valley of the mountains; . . . the light shall not be clear, nor dark: but ... at evening time it shall be light.—Zech. 14:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Out through the valley of blessings from east to west is built the King’s highway, the mighty causeway that Jehovah God has banked up, that the exiles might return to him. Toward the north there is a great mountain, and one also to the south; and between lies that wonderful valley. It has a gradual ascent, but to those walking circumspectly upon it the way is easy of travel. Light shines into that valley all the time, so that it is not clear and bright only in some places and dark in others; nor does that light grow dim and fade away at eventime. What is that light, so soft, gentle, peaceful and inviting? It is not from the sun, the moon, or the stars; it is the glory of Jehovah God and of his beloved Son.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, . . . then let them which be in Judcea flee into the mountains.—Matt. 24:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Proud and boastful in word and manner (and hence abominable—Prov. 6:16-19) the combined element of the religious part of Satan’s organization set up in place of God’s kingdom under Christ that man-made thing, the League of Nations, highly esteemed among men but an abomination in God’s sight. Jesus’ plain statement is that this “abomination” would be seen after the end of the world. He tells the faithful they must bear the kingdom message to the nations as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">witness. The faithful have joined in doing this and all such are therefore “in Judaea” (meaning the condition of “praise” to Jehovah’s name—Gen. 29:35), and in obedience to Jesus’ words have turned themselves wholly to the kingdom of God and his Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The relative position of the glorified Jesus with regard to the church on earth is in the east. (Isa. 41: 2; 46:11) All light upon the divine purpose originates with Jehovah, and when he reveals his light to his anointed church he does so through the Head of his organization, Christ Jesus. No human being is able to make lightning. Likewise no human being is able to point to the fact that Christ is at some local spot on earth. The lightning is not confined to a local place; it is seen by those who are watching. Just so Christ’s presence is revealed to those anointed ones who are looking for the manifestation of his presence. The Son of man’s coming, as mentioned above, specifically refers to his coming to the temple of God for judgment. Let none be now deceived; the judgment is on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 133:3, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How good and how delightful it is for all the members of the remnant, who are God’s witnesses on the earth, now to dwell togethei’ in peace. That eternal stability and sweet serenity, pictured by the mountains of Zion, should be their daily portion. Such peace and unity in mind, heart and action, God’s prophet likens unto dew descending upon Zion with the copiousness with which it descends upon Mount Hermon. The snow, during the summer months, condenses the vaporous clouds that envelop Hermon, so that abundant dews descend, and this while the surrounding country may be parched. It is like the “oil of joy”, descending from Jehovah upon our glorified Head Christ Jesus and flowing down and refreshing his body members.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chron. 20:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus Jehoshaphat appointed certain ones for a specific purpose. They were not to be sad of countenance, nor to cover themselves with sackcloth and ashes, nor to mourn, nor to have the spirit of heaviness. They were to sing praise to Jehovah, though they were face to face with a great host of enemies and were absolutely incapable of meeting these warriors on equal terms. When these singers began to sing Jehovah’s praises, the Lord gave them salvation from their enemies. From this picture we learn the lesson that the battle is the Lord’s; and while the battle is on between Jehovah and Satan, under the leadership of the “Faithful and True’’, God’s anointed ones are to sing praise to him as his witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Viewed together, Ezekiel’s vision of the cherubic creatures and the wheels gives the appearance of an immense chariot-like organization extending high into the heavens and over all of which Jehovah presides. Next to him is Christ Jesus, his great executive officer. With him in heaven, as a part of this organization, are the risen saints and the legions of glorious and faithful angels; and down on earth are the “feet of him’’, those who are the members of Christ and yet on earth. The entire organization revolves within a circlet of divine wisdom, pictured by eyes, and is directed by “the wisdom that is from above”. Every part of the divine organization moves in exact harmony with the will of the great Jehovah God. The vision is fulfilled in this the day of God’s vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Having predestinated us ... to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.—Eph. 1:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long centuries ago Jehovah purposed to have a company taken from amongst men and to form it into the body of Christ. He then made the rule that such company should be “holy and without blame before him in love”. That rule requires, not present perfection in our words, or acts, or even in our thoughts, but perfection in love, which means an unselfish and unalloyed devotion unto God. Being thus perfect, the new creature on earth is blameless before God. The present imperfections of the anointed ones are made up for by the Lord Jesus; they are covered. “Ye are complete in him.” To the end that this favored company might be selected, God provided redemption through Christ’s blood. This is all to the praise of his glorious grace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One can not see the kingdom of God except he be brought forth by the power from above, which is God’s power or spirit. He must know the truth, symbolized by water, because it is by reason of the truth and the power of God exercised toward the creature that he enters into the kingdom. He must become a new creature while on the earth, being brought forth by the will and Word of God. He must have a training as a new creature while on earth and grow up into the full stature of the man Christ Jesus before he can have an entrance into the kingdom of glory. When he is abundantly ushered into that kingdom he will be granted a glorious body and will then be a new creature brought forth in glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jesus, “for the joy that was set before him” of vindicating his Father’s name, endured the cross and proved faithful. Now as Jehovah’s anointed King he has entered into that joy. Now also those who are children of Zion, time and faithful Christians, see that they enter into the joy of the Lord when they discern the great privilege of being witnesses for Jehovah while this wicked world is passing away. They see that now has come the time for the establishment of God’s kingdom; that soon the church will enter into complete glory; and that then the people will be released from bondage, the Devil bound, Jehovah’s name vindicated and magnified, and the people blessed. This thrills their hearts with joy. They employ their bodies in harmoniously praising Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Since the great dragon has gone forth to make war against the remnant of the seed of the woman who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, Jehovah has hidden them in the “secret place of the Most High”. While in their hiding-place -will the remnant be idle ? Not by any means. No one can remain idle and remain in the remnant class. Hiding in the secret of God’s tabernacle does not mean that they will be out of view of the enemy or be fearful that the enemy might see their movements. On the contrary, they will be very active, and their cup of joy will be overflowing. Concerning this it is written: “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. ’ ’ They have an active part in God’s organization in this time of the expression of his righteous indignation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The answer to this question is, Those found faithful since the Lord came to his temple in 1918. The goods of the Lord are all his interests. The Lord has made this “faithful and wise’’ class ruler over all his goods, or kingdom interests, on earth. Continued faithfulness unto death is required of each one who remains in this “faithful and wise servant” class. Therefore the obligation laid upon each one of that class, from this time forward, is faithfulness in performing his or her part of the covenant with the Lord. To those who continue faithful he has promised to grant an abundant entrance into his everlasting kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ, having become the heir of God’s covenant with David for the kingdom, came into possession of “the key of David”. As Jehovah’s Representative he opened to the anointed ones the door of opportunity for proclaiming the kingdom message, and the same having been opened, none can now shut this door of opportunity. The reformation that preceded the preparation of the Lord’s way had been overreached by the world’s wrongful influence; but while preparing the way the present Lord has kept the door open that the message of salvation might be declared. No more should the fundamental truths be contaminated by the influence of false teachers and the false doctrines taught by them; but in that same period of time the Lord finally shut the door of opportunity to represent him upon the nominal church systems, and no more shall that door be opened to such systems.

No man can bring any profit unto the Lord, regardless of what he does. The reward is given to his servants only because of faithfulness. The Lord’s words make this clear: “Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. ’ ’ The faithful and approved ones enter into the joy of the Lord while still on this earth, but this privilege is given to them merely because of their unselfish devotion to the Lord’s interests.</span></p>

Hence they “bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar’’. (Ps. 118: 27) This “festive sacrifice”, as Leeser translates it, could not mean a dead sacrifice, because such needs no binding or tying. It must be a living sacrifice, therefore a sacrifice of joy, and refers to the temple class, the remnant, joyfully engaging in the Lord’s service because they see the flashes of light from the temple revealing to them the covenant by sacrifice which they more fully see and appreciate. That explains why they now so joyfully engage in God’s service.</span></p>

When God’s lightning flashes, then he speaks in thunder tones and there follows an abundance of refreshing truth for the reviving of those who love righteousness and who are seeking after the way of God. Jehovah asked Job the question: ‘ ‘ Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder?” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(R.

He provides the means or channel by and through which he brings his truth to his people, and any provision attempted contrary thereto is out of harmony with God. Hence any one attempting to conduct God’s work contrary to God’s way is a worker of iniquity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">This scripture shows that it must be fulfilled in a time of stress; that then the faithful are made secure in ‘‘the secret place of the Most High”; that their understanding is upon a solid foundation; and that then, because of their faith and confidence in the Lord and knowing his great favor to them, they sing the praises of Jehovah by telling abroad his purposes and his goodness. It is the time for the accomplishment of things which seem to the temple class impossible, yet they know that the Almighty is in charge. To them the name Almighty means that nothing is impossible to Jehovah, that ‘‘no weapon that is formed against [them] shall prosper”. Therefore they offer to him ‘‘sacrifices of joy”, and sing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Vengeance really means vindication. The time is come for Jehovah to show himself by a demonstration of his power for the vindication of his name. His vengeance is not expressed against individuals, but against Satan and his wicked organization by which he oppresses and blinds the people. Jehovah’s purpose is to destroy the works and organization of the evil one, and he lays upon his servants the obligation of declaring his purpose thus to do. For this reason he discloses to those of the temple class what constitutes the Devil’s organization. God’s servants now know that the time has come for God’s kingdom to be set up and for his name to be vindicated; hence they pray the above prophetic prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It has been since the Lord came to his temple that God by his spirit has revealed to the church many of the deep things that the members thereof could not understand prior to that time. Habakkuk 2: 3,4 shows that there would be some in the church who would not see, who would be selfish, and who would fall away because they would be puffed up of their own importance; but the faithful would live. Paul quotes the above words from Habakkuk, but neither he nor the prophet uses the word “faith” in connection with justification that precedes spirit-begetting. The Hebrew word rendered “faith” is properly translated faithfulness or stability. Paul had in mind that very thing, viz., faithful continuance in serving the Lord, and that if, after the vision is made clear, any one draws back he would not win God’s final approval.</span></p>

Now they must prove that what has been said is really meant; and this they must do by pointing out to the people the hideousness of Satan’s organization and directing them to God and his gracious kingdom as their way and means of relief and blessing. The faithful must be the uncompromising foes of Satan and everything that pertains to him, and they must also be wholly and enthusiastically devoted to Jehovah God. There is no middle ground, no compromise At all times will they stand firmly for God the Lord, singing forth the glory of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God-Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Abel to John the Baptist God sent forth his prophets to be his witnesses. Then he sent to earth his beloved Son, the greatest witness that ever trod the earth. Then he sent forth his faithful apostles who had been with Jesus and who bore testimony concerning him and God’s Word of salvation. All down through the age since then Jehovah has had some faithful followers of Christ Jesus who have stood forth for God’s holy name. Now the crisis is reached, and soon Jehovah himself will come forth to give the mightiest witness of all. What the Christian should now see is that, though it means to be beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for God’s Word, yet the greatest privilege ever given is to be in this class of witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">At the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover.—Deut. 16: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Evidently Jehovah commanded Israel to keep the Passover as a memorial each year that they might not forget that Jehovah is the Almighty God, their friend and benefactor, and the only source of life. Hence, in enjoining upon his disciples to keep the memorial of his death Jesus followed the course that his heavenly Father took. He knew that the safety of his followers would depend upon faithfulness to Jehovah and to himself. The reason why he, the Lamb of God, was to die was that they might be delivered from Satan and live; hence Jesus knew that if they would constantly keep this in mind they would then be better enabled to resist the Devil and stand uncompromisingly for Jehovah and his cause. Zion is the organization where Jehovah has chosen to place his name, and the real purpose of the memorial of Jesus’ death is the safety and welfare of those in Zion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.—1 Pet. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Israel’s tabernacle in the wilderness pictured things spiritual or heavenly. Jehovah ordered a priesthood to be selected, anointed, and installed in connection therewith. A priest is an official servant of Jehovah God, performing the duties which the Lord assigns unto him. The consecration and institution of this priesthood of Israel foreshadowed that the “royal priesthood’’, Christ Jesus and his church, must enter into a covenant with Jehovah, be wholly and unreservedly devoted to him, and serve him in obedience to his commands. The members of this priesthood are offered up by the High' Priest Jesus as part of his own sacrifice, and “by him [they] offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1 covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a kingdom.—Luke 22:29, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ words could mean only this: ‘My Father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom, and now I covenant with you that you shall be taken into the covenant and share the kingdom with me. ’ Only those who suffer with Jesus and who die with him can be brought into the “everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David”. God’s extraordinary goodness is conferred upon those who delight to bear the sufferings and reproaches that are left behind for the benefit of Christ’s body. Every one who has made a covenant to do God’s will should remember that those who have part in the everlasting covenant and the sure mercies of David must die the sacrificial death even as Jesus died, and must also suffer the reproaches that fell on him for righteousness’ sake.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with.—Matt. 20:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord laid down the rule that no man could become a member of the church and enjoy eternal life and immortality with him except that man be first justified by faith in the blood of Jesus and baptized into his death and be faithful unto death. To drink his blood means to share in his sacrifice, and after having entered into the covenant, to be faithful to the end; and that means to be faithful to God and to Christ and refuse to be associated with any part of Satan’s organization. To those who make it their business to be faithful the Lord promises that they shall have the full privilege of sharing his sufferings and death that they may share his cup of joy and his exaltation in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For even our paschal Lamb, Christ, was sacrificed. Therefore, let us keep the festival.—1 Cor. 5:7,8, Diagloti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man Christ Jesus is the paschal Lamb for the church. His blood has been shed, and has been presented in heaven itself in behalf of those who believe in him and obey. We are now under his blood. If we are to be spared and passed by we must be faithful and true to the Lord, trusting always in the blood of Christ Jesus and being obedient to what it represents. By keeping the memorial we do show forth the death of Christ Jesus. We also thus testify that by the grace of God we have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice and have agreed to die with him, “always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus.” Let us therefore duly keep the memorial to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">April 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 11:26, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ invitation to his beloved disciples to drink of his blood meant that they would be taken into his covenant by sacrifice to suffer death with him. The drinking of the cup, therefore, pictures the communion of the body members with Christ Jesus in his blood. The breaking of the bread represents the communion of the body members of Christ in being broken with him; their eating of it pictures partaking of the benefits of his humanity laid down in sacrifice. Otherwise stated, these things mean that every one who will be of Jehovah’s royal family must pour out his soul in death as a part of Christ’s sacrifice and as such be offered up by him. Such an one is first partaker of the bread, and then becomes a part of the “one loaf”, to wit, Christ, and is then broken with him. All such are put to death in a body of humiliation and raised a glorious body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, my servant . . . his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.—Isa. 52:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus was perfect, holy, harmless and without sin, and he did harm to no one. The fact that he was despised and persecuted is proof that Satan the evil one was causing the persecution, and this because Jesus was anointed to be the Ruler of the world. Jesus was Jehovah’s servant. He was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief”; and one reason was that he saw men who claimed to represent his Father, but who were daily misrepresenting him and slandering his holy name, and were heaping ignominy upon Jesus because he came from God and represented him on earth. Those instruments of Satan hated Jesus without a just cause or excuse for so doing. We are not to be above our Master in this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">We believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead . . . for our justification.—Rom. 4:24,25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God raised Jesus out of death a spirit being (1) because he was faithful even unto death; (2) in order that Jesus might have access to heaven and there present the value of his human sacrifice as a sin-offering for the sins of man; and (3) that in God’s due time he might assume the high office of Ruler or Governor over all the nations of the earth. Jesus the beloved Son had been put to the test; he went to the death of ignominy with not even an unfaithful thought. God rewarded his faithfulness and thereby for ever established the rule that Jehovah will reward those who love him and who are faithful to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">But to us there is but one God, the Father, -of whom are dll things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are dll things and we by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tendency amongst many lias been to attribute all blessings to Christ Jesus, when in truth and in fact all blessings proceed from Jehovah God. Christ Jesus, his beloved Son and our Lord, is his chief executive officer in conveying these blessings. The blessing must always proceed from Jehovah, the only true and living God, and his beloved One Jesus is the channel of such blessing. To God’s faithful ones Jehovah only is God and is worshiped as such. Their undivided devotion to him is expressed by the words of the prophet: ‘ ‘ For all people will walk every one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the name of his god, and we will walk in the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the Lord {Jehovah] our God for ever and ever.” They honor Jesus as their Redeemer and as Jehovah’s foremost representative.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.—1 Cor. 15:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The entire number of the faithful make up the body of Christ; hence the entire Christ is spoken of as “it”. The members of the body of Christ are, like Jesus, begotten to a heavenly inheritance which is incorruptible ; and by being faithful unto death they will gain the reward of incorruptibility or immortality, over which the second death shall never have power. Jesus’ earthly body was human and would have corrupted after death except for the miracle God performed in preserving it. The flesh of all Christ’s body members does corrupt. These are indeed justified, begotten and anointed by Jehovah and are new creatures in Christ, but the present organism of each one remains human and therefore corruptible. The resurrection will witness the change to ineorruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation.—Nah. 2:3, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.” (Ps. 68:17, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.) </span><span class="font7">This is the day of God’s preparation of his forces against Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s servant class therefore sees that at this time there is a definite work to be done. This work now consists of proclaiming the glad tidings to the nations of earth and declaring his vengeance against the Devil’s empire. The Lord has provided the machinery to print the message for wide circulation. He has provided the radio to send the message into the prison-houses. Having provided the ammunition and laid down the barrage, he calls upon his “mighty men” to go forward and press the battle to the gate. He will be their shield.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.—Rom. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the new creature’s begetting there is an important condition to his living, which condition is obedience to God. Of course for him to follow the right course of living in honesty and truth and righteousness is not only proper but also commanded. However, more than that must be done. He must devote himself entirely to the Lord and be on the Lord’s side in order to receive God’s final approval and be granted the blessings of eternal life as promised. He must thenceforth be led by the spirit of God. His responsibility began at his begetting as a new creature, and he must now be transformed and grow up into Christ if he will ever be of the royal house of God. To do so he must feed upon the Lord’s Word and be obedient thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy memorial name.—Ps. 97:11,12, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “servant” class is righteous by reason of the fact that the members thereof are in Christ; and therefore God declares such righteous, or right with him. It is this class that he instructs and leads in the right way. (Ps. 25: 9; Prov. 3: 5, 6) ‘Jehovah covers himself with light as with a garment.’ (Ps. 104:2) His due time is here to draw his “servant” class more clearly into his light. He has sent his beloved Son to his temple. He has provided the Bridegroom with the robe of righteousness for the members of the “servant” class on earth. He has given to these the garments of salvation. They are identified as his. The temple of God has been opened in heaven, and the lightnings flash therefrom. It is Jehovah’s due time for his righteous ones to have a better understanding of his purposes and to be glad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God shall be . . . given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.—Matt. 21:43. </span><span class="font7">Fruit is the effect of a consistent course of action that one takes. By such a course of action a person may be identified as being for or against. A child of God who without hesitation says, “I am a Christian,” who is indifferent to the approval of men, who manifests a zeal and enthusiasm for God and his righteous government, who refuses to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, who holds himself aloof therefrom, who seeks always to glorify God and his anointed King Christ Jesus, who is zealous in availing himself of opportunities to witness for Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, that person belongs to that “nation” bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">But the Lord, . . . him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Ki. 17:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is the source of life, and none can have life everlasting who oppose him. Satan the enemy would turn all men against God; and that would result in man’s destruction, with no hope of life. God has repeatedly magnified his Word and kept the great truths thereof before the minds of truth seekers that they might learn the way to life everlasting. Therefore he announced his law to the Israelites for their good and for the good of all mankind. All his laws are consistent with, and based upon, the great truth that Jehovah is the only true God. The issue, “Who is God?’’ must be decided in favor of Jehovah, and all who ever get life must take their stand on his side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth.—J er. 10:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven.’’ (Ps. 77:18) When Jehovah utters his voice in thunder tones, there follows an abundance of refreshing truth like waters from the heavens. Vapor or the dew may arise from the earth and bring refreshment to the earth and its vegetation. Frequently preceding a copious rain the dew or vapor in the early morning covers the ground and refreshes the things of earth. So it was that in the early dawn of Christ’s presence, about 1875, refreshing truths began to be brought to God’s people as he had promised. Those truths refreshed them in a land made dry and thirsty by the enemy’s agents. God has continued to bear his refreshing truths to his people, even to the very ends of the earth, and has gathered them together away from Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who is blind if not my servant! . . . Who is blind like an intimate friend? or blind like the servant of Jehovah?—Isa. 42:18, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s “servant”, his “elect”, has but one single purpose, and that is to do the will of Jehovah. Every one of the servant class must be in full harmony with the Head, Christ Jesus, and likewise have and follow this single purpose. The servant is blind to everything except to do God’s will. Hence the remnant of God’s servant class today realize that the greatest privilege they could now enjoy is to sing the “new song” of praise unto Jehovah, and this they do by giving testimony concerning God and his kingdom. Having a better understanding of God’s purposes, they have greater joy in obeying his commandments. While so doing they will be the targets for the poisonous darts of the enemy, but they will not be stopped or even discouraged by such opposition. They endure unto the end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, . . . and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand.—Rev. 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are those who complain against their brethren, and insist that there is nothing more to be done but to await the time when they shall be taken to the kingdom. These eomplainers can not understand this song because they refuse to participate in it. It is “as it were a new song” in view of the fact that God’s kingdom has come and well-known prophecies now take on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font7"> significance because of being fulfilled. Those who have already passed into glory to be for ever with the Lord engage in singing the new song. Also the “remnant” still on earth participate in singing the song, the rapturous music of the new government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">know that whosoever is bom of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 John 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the moment that one is begotten as a new creature, he is then and there “born of God’’ by the covenant (the mother) which God has made to bring forth the seed, The Christ. God’s covenant with the creature imposes upon that one an obligation which must be performed. Whether the new creature will die the second death, or be of the “great multitude’’ that must wash their robes, or ultimately be of the royal house of Jehovah, depends upon the progressive steps he takes and upon the performance of the full obligation which is imposed upon him by the terms of his covenant and the Word of God. To become a member of God’s royal family eventually, he must be a servant of the Lord and, as such, must keep himself faithful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Intimacy [friendship, secret counsel] with Jehovah have they who revere him, his covenant also he letteth them know.—Ps. 25:14, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No creature of heaven or earth &gt;eould originate the covenant by sacrifice; only Jehovah could do that. That covenant and the purpose to make it were secret unto all until God’s due time to reveal it; “which things the angels desire to look into.’’ Doubtless this included the Logos, the chief of all angels. The Scriptures support the conclusion that the covenant by sacrifice was not known to any creature in the universe until the time for making it at Jesus’ immersion in Jordan. Immediately following his consecration there, Jesus was led by God’s spirit into the wilderness, where Jehovah took Jesus into special intimacy with himself, and there Jesus undoubtedly learned the full meaning and importance of his covenant with his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Shut up the words . . . even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall he increased.—Dan. 12:</span><span class="font7">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plain use of the phrase “run to and fro” by other prophets indicates an earnest and careful study of the Word of God at “the time of the end” by those devoted to the Lord, because the time has come for the opening of the prophet’s words to God’s servant class. Daniel’s prophecy seems therefore to mean that at the stated and fixed time God’s anointed people shall exercise diligence in searching God’s Word, which is then and there to be opened because God’s due time will have come for them to understand, and his flashes of “lightning” will illuminate his Word and reveal his purposes and thereby there will be a corresponding increase of knowledge by and on the part of his anointed people. This exactly corresponds with the facts since 1914 A.D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">April 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(213)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.—1 Thess. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “called” in the text above means invited. It necessarily follows that all who become members of Jehovah’s royal house are first called, or invited, by the One who builds the house. It is God’s house or organization; consequently the call must proceed from him. The royal house is composed exclusively of spirit creatures of the divine nature. None other than spirit creatures could be invited to become members of that house. At Jordan Jesus was begotten by his Father and was audibly acknowledged by the Father as his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased. That was the very first moment that Jesus could have been invited or called to the heavenly position. No one, therefore, could be called with the heavenly calling until he is brought forth as a son of God and becomes a new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.—Ezek. 34:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He “that is to be ruler in Israel” has now come out of Bethlehem, and through him Jehovah feeds his flock and makes them to lie down in blessed security. (Mic. 5: 2, 4) This little flock have entered into “the secret place of the Most High”, because the Lord has brought them into his temple and under the robe of righteousness. There they abide, looking to Jehovah for food and strength by and through his beloved Son, “the good Shepherd.” They do not browse about like unruly animals looking for food in various places. They know their food comes from the Lord. The “remnant” well know that they get their food from Jehovah’s table through his appointed way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.—1 Tim. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immortality resides in Jehovah alone, the King of the ages. He is from everlasting to everlasting, the great One ever unseen to man. Besides him there is no god; none may be honored above him, and he will never give his glory unto any other who would be a god. His Word proves that it is his will to give immortality and incorruptibility only to those who have undergone a severe trial and proven their supreme loyalty and faithfulness to him even unto death. Jesus declared it was the Father’s promise to give him such inherent life. The same exceeding great and precious promise of the divine nature is given to all the faithful in Christ who now give honor and glory unto Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loolnng for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christ.—Titus 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words seem to apply to the time when Jehovah and the Lord Jesus would appear to the temple class as more glorious than ever before. Even so, the World War suddenly broke forth, and there came contemporaneously with it increased light to the anointed ones on earth. The Lord Jesus was present; and the sudden increased light of his presence is conveyed in the Greek word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">epiphaneia,</span><span class="font7"> above translated “appearing”. This epiphaneia took place, even though at the same time the darkness increased toward others, Jehovah’s enemies. In support of this the prophet said: “When the Lord [Jehovah] shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” It is the time when Jehovah provides the robe of righteousness under which Jesus brings the members of the temple class still on earth.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark499"></a><span class="font7">Preaching is not done merely by the use of spoken words. In this present time the most effective way of preaching the gospel of the kingdom is by placing the printed message in the hands of the people. It is a well-known fact at this time that most of such preaching is being done by the women who are of the anointed. Some of the men seem to have regarded themselves as more important than the Scriptures warrant, and have declined to carry the printed message to the people by going from door to door. Both the Scriptures and the facts show that the obligation is laid upon every one who is anointed of the Lord to prove his faithfulness by preaching the Word of truth as opportunity is afforded. Each one must examine and judge himself in this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:5,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus reached the Jordan River he presented himself to Jehovah, agreeing to do the will of God. It is true that Jesus had always done the Father’s will, but now he comes as a perfect man agreeing to carry out whatsoever God’s will concerning him might be. As a natural man he could not have fully appreciated the meaning of the covenant by sacrifice; yet it was innate in him as the Beloved of his Father to be delighted to do the Father’s will, and that at any cost. He was immersed in Jordan’s waters, and by that act he bore public testimony that he had devoted himself to do whatsoever God would have him to do. For want of a better word, we call this act of Jesus’ “consecration”. All of Jesus’ footstep followers must likewise have consecrated themselves to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(118)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I counsel thee to . . . anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.—Rev. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Anoint” and “salve” suggest an oil ingredient, which is symbolic of the spirit of the Lord; the fruit thereof is supreme love and joy. Unselfish devotion to Jehovah induces one to keep his commandments. Not merely the knowing of the commandments is that which is required, but the keeping of them also; and the keeping thereof results in further illumination. “The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.” (Ps. 19:8) All those who have a sincere desire to keep in harmony with the Lord and to “see eye to eye” with his watchmen will pray: “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.” (Ps. 119:18) The Lord has made promise that those who thus obey and anoint their eyes and joyfully do his will shall sec precious things, even “whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.—Ps. 47:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “shout” as here used means a battle-cry. When the armies of Israel were marching around Jericho they manifested their confidence that victory would result by shouting. It was the priests that blew the trumpets, foreshadowing Jehovah’s anointed ones proclaiming the glory of his name. Even so now, Jehovah has taken the reins of the world and goes forth to dash to pieces the enemy; and he does so with a shout and the sound of the trumpet, giving assurance to his faithful witnesses that victory is soon to follow. The remnant class, seeing that Jehovah, by and through his great Priest and King Jesus, is moving to the point of destroying Satan’s organization, cries out in ecstasy: “Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(304)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly.—Dan. 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words tell of a purifying work which must be done at the end of the world. At the proper and appointed time (1918 A.D.) ‘the Lord suddenly came to his temple’. For what purpose? For judgment and cleansing. Man could not do this work; it must be done by the Lord himself. He sits to purify the truth as silver, that the truth may be made clear and understandable. Then the vision is to be understood. He sits to try and purify those who are in the covenant with God by completely separating them from every part of Satan’s organization, that they may be wholly and completely devoted to Jehovah’s work. (Mal. 3:1-3) Those who come through the fire and are cleansed and approved and made white are made members of the servant of God. But the wicked are disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.—Ps. 101:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words were written for the guidance of the church. All men, including the members of the church, need mercy at the hands of the great Judge, Jehovah. The mercy and judgment of Jehovah are causes for praise to him. His children now see his judgment against those who have organized in opposition to his will and arrangement. They see also his judgment against those who repudiate his name after such have once been enlightened. They also experience the mercy that Jehovah has shown to his anointed ones. They see that he will show mercy unto the ignorantly wicked and to the oppressed. Conscious of his greatness and of his loving-kindness toward all, Jehovah’s temple class joyfully sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(52)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since all things are from the Father and by the Son, a visit may be spoken of as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font7"> visitation even though Jesus is the active agency. The visit of God when Jesus came to his temple is for the purpose of inspection, judgment and blessing. The day of God’s visitation upon Christendom having begun shortly after 1918 and still continuing with increased severity, who then shall glorify God in this day of visitation? Not every one, of course; but the Scriptures indicate that there will be many who will do so. Because of the “good works” of witnessing by God’s ambassadors many are hearing the truth now who formerly spoke evil against faithful Christians. Though not consecrating to God, they are manifesting kindness to all showing the Lord’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s electf It is God that justifieth.—Rom. 8:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s act of justifying here referred to does not mean that justification which one receives at the time of consecration. The apostle is referring to God’s elect, to those who in the past received that justification prior to their begetting as new creatures in Christ Jesus. Hence justification in the above text must mean God’s approval of those who are now members of the new creation. It is God who determines whether or not one of his servants shall be approved or disapproved, and it is not the prerogative of any one else to attempt such a thing. Hence no thoroughly devoted child of God will permit the onslaughts of the slanderer and evil-speaker to disturb his peace and equilibrium. Such a one knows that the servant must stand or fall to his own master, and not to any one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(296)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it I ye are even my witnesses.—Isa. 44:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words indicate a special work now for the temple class to do. They are called upon to explain the meaning of the great name of God, not only to one another, but to all who have an ear to hear. The “servant” class must now declare unto the people the doings of the Lord. No one can proclaim the name of Jehovah and tell of his great work who is not up to date in the truth. To be up to date means to know and appreciate the light that God gives to his people at this time. Experience proves that none will witness to his doings and his great name save those who have entered into the joy of the Lord. It seems quite certain that the witnesses -will grow fewer; but the zeal of the true temple class will increase, and they will exalt the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For lo! Jehovah is coming forth out of his place, . . . therefore shall the earth unveil her shed-blood, and throw a covering no longer over her slain.—Isa. 26:21, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The earth,” as here used, refers more particularly to the governing factors of the nations. Isaiah explains why Jehovah comes out of his place, saying: ‘ ‘ The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have . . . broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth.” For centuries earth’s rulers, supported by the clergy and also by many of the people, have shed the blood of “innocents” and have covered up their evil deeds under a covering of false patriotism. Among those whose life-blood has saturated the ground are the men and women who were slain because of their faithfulness in testifying to the name and goodness of the Almighty God. But the time comes when Jehovah tears off this covering and unveils all such wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(296)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.—Mark 13:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have those who compose the “great multitude” class been called? and, if so, have they responded to the call? If such have never been called, or, having been called, have never responded thereto, it is manifest that they could not be chosen by the Lord, hence could never be of the faithful that will make up Jehovah’s royal house. It will not do to say that all the consecrated are called at the time of justification, because only those first brought forth as new creatures can be called and can accept the call. The new creature must first have some knowledge of “the high calling of God in Christ Jesus” unto the kingdom, and then must accept it, before he can be chosen. For the sake of such chosen ones, that they might be his witnesses, God “hath shortened the days” since </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1918 A.D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.—Ps. 89:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are in the bonds of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant with David, the Beloved One, well know that in this day they are in constant danger of the enemy and without the protection furnished they could not stand. They fully realize that the agents of the enemy Satan seek the destruction of God’s anointed sons. With confidence they look up to their Father and say: “But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.” (Ps. 3:3) They realize that to those who give their unqualified allegiance to Jehovah he is complete and absolute security and is a sanctuary for those whom he has taken into a covenant with him. Being unselfishly devoted to him, their God, they can not refrain from lauding him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.—Rev. 15:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This song could not have been sung to God’s praise and by this company prior to 1918. The resurrection of the sleeping saints took place in 1918. The “remnant” today is under the robe of righteousness and has the garments of salvation. Those who continue faithful to the end will finally be of the “remnant” triumphant. Before their change and before the battle of Armageddon the nations of the earth must have a witness. Blessed is the man who has a part therein. Let every one who loves the Lord put everything else in the background, press on in the fight, and joyfully sing that sweet and blessed song which God provided should be understood and sung only by those specially redeemed from the earth and brought into his holy temple.—Rev. 14: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.—1 John 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Christ<sup>1</sup>' means the “anointed” of God. It more particularly refers to him as King or Ruler of the world; that is, it has more specific reference to rulership. Since the anointing therefore applies to Jesus as King, “antichrist” must specifically refer to that organization which is opposed to God’s kingdom by and through his Christ. It must include all creatures who are active members or supporters of that organization. All who are not affirmatively for Christ Jesus and his kingdom are against him and against his kingdom, and are either directly or indirectly supporting the enemy organization. (Matt. 12:30) Those who serve and support the organization of Satan the enemy would therefore be of the antichrist. There are many such among professed Christians today; hence we know that this is “the last time”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(242)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh: . . . and they shall prophesy.—Acts 2:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah pours out his spirit on no one unless that one is willingly in heart harmony with him. Prior to 1919, during the Elijah work of the church, the elders did most of the preaching of the gospel, that is, prophesying. But the time came when those who had more recently been brought into Zion became active in proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom. The young men and young women, whether such in years or such in the vigor of their devotion to God, entered into the field of service; class organizations were arranged and systematic prophesying, or preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, was carried on by going personally from house to house, with greater zeal than ever before. Such is the manifestation of the spirit’s being poured out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls.—Matt. 13:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The privilege of being part of God’s kingdom is greater than any other that man could possibly have, because it means to be for ever associated with Jesus in his great work. It is more than a pearl of priceless value. If the merchant would sell all he had to buy such a pearl, with stronger reasoning should a man be willing to give everything he possesses to have a part in the Lord’s kingdom. Having taken the step then toward the kingdom, he permits nothing to stand in the way of his absolute and complete devotion to Jehovah; such is his zeal for the Lord, and so enhanced in his mind and heart is his joy at having a share in that blessed kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(283)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Do unto them as unto the Midianites; . . . that men may know that thou . . . art the Most High over all the earth.—Ps. 83:9,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has whetted his “glittering sword”, symbolizing Jesus, and orders him to the great conflict. As Gideon represented the Lord Jesus, so his army of three hundred represented God’s remnant on earth today. As Gideon’s little band sounded the trumpet before attacking the Midianites, so now the remnant must blow the trumpet of the Lord God, and do so with joy. We are now in the time of the fuller revelation of God’s will, which is represented by the moon, and it is therefore a time of special rejoicing for God’s people. (Ps. 81:1, 3) Hence, as the light flashed from the torches of Gideon's three companies and the members thereof shouted victory, even so now, when Jehovah’s lightnings flash, exposing the enemies’ position and revealing their confusion, the faithful remnant shout with joy: ‘The sword of Jehovah and of his Anointed.’ They do their part, and Jehovah does his part unto the antitypical Midianites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.-l Cor. 15:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Previous to the time that the Lord Jesus arrived at God’s temple, all Christians who were faithful and died in faith must wait in hell. The resurrection of these faithful ones, or the calling of them forth from hell, and the bringing of the faithful ones still alive on earth into the temple condition took place approximately at the time of the Lord’s coming to the true temple. From that time forward the resurrection of the good and faithful Christians has been instantaneous ; that is to say, at the moment of death the change from human to spirit beings takes place. From that time forward, therefore, the words of Jesus apply: “Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(296)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him.—Isa. 42:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words of Jehovah call upon all creation to behold his servant. Beyond all doubt the servant is not a man, but is Christ, the beloved One of Jehovah. The Lord God has honored him above all. Jehovah has bestowed upon him the greatest title at his disposal, and hence the greatest possible. Such titles are not properly given to man. Those who insist on giving flattering titles to men, God pushes away from him. (Job 32:21, 22) Let all creation take notice that Christ Jesus is the executive officer of the Most High and has been placed upon the throne of authority, that he has taken up his power and has begun active operations, and that there is no opposing power that can hinder his onward march to complete victory. Jehovah takes delight in him because he is always in harmony with his Father and has always delighted to servo and do his Father’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sing forth the honour of his name; 'make his praise glorious.—Ps. 66:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is due the Lord that his name be honored above all. It is due time to sing forth the honor of his name. The anointed ones are the only true representatives of God on earth and they are greatly honored by having the privilege of representing him. The above text is a call by each member of the temple elass to the other members of the temple class. It is impossible to sing forth the honor of the Lord’s name now unless we avail ourselves of opportunities for serving him, because this means that God has provided for the witness to his name to be given. Amidst great opposition the little company of anointed ones now delight to encourage one another and together to engage in making melody to the honor of the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(276)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah his God.—Mie. 5:4, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Ruler”, having come out of Bethlehem Ephratah (the house of bread and place of fruitfulness), girded himself and caused his faithful ones to sit down, that is to say, to rest in peace, while they receive the gracious provisions made for them. (Luke 12:37) As “chief Shepherd” he stands up and feeds the members who compose the faithful servant class, feeding them upon that food which is “convenient” for them. That means that they are fed on that which builds them up. Clothed with all power and authority the Ruler out of Bethlehem stands forth in the majesty of Jehovah’s name and feeds the flock with food which Jehovah has provided for them. He feeds those who need to be fed and who rejoice at receiving “meat in due season”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will stir up thy sons, 0 Zion, against thy sons, 0 Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.—Zech. 9:13, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Daily the loyal members of Zion see the evidences that their faithfulness in testifying to Jehovah’s name is sore and grievous upon the members of Satan’s organization, of which ancient Greece was once a world power. Yet the sons of Zion go forth today fearlessly singing the honor of Jehovah’s name. What is the effect? Paul says (and we see it to be true): “Your fearlessness is unto the enemy a sure token of impending destruction.’’ God’s prophet Isaiah also states: “In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan.’’ Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great and strong Sword, and the remnant class is as a ‘sore sword’ because sore and grievous to the enemy. Nothing galls the clergy, tainted with ancient Grecian philosophy, and their allies more than the faithfulness of God’s remnant today in giving testimony to his name and to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(87)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">My son, he wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.—Prov. 27:11. </span><span class="font7">The wise son of God will diligently seek to know Jehovah’s will concerning his anointed ones. Ascertaining it, he will do God’s will to the best of his ability regardless of what others might say or even think, and thus he will be wise and make glad the heart of his heavenly Father. It is the wise son that will see the way of the Lord and understand his loving-kindness: “Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.” The wise not only will see the truth as God’s lightnings now flash, but will delight to do as he is directed by that truth and, by showing forth God’s praises, will seek to offset the reproaches cast against Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling.—Eph. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God does not have two vocations to which he is inviting his sons; he has only one. He is selecting the members of his royal house, and the calling or invitation is to that alone; the hope of the called ones is that of membership in that house, and no spirit-begotten one has the right or privilege to aspire to any other calling than that one. There is no evidence that all those who are called respond to or accept that call. Jesus said: “Many are called, but few are chosen”; that is, many spirit-begotten ones receive the invitation, but few respond thereto and qualify and are chosen. God would not arbitrarily put any one in the race for the prize without that one’s consent, because if he did so it would be inconsistent with the call or invitation. Let those who are in the race “walk worthy of [their] vocation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(336)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven [whirlwind, R.</span><span class="font7"> V.]</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">: the lightnings lightened the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 77:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thunder symbolizes the voice of Jehovah. “Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?” (Job 40: 9) In 1914 Jehovah placed his King upon his holy hill of Zion. At that time the great World War began. The voice of Jehovah was heard above the din of war, and his lightnings exposed the duplicity of the fraudulent organization which had taken the name of his beloved Son. Jehovah’s thundering voice has been heard by his faithful witnesses, and they have mingled their own little voices therewith. With thunder there comes rain in abundance. (Job 38: 34) Rain is a symbol of refreshing truth, the truth that has refreshed and made glad the heart of the people of God. “Thou, 0 God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shall devote their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.—Mic. 4:13, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since 1922 the Lord’s little army of colporteurs and workers in the class organizations have gone forth with books and put them in the hands of many orderloving people, and have thereby beaten down much opposition which the clergy by arousing prejudice have caused. Hence they have ‘ beaten in pieces many peoples’, and now the people are forsaking the ecclesiastical systems as never heretofore. The Lord’s witnesses have received some monetary “gain” in going from door to door with the books; but this little gain from the distribution of millions of books has been used to make more books or been otherwise used by God’s zealous remnant to carry on the Lord’s work. It has been devoted to the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.—Ps. 99:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no other God save the only true and Almighty God, Jehovah, the Most High. Now every creature has his god, but only a few men on earth know the true God and worship him. The only true worship is the worship of Jehovah God and of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. All other worship is devilish. Jehovah is worthy of praise to be sung by every thing that has intelligence. The time will come when everything will joyfully praise his name and exalt him. None others will enjoy everlasting existence. Jesus emphasized the fact that Jehovah in his due time would set up a righteous government among men and would destroy the rule of Satan and all false gods. And now “the Lord [Jehovah] reigueth”. Let his remnant exalt and worship him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">We all, with open face, &quot;beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s “able ministers of the new testament’’ have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">mental vision of Christ. Having his spirit, and their hearts being set upon the Lord, they see, not their own selfishness reflected, but Christ reflected, as though they were looking into a mirror. Thereby they are changed into the likeness of the Lord gradually, that is, they become more unselfishly devoted to God and to the ministry which Jehovah has committed unto the new creation. They unselfishly give attention to the interests of the kingdom committed to them. More clearly they see that Jehovah has given the holy spirit to them that they might represent the Lord’s interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(147)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, . . . and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.—2 Cor. 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is the Savior of men. To save men from perishing he exercised himself in behalf of man and in strict harmony with justice. He took the initiative looking to man’s reconciliation, and he did so because he is love. It is his purpose of salvation and reconciliation that is being worked out for mankind’s benefit, and his beloved Son Jesus is the great instrument God is using to accomplish his purpose. The knowledge of this truth must in due time be given to all men. Be it known that now is the time when God is beginning to open the gates of truth for the benefit of the human family; and to the remnant he has given the word, the message, of reconciliation to proclaim unto them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.—Ps. 23:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah anointed the Head of The Christ with the “oil of joy’’. The cup, though being a symbol of participating in the death of Christ, is also a symbol of entering into the joy of the Lord. The Lord has come to his temple, and all the temple class must be tested and proved. Those approved he invites to enter into his joy now. The time has come for Christ Jesus, as the great High Priest, to vindicate the great and holy name of his Father, Jehovah. This affords him great joy. He invites his followers to share in that joy and to devote themselves entirely to the Lord God and his service. To be joyful in the Lord all selfishness must be put aside. Let the anointed ones thus do and show forth the praises of Jehovah, who has done everything for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">So let all thine enemies perish, 0 Lord: hut let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.—Judg. 5:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Psalm 19:5 describes the sun “as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race”. Jesus is the “Sun of righteousness”. Jehovah raised him out of death and exalted him above all others in heaven. Yet there was something that Jesus longed to see accomplished, and that was the destruction of the enemy and his organization and his Father’s name placed in the proper position before all his creatures. Hence when the Gentile times ended he rejoiced to go forth in his might at the Father’s command and begin the battle against the enemy. The joy of the Lord is the vindication of his Father’s name. He has begun that work as Jehovah’s chief officer; he will finish it gloriously and to the glory of his Father. The faithful remnant that truly love Jehovah now share the Lord’s joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. —John 15 : 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This tells that Jehovah planted Jesus as the true vine. The fruitage which he sought was not souls for heaven; not character development; but the fruitage was and is a people to do his work on earth at the time he intended it to be done. So particular was Jehovah about this that he did not appoint another as husbandman to attend the vine. Jehovah himself has looked after his vineyard. Jehovah has produced his desired fruit, to wit, a people to do his service; and at that time when he requires the work to be done he has a people for the honor of his name. The anointed ones on earth, therefore, now see their privileges and responsibilities before them. Their work is now set before them just as Jesus’ work was set before him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.—Ps. 50:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The judging of all those who profess to be “his people” is by no means an unimportant feature. God gives it precedence over the judgment of the peoples: “judgment must </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">begin</span><span class="font7"> at the house of God.” The judgment throne is now set in the temple in heaven, with Christ Jesus upon the judgment seat. (Isa. 6: 1-5) Those in the covenant by sacrifice who have died faithful must be awakened at the Lord’s coming to his temple and stand before the judgment seat. The holy angels of heaven evidently have some part in the judgment work: ‘ ‘ For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” All in harmony with God are assembled that they may have some part in or be witnesses of the judgment; and now all who profess God’s name are having the opportunity to take their stand either for or against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall peruse it, and knowledge shall be increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 12:4, Variorum, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the purpose of granting those of God’s temple increased light? Is it that they might merely have a vision of their own coming glory? Surely not merely that. True, they do rejoice greatly in the increased light and the prospective glories of the kingdom; but they likewise see that the increased light has brought upon them greater responsibility. Manifestly the greater light is now given to the anointed that they may see what duties and obligations are laid upon them. God sends to them his flashes of lightning, thereby revealing to them what he has for them to do. It is necessary for the anointed to keep before them the things that they are expected to do to the Lord’s praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Him that overcometh ... I ivill write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God, which is New Jerusalem.—Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This promise serves as a token to indicate that the members of the temple class belong to Jehovah and represent him and are members of his organization. It denotes that such have confidence in Jehovah and also have the confidence of Jehovah, and that as fixed and faithful members of his organization they will bear witness to his name. It further denotes that those who bear the name of Jesus’ God have his backing and support, and have an understanding not only of his purposes but also of the purposes for which his name Jehovah stands. To have Jesus write upon them the name of the city of his God, which is New Jerusalem, means that they are members of his kingdom or government, and that they actually engage in faithfully representing his government. Upon them the glorified Jesus writes his own new name, identifying them as members of the royal priesthood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The. Lord doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.—Ps. 147:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Zion” has reference to God’s remnant, while “Jerusalem” refers more particularly to all the consecrated, including the “great multitude”. During the period of the Elijah work Jehovah was restoring the foundation truths of his Word to his devoted people and was thus building up those who had made a covenant with him. For many years, and especially during the World War, such because of their faithfulness to God were “outcasts” so far as Christendom is concerned. (Matt. 24:9) Then the due time came to gather together his faithful ones into the temple condition and to make such a part of his organization Zion. Sometime thereafter he showed his temple class that it was his will and his due time to have his message carried to the “great multitude”, who also are part of Jerusalem, and thus to build them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">June 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(268)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must have been at the time God’s calling was set before him and he responded thereto that Jesus saw that he must die on the cross; but he was willing to endure the same joyfully. This could not have been at the time of his baptism in the Jordan, because it was first after his baptism that “the heavens were opened unto him”. The conclusion is therefore irresistible that Jesus did not receive the call to be the Head of Jehovah’s royal house until after he was “led up of the spirit into the wilderness”. If that conclusion is correct, then it fixes the rule that the call of those who are invited into the kingdom is given after such are brought forth or born as the sons of God. To be ultimately of the royal house these must follow in the footsteps of Jesus, taking the identical course that he took.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He covereth his hands with the lightning, and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.—Job 36:32, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s lightnings are not aimless. There is a well-preconceived purpose in bringing forth at this time certain truths. His hand is a symbol of his power, and he covers his hands with the lightnings and strikes squarely home. His people are cheered thereby, and the enemy organization trembles. His thundering voice tells concerning his purpose, and he serves notice upon the small and the great. He uses his faithful servants to serve notice, that those of the people who might desire to know may know of his purposes. The work of thus serving notice, or giving the witness to the name of Jehovah, is but the prelude to the great battle of Armageddon. Those who love him can not refrain from singing forth his praises that his name may now be exalted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; ... on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.—1 Pet. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fleshly Israel by its wrongful course brought reproach upon Jehovah’s name. They were punished by Jehovah, who used the heathen nations as his instruments. This caused the heathen to boast against Jehovah and to speak evil of his name because they had triumphed over his people. Exactly the same thing occurs concerning many who have professed the name of Jesus Christ as their Redeemer and Jehovah as their God. Because of disregarding their covenant, they have justly merited and received the condemnation of order-loving people of the nations of earth; but the effect of this has also been to turn millions of people away from God and Christ and to cause the Lord to be evil spoken of. Such things are no cause for rejoicing; but those who because of seeking to glorify the Lord suffer reproach for his name, happy may they be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that spcakcth proud things.—Ps. 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elihu said: “Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither’ let me give flattering titles unto man.” It is also written: “A flattering mouth work-eth ruin” and “a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet”. (Prov. 26:28; 29:5) Flattery is a tool of the Devil. He uses it, even employing members of the church as his instruments to administer flattery for the very purpose of wrecking those who are prominent. The statement tainted with flattery is of Satan, but words of encouragement in harmony with God’s Word are proper. An anointed child of God may expect the subtle attacks of flattery emanating from the adversary and should guard against them. He should spurn flattery as a deadly poison. He should also refrain from flattering those in prominent position in God’s organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">We give thanks, for thy name is near: men tell of thy wondrous works.—Ps. 75:1, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s works in the earth today, being seen by his anointed ones, are evidences to them that God himself is near and is taking a hand in earth’s affairs. Some works he must do by forces other than his people on earth. Almost all the work done on earth by his anointed ones is to declare his wondrous works. Opportunities which they now have to serve him by thus making known his name are proof to them that God is using them, and that therefore they have his approval. Such is also proof that now is God’s due time to have his name exalted in the earth. With clearer vision of God’s purposes toward them, the anointed go on in his work with full confidence. They are not so much concerned about how long they must continue to work on earth, nor how great the danger of attack from the enemy; but their concern is faithfulness to their covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">border thereof to the Lord.—Isa. 19:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Altar” means a slaughter-place or place of sacrifice. The text, therefore, refers to those who are in relationship to God by reason of the covenant by sacrifice. They are in the midst of Egypt (the world) but are no part of it. They are daily offering up in righteousness the sacrifice of praise and devotion unto Jehovah, and by so doing are bearing the reproaches of Christ. They are also as a pillar, that is, as a memorial column that stands as a witness giving testimony. As such they are at the very border-line between the Devil’s kingdom and God’s kingdom. They have journeyed down to the time when they are about to pass over the border into the glorious kingdom of God of which they bear witness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.—Eph. 4:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Lying lips are abomination to the Lord.” (Prov. 12:22) God hates a liar and a murderer and puts both of them in the same class. (Prov. 6:16-19) Those who claim to be members of Christ should take heed to these plain statements of the divine rule of action. Talebearers, gossipers and backbiters who indulge their wilfulness to others’ injury should beware. If any one claims to be a child of God but busies himself in bearing tales of slander about another, we should avoid hearing and refuse to converse with that one, because that would be displeasing to God, being contrary to his law. He who slanders his brother, by so doing brands himself as a child of Satan, no matter what his claims may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Addressing his words to the begotten sons of God, Paul calls them brethren. He would not have called them brethren had they not been brought forth as God’s sons. Some of these brethren had evidently not responded to God’s call; they had not shown the proper appreciation of the privilege set before them, and were standing indifferent thereto. They had received some knowledge of “the high calling” and had therefore received the invitation, and hence Paul besought them to respond to it and to meet the requirements by wholly and completely presenting themselves as “a living sacrifice” and thereby to perform the “reasonable service” laid before them. And then he adds: “Be not conformed to this world.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.—Rev. 22:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the Apostle John had received the message of Revelation he would have worshiped the messenger revealing it but was told not to do so but to worship Jehovah God. Here then is the announced divine rule. The creature is to worship the Creator and Giver of every good and perfect gift, from whom all revelation and truth emanate. All “lightnings” proceed from him and are evidences of the presence of Jehovah and of his Christ. They are given to God’s anointed remnant through their Head, Christ Jesus, thereby to afford the remnant a better understanding of God’s purpose than they previously had. At the precise time the Lord suddenly came to God’s temple. After that time, as would be expected, those who had been blessed by being made a part of the temple class would have more light upon divine truth. Abiding in the light and faithfully serving God to the end, such shall see his face and reign with Jesus for aye.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> &quot;gate” as here used is a symbol of an entrance into the kingdom. God’s remnant, being now in the temple, are therefore entering the kingdom’s gates. As God’s witnesses they are ordered to prepare the way for the people by pointing them to his righteous government. They must remove the stumbling stones, the false doctrines by which the people have been blinded. They must lift up a standard, which means to point mankind to the fact that God’s kingdom is the only standard of government to which they must rally. Only those who are unselfishly devoted to Jehovah are participating in these activities as commanded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore Jesus also . . . suffered without the gate. Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.—Heb. 13:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suffering with Christ Jesus is the condition precedent to reigning with him. (2 Tim. 2:12) It is such suffering with him that Paul declared he delighted to have a part in. (Col. 1:24) Those who thus suffer are offered as a part of the sacrifice of Christ Jesus and were therefore clearly foreshadowed by the Lord’s goat whose flesh was burned without the camp. Those of the &quot;great multitude” do not suffer with Christ, and hence can not reign with him. They were foreshadowed by the scapegoat. The ancient casting of lots to determine the Lord’s goat therefore fittingly says in symbol: ‘All spirit-begotten ones when brought forth as God’s sons have equal opportunity to hear and respond to the high calling, but many thus called do not heed the call and put forth the effort to meet the requirements thereof. Those who accept the call and go on must bear Christ’s reproach.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hake mention that his name is exalted.—Isa. 12:4, </span><span class="font7">The name of Jehovah is now exalted in heaven because Satan is expelled therefrom; it is exalted in Zion because all who are of the Lord’s temple do show forth “his glory”. God has commanded that now his anointed must be his witnesses and sing forth his praises and tell the peoples of his doings that the peoples may know that Jehovah is God and the time for their deliverance has come. The song of praise has begun and the power thereof will increase, and the witness to his name and to his purposes will be accomplished in the earth even as Jehovah has commanded. Henceforth each one of the Lord’s anointed shall live by his faithfulness. If any anointed child of God draws back, he will lose God’s favor. God will preserve the faithful and give to such a glorious reward.</span></p>

They draw from their own wells, as the prophet has said: ‘ ‘ They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.” They shall be ashamed. They have forsaken the source of truth as God provided it for them, and have used what knowledge of truth they had in a selfish manner and according to their own wisdom, and have fallen away from the Lord. They make cisterns of their own, losing sight of the fact that the waters of truth and salvation come from the Lord and that no one can run ahead of the Lord. But the faithful draw water from God’s “wells of salvation”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Now the day of Jehovah is at hand. It is to be a fierce and terrible day. Before peace settles down for ever on the earth and righteousness has full sway, there is a ‘'strange work” to be made manifest which is not yet disclosed. It must be something that God did not reveal to his prophets. Manifestly it is God’s work, and therefore from heaven, and is not a work that man will do. It seems to be foreshadowed by what came to pass at Mount Perazim and at the valley of Gibeon, because the prophet refers thereto. ‘‘His strange work ’ ’ therefore seems to be some mighty and phenomenal exhibition of divine power in the destraction of the enemy in the battle of Armageddon. The remnant must and will sing God’s praise while Jehovah brings this to pass.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall utter his voice before his army; for his camp is very great.—-Joel 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the Prophet Joel makes mention of God’s mighty organization which he describes as ‘‘his army”. Christ Jesus is the great executive officer heading this organization and is described in Revelation thus: “And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True.” Joel’s description shows God’s mighty organization moving into action, and the effect thereof is to cause the earth, the visible part of Satan’s organization, to quake, and the heavens, the invisible part thereof, to tremble. The entire organization works in exact harmony, and this is proof that all that are not in full harmony with Jehovah are no part of his organization. Joel shows that Jehovah is over and above his organization, “his army,” giving his victorious command to his forces, because he is at the right hand of his beloved Son, the active Field Marshal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God’s anointed ones, now occupying such a favored and exalted position in his arrangement as his witnesses and as ambassadors for the King, must needs continually guard against the onslaughts of pride. To discern the manner of the subtle temptation to which they are subjected we have but to look back to Lucifer’s experiences. As a cherub anointed of Jehovah he became greatly impressed with his own importance; he grew proud of his personality and power. That was really the cause of his fall. Later, as the Devil, he presented the same temptation to pride of life unto Jesus immediately following Jesus’ baptism and anointing. Thus the rule is established that the most subtle temptations to which God’s anointed ones are subjected are those of pride, ambition and self-importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus was true to his Father. He was sent into the world to give testimony concerning his Father and the truth about him. The truth which he magnified above all others was and is that Jehovah is alone the true God, the Author and Finisher of all creation. Jesus declared himself to be sent of Jehovah who created him. He refused to receive honor from men or from the Devil. His title Amen signifies his faithfulness and trustworthiness toward Jehovah. He gave to Jehovah God all honor and claimed none for himself. He never failed to bear witness to the wondrousness, the power, and also the kingdom of his Father; and of him it is written: “Christ Jesus before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.” He is the Head of Jehovah’s remnant of witnesses now on earth during this Laodicean period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: ... and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.—Rom. 8; 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If one has wholly devoted himself to the Lord; finds that he has no sympathy with Satan’s wicked organization and that he has a vision of God’s organization and also of the enemy’s organization; finds that he is moved with zeal for the Lord and is daily striving to lead a clean and pure life, consistent with the “high calling’’; is rejoicing in the ever-increasing light upon God’s Word and anxious to have r. part in passing the message on to others; and is putting forth his best efforts to give “the testimony of Jesus Christ” and is experiencing great joy therein, then would not this be strong proof that he is therefore one of God’s anointed? As such he is a joint-heir with Christ and is privileged to suffer with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee.—Ps. 84:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Savior Christ Jesus has proven his complete loyalty to Jehovah, and he is happy for evermore. “Thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.” Happiness is a condition of blessedness. Jesus declared that to know and to do God’s will brings happiness, saying: “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” Disobedience to God’s law and a departure from the path of righteousness was the cause of all unhappiness. Those whom the Lord approves since coming to his temple continue to dwell in his house by reason of their constant devotion and faithfulness to him. They have entered into the Lord’s joy. They are blessed. They are the happiest people on earth today. They can not refrain from showing forth Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">When I bring a cloud over the earth, . . . the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and 1 will remember my covenant.—Gen. 9:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If God remembers his covenant when his bow appears, then also man when looking upon the rainbow should call to mind that life proceeds from Jehovah and is a sacred thing and is not to be taken with impunity. God will never change his expressed rule regarding sanctity of life. He has not tried to regulate the affairs of earth’s rulers, but he holds them responsible in proportion to their knowledge or their opportunity to acquire knowledge of the terms of his law. God’s covenant with Noah included all the living creatures on earth, and was official because it announced his law. The breaking of it time and again by rulers and their subjects has resulted in defiling the earth. Therefore Isaiah 24: 5, 6 assigns the violating of this everlasting covenant as one of the reasons for God’s wrath against the organizations of men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 6:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan and his organization not only are out of harmony with Jehovah, but also oppose him, and especially now when Armageddon is impending. There can therefore be no partnership or fellowship between members thereof and members of the temple class. No one can devote part of himself to Jehovah God and the remainder to Satan’s organization and yet be acceptable to God. God’s temple may not be defiled; the members thereof must be holy. To be holy requires them not only, as far as possible, to live up to the highest standard of purity and righteousness, but also to be dedicated to the Lord, using their faculties absolutely to Jehovah’s glory and refusing to make any compromise with the organization which is hostile to God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The term “wicked” includes many in the denominational systems and also those who have been instructed in “the present truth” after making a consecration to do God’s will. Having received a measure of enlightenment upon God’s Word and purposes, they use it selfishly and wrongfully and despise God’s further instructions as his lightnings reveal them. The Lord will break their power in his due time. Therefore no faithful child of God will use time in considering their false charges and seeking to defend himself. The Lord knows them that are his, and his strength and approval uphold them. The approval of no one else is worth while. Hence they set their faces like flint in God’s service and are not ashamed.— Isa. 50:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she tvhich travaileth hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.—Mie. 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a long period from the days of the remnant of “Israel after the flesh” until the time that Zion travailed and brought forth. The year 1914 marked the time of the birth of The Nation and the bringing forth of the King or “Ruler”, for then God placed his anointed One upon his throne. Then followed the war in heaven, resulting in the ousting of Satan. After that Zion brought forth her children, “for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” The remnant of fleshly Israel foreshadowed the remnant of the new creation; and now, after the birth of The Nation and the Lord’s coming to his temple, this latter remnant is brought unto God and into the temple condition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 12:6; Mal. 3:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course the Lord comes to his temple for a purpose, and one of the works done by him is to give to the approved ones a clearer vision of the truth than previously enjoyed by them. He sits as a refiner of silver, silver symbolizing the truth, which being purified on earth gleams with greater luster. In harmony with this circumstance is the prophecy: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” The Lord’s glorious appearing here mentioned must of necessity be unto the favored remnant class, the children brought forth by Zion and who are brought into the temple condition. The glory of this appearing unto them must be by and through a brighter shining of the truth. Hence that glory would not appear to the world, nor even to those consecrated ones outside of the temple class, but would appear to the remnant, for whom these things were prepared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Te are a chosen generation, . . . that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures do not support the conclusion that every one at the moment he is spirit-begotten is chosen and placed in the elect class. The order laid down for the spirit-begotten ones is as the Scriptures plainly indicate: (1) To be called; (2) to be chosen or elected or selected; and (3) to be faithful under test. It does not seem reasonable that God would put any one in the select company until that one had responded to the call; and even after responding to the call the new creature must surely show his devotion to the Lord before being selected or chosen for God’s purpose. After being chosen he must be faithful in showing forth Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Amen.—Jude 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is written: “Salvation bclongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people.” (Ps. 3:8) Salvation is from Jehovah, and reconciliation of man to God is by and through the blood of his Son. Thus Jehovah is the Savior of man because he is the Author of all provision for salvation and all things are from him. Jesus Christ is also the Savior of man because he is the active agent used by the Father to save men, and all things are done by him in the Father’s name and by the Father’s authority. Jehovah now rules in majesty through his reigning Son, to whom earth’s dominion and all power in heaven and earth have been given. The time is now here to give to Jehovah the glory due unto his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Grieve not the holy spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.—Eph. 4:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus warned against sinful action against Jehovah’s holy spirit. To sin against that spirit means to go deliberately contrary to the light of truth. The holy spirit is the invisible power of God which illuminates the human mind; hence to sin against it means a wilful and intentional course, contrary to knowledge of what is right and wrong. One who thus sins is possessed of a malicious heart; which means that he has no regard for the law of God, and no consideration for the rights of others, but is fatally bent on doing evil in order to accomplish a selfish purpose, and that knowingly. The day of the church’s deliverance (redemption) is here, which makes it a critical time for those sealed by God’s holy spirit. The light of divine truth shines as never before; and unswerving devotion and prompt obedience must now be shown by the anointed, lest any of them grieve or sin against God’s holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The things which God hath prepared for them that love him . . . God hath revealed . . . unto us by his spirit.—1 Cor. 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are selfish and who are not wholly and unreservedly devoted to Jehovah will surely not be the recipients of the blessings that “God hath prepared for them that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font7"> him”. Those who love God will be faithful to obey his commandments. The ‘things prepared’ are specially for the benefit of God’s remnant. The Lord came to his temple in 1918, and then only those who had been faithful were invited to enter and did enter into the joy of the Lord. Being now in the temple they are privileged to see the light of truth as God reveals it to his anointed and they delight to walk in the light. God has prepared this great day, and he has prepared the things in this day for those that love him. To them he gives a clear vision of the outworking of his purpose and opens to them an opportunity to cooperate with him now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.—Dan. 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of ‘running to and fro’ through the Word of God there has been a great increase of knowledge among the truly anointed people of God. The “wise” have received this increase of knowledge joyfully, have heeded the Lord’s counsel and have delighted to obey his commandments and put forth their best endeavors to glorify Jehovah’s name by active participation in his service. Being wise they understand and obey the Lord and “shine” forth as his witnesses. One of the works of this anointed class has been and is to turn the “prisoner” class to a devotion to the Lord that they might receive his approval. Thus the faithful anointed ones “turn many to righteousness”. If faithful in the “wise” course unto death, they shall shine for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.—Rev. 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God made Jesus the Head and Chief One of the spiritual “Israel of God”. All who are of this new creation and who would prove true to God must follow in Jesus’ steps. The course of action which he pursued is the only right one; for “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps”. The Scriptures prove that every one who would stand with the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion and receive Jehovah’s approval must take exactly the same course that Jesus took on earth. By calling Jesus the “Faithful and True Witness” God has indicated that all whom he approves among his children must likewise be witnesses to his great name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; he tak-eth not pleasure in the legs of a man.—Ps. 147:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah gave the horse his strength (Job 39:19), yet he caused it to be written: “The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord.” (Prov. 21:31) The man on horseback feels his importance and prides himself both in his horse and in his legs which he uses to control the horse. So men of the world, like the Egyptians, trust not in the Lord, but in human power, and take pride therein. But Jehovah delights not in human pride or strength, nor in them that trust therein. This is a warning to all who are devoted to the Lord that they can not trust in the strength or ability of man, even though the man in whom they trust be unusually wise, faithful, swift, and strong, as pictured by the man on horseback. It is not pleasing to the Lord for a child of his to magnify the name of a human creature or to take pride in human strength. “The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him.”</span></p>

Did Jesus go into the courts and defend his good name and reputation? No; he “made himself of no reputation&quot;, which must mean that he was indifferent as to his reputation among creatures. Why then should a child of God let Satan draw him into a controversy and thus occupy his time and take him away from a prop</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">er </span><span class="font7">service of Jehovah? Also, when slanderous charges are laid against those who are actively serving the Lord, and these charges go unnoticed by the one charged, should we become disturbed and wonder whether the charges are true? No; judge not before </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">slandered one is proven guilty upon a proper hearing and beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices . . . continually before me. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High.—Ps. 50:8,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many continue merely to meditate on the Lord and assume to offer the “sacrifice of praise” by meeting with each other, but they do nothing to carry out God’s commandments in giving witness concerning Jehovah’s name and his kingdom or in declaring his vengeance against Satan’s world system. Many such render some service as though God needed what they have to give, and they feel quite important in what they do. They insist on trying to serve him in their own way, and think God needs them in heaven to help run his universe. Let us, however, remember that at most we are “unprofitable servants” as regards Jehovah’s enrichment. Having entered into a covenant with him to do his will, we have sworn a vow to be obedient to his commandments and must henceforth serve him with thanksgiving and a joyful heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And beside this, giving all diligence, add . . . to brotherly kindness charity [love].—2 Pet. 1:5, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Love is the sum total of all that must be done in the performance of one’s covenant. God is love, and in him is the complete expression thereof. Everything he does or has done is marked by unselfishness. The Christian, in the performance of his covenant, will love Jehovah supremely. Now the time is here for him to prove his love for God by keeping God’s commandments and by boldness, outspokenness, in declaring God’s message to the nations. The Christian must be perfect in love. His heart devotion must be to Jehovah and his righteous cause. He will not fear what man may say about him, but with a burning zeal for the Lord’s cause he will be eager to obey his commandments. The worst that any enemy can do is to take his earthly life, and that only by God’s permission. If this occurs while he is faithfully performing his duty, it means his heavenly perfection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Pet. 1:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unquestionably these words are addressed to those new creatures who have responded to the call to the heavenly kingdom. For not all who are begotten of God have “like precious faith’’ with the Apostle Peter. Some have much less faith. But God has called those of “like precious faith’’ with Peter to glory and virtue (v. 3) and has by his grace and power provided for them “all things that pertain unto life and godliness”. The greatest of all blessings, says the apostle, are promised by Jehovah, and by reason thereof the called and chosen ones to whom the promises are made “may become partakers of the divine nature”, which must mean that they will be like Christ Jesus and reign with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shall love- the Lord thy God with dll thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 6:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s dignity would preclude him from commanding any creature to worship him for his (God’s) own good. He owes the human race nothing. Strictly adhering to justice Jehovah could have wiped the human race completely out of existence; but his love led him to provide for man’s deliverance, and, having done so, he will carry it out. Knowing Satan’s insatiable desire for worship and that if his chosen people followed after Satan they would be led into wickedness and must die, the love of God provided the commandment that the Israelites should have no other god, but should love Jehovah supremely. Jesus confirmed God’s rule that only those who love Jehovah with all their heart and soul shall inherit life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold who hath created these things, that bringeih out their host by number: he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might.—Isa. 40:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words, testifying to the great Creator’s unlimited wisdom and power, may be subject to a symbolical understanding. The Hebrew word for “star” may figuratively mean “prince”, and the Scriptures plainly use the word to apply to the sons of God. (Job 38:7; Num. 24:17) The literal stars shine by night and reflect the glory of the greater light of day. The period of sacrifice from the cross to the kingdom has been a long dark night; during it God’s anointed ones have been “sons of light”. (1 Thess. 5:5) Now that Jehovah is gathering these sons into the temple condition, he causes greater light to shine upon them. To be sure Jehovah knows the number of those in the temple state: “the Lord knoweth them that are his”; and it is certain that he has given to each of them a name, which in due time each one faithful to the end will know.—Rev. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.—Rom. 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us bear in mind that as servants of the Lord none of us are within ourselves competent to measure up to and perform the duties which the Lord has laid upon us. We are competent only when humbly and unselfishly we do what the Lord directs us to do. Let us give him credit for being able to know when his servants are doing right or wrong. Let us give him credit for being able to use any one in his organization. God is able to direct his work today through any man who is devoted to him, whether that individual is handsome and eloquent or otherwise. God is able to make him stand and bear up under the requirements and burdens of the work. Since Jehovah has ‘set the members in the body as it hath pleased him’, we may know that he will see to it that the ■work is carried out to his glory and according to his will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is God and hath shed on us light,—bind ye the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar.—Ps. 118:27, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the Lord’s coming to his temple Jehovah has shed on us more light with respect to the covenant by sacrifice. How then does the new creature bind this festal or joyful sacrifice to the altar? It is manifest that a dead victim would require no binding. The Hebrew for “bind” means also to order, make ready, prepare, and suggests the thought of our standing ready to serve Jehovah, presenting our bodies as living sacrifices. The covenanter has the liberty of withdrawing from the sacrificial arrangement and taking the consequences or of remaining firm and true to his covenant. It is by the new creature’s loving devotion to the performance of his covenant to Jehovah’s honor that he thus binds the sacrifice that the Lord Jesus as High Priest may offer it up to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A nd in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. —Ps. 29:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the way before Jehovah had been prepared, then the Lord came suddenly to his temple, “even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in.” (Mal. 3:1) A great testing time came upon the church at that time, and later there followed the work foreshadowed by Elisha. Those who did stand in that trial or test were approved, and the purpose was that the approved ones might “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. It seems quite clear that the approved ones were chosen and anointed at that time. If those approved at that test received the anointing of the Lord, it would follow that those not approved would not receive the anointing. If this be true, then it is to be expected that two different classes would be manifest from and after the time of the coming of the Lord to the house of God. And every approved one in his temple does glorify God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The “remnant” must now be God’s faithful witnesses, because he has commanded such. All of the temple class will now show forth his glory, because it is written: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory. ’ ’ As they go forward in this the day of trouble, giving testimony to Jehovah’s name, for them it is a time for peace and songs of joy: peace, because their confidence in Jehovah is complete; joy, because they have a part with Jesus in vindicating Jehovah’s name. Only the weak in faith and the fearful draw back, as such did in Gideon’s day. Jehovah has brought this faithful remnant into his “secret place”, and to them he is a refuge and stronghold. There he hides them from the destructive arrows of the enemy, that they may finish the earthly work he has given them to do to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.-l Thess. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font7"> far as the true church itself is concerned, it is as sure to be selected, elected, crowned and fully sanctified as it is that our Lord Jesus has already fulfilled his part of the covenant by sacrifice and has been seated at the right hand of Jehovah’s throne. As to the individuals composing the church, that is a conditional matter. The complete sanctification of each individual will depend upon his effort “to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour’’ (v. 4), that is, upon his own loyalty and devotion to the will of God and his carrying out even to the death the covenant entered into with Jehovah through Jesus. He must abstain from fornication with the adversary’s organization, for such is Jehovah’s will toward him. “Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is written (Ps. 50:3): “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.” This indicates the manifestation of God’s presence in a time of judgment. He consumes his enemies: “Our God is a consuming fire.” He also makes his messengers a flaming fire against the enemy organization: he “maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire”. Now is the time when God comes forth to judge, and his judgment will consume everything that is opposed to him. During this period of judgment Jehovah does not keep silence, but manifests his power and also causes his glorious message to be sung to his praise by his anointed remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.—Rom. 8:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Justified” as used in the above text does not refer to the time of consecration when one is washed from his sins by Jesus’ blood, but rather has the meaning of being approved by the Lord at the time the new creature is chosen as God’s elect. God foreknew and predestinated his royal house with Christ Jesus as Head thereof, and all others who are called unto membership in that house must be conformed unto his image. God calls these from among the sons whom he has begotten as new creatures. Those who respond to the call, he justifies, that is, approves and chooses; and those whom he thus justifies, approves and chooses, he honors by making them “able ministers of the new testament”, sharers in the glorious ministry of reconciliation.</span></p>

Surely he was known amongst the other men, and known by the fact that he believed on God and served him while all others were against the Lord. Such faith under adverse conditions was pleasing to God, and God rewarded that faith and faithfulness by translating Enoch; that is to say, while Enoch was still in the vigor of youth according to antediluvian age-lengths and while he walked witii God and joyfully conformed to God’s righteous law the Lord manifested his pleasure by taking Enoch suddenly away from earth’s wicked scenes. His faith is set forth for an example unto God’s remnant today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font7"> Paul rejoiced, surely Jehovah rejoices when he beholds order being observed among the congregations of his anointed ones. Everything in God’s great arrangement is orderly so far as he is concerned. Those in full harmony with him desire to be orderly and to do everything in order. We should have faith in Christ and in God that if any part of the Lord’s organization goes wrong, he will correct it. Being a God of order, he must, logically, have a visible, orderly organization on earth and must use some one therein to formulate plans of operation. Since nothing in his organization escapes his oversight, it follows that if any one in authority gives an improper command the Lord will make that manifest in due time. Rebellion against his organized way, or otherwise refusing to work in harmony with his organized people, would be decidedly out of order and against “faith in Christ’’. It savors of antichrist.</span></p>

As ambassadors they are sent to the nations </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">while hostilities exist.</span><span class="font7"> Jesus was God’s Ambassador to bring reconciliation between the people and God because they were under a hostile government; so now the members of Christ’s body participate as ambassadors in the ministry of reconciliation because the people are “alienated, and enemies in mind by wicked works’’. (Col. 1: 21) The Lord’s ambassadors are in the world, but neither of it nor at peace with it, and hence are authorized to declare God’s denunciations, as contained in his Word, against Satan’s evil system. When their work is done, God will take his ambassadors away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The bride, namely, Christ’s body, includes those now on earth who are of Zion and who remain faithful and true. Causing the witness to be given, Jehovah says to those who hear his commandments: “Come,” that is, take your stand against Satan and on the side of the only true God, and thus come to “the fountain of living waters”. The remnant rejoice at this message. They know it must go to the “great multitude” also. Being of the bride class they say, in obedience to The Spirit’s command, ‘ ‘ Come. ’ ’ Those of the consecrated ones who have taken no part in giving the witness, but who now hear the invitation and understand it and come to see their privilege of sharing in the witness work, to such the Lord says: “Let him that heareth [also take his stand on Jehovah’s side and] say, Come.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power.—Acts 10:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle does not state that Jesus was anointed at his baptism in Jordan, but the inference may well be drawn that Jesus received the anointing after he was led away into the wilderness. It is reasonable to conclude that one of God’s purposes in sending Jesus into the wilderness was that there he might acquaint Jesus with the “high calling”, and that Jesus joyfully responded thereto, and that then God covenanted with Jesus for the kingdom and anointed him as Head over his royal house. If this be true, then it would prove that the anointing of Christ’s body members does not take place at the time of spirit-begetting, but does occur after God’s call is heard and heeded and responded to and when Jehovah elects or makes the choice. Logically, then, those not responding to the call are never anointed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown flourish.—Ps. 132:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The everlasting covenant, “even the sure mercies of David,” is really between Jehovah and his beloved Son Christ Jesus and includes those who become his associates. God took away the diadem and the crown from Israel’s king at Zedekiah’s overthrow, and stated that he would not give it to another “until he come whose right it is”. That crown, when placed upon the head of the One whose right it is to wear it, would be represented by pure gold, for the reason that gold is symbolic of things divine; and since the right proceeds from Jehovah, The Divine One, he placed that crown upon the head of him who is anointed to things divine, namely, Jesus. There it shall for ever flourish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 4:12, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ensample” means a pattern or model for imitation. All the anointed should seek to be ensamples, not thereby to call attention to oneself for self-glorification and favorable comment, but unselfishly for the promotion of the Lord's work and for the welfare of the brethren. Since the Scriptures clearly set forth that it is now God’s time and will for the witness to be given to the people as Paul did it, “from house to house,” how can any one, especially an elder, be a model for imitation if he fails or refuses to take part in such witness work as opportunity is afforded him? The question of the number of books he succeeds in placing with the people is not the vital point; but it is his own faithfulness and the ensample he is able to set by his word of witness, his zealous conduct, his love in keeping God’s commandments, his faith iij God’s arrangements, and his purity from Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.—Matt. 28:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In what way could Jesus be with his church on earth and yet be in heaven ? Could he look down from heaven upon them? “Jehovah looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.” Why is this not true also of the divine Jesus? Jehovah sends, his angels to minister unto the needs of his servants. (Heb. 1:14) Consistent with this, Jesus could be with his faithful ones in a representative capacity by his duly constituted deputies, safeguarding the interests of the faithful. He had said to his disciples: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Thus the faithful have the Lord’s protection by and through his duly constituted representatives, the angels; they also have the Lord’s spirit whereby they arc comforted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea.—Ex. 15:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The demonstration of Jehovah’s power in the overthrow of the Egyptians, and his miraculous preservation of the Israelites, were for the purpose of keeping before the minds of that people that Jehovah is the only true Deity, and that from him alone can blessings and salvation proceed. These things occurred and were recorded, not for fleshly Israel alone, but God intended that his people now should receive comfort and encouragement by getting a mental vision of this picture, the reality of which is about to be performed completely. In connection therewith God has appointed a work for his saints to do, and that work is not to use carnal weapons but to “sing the song of Moses . . . and the song of the Lamb”. Meantime Jehovah will show himself as a “man of war” and will completely vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.—Mic. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a long time Zion has been the one that halted and was pushed aside. Now Zion, which is God’s organization, is brought into prominence. The members thereof on earth are now but a remnant, but the time has come for this remnant to be strong in the Lord and to triumph in his name. They must now press the battle at the gate and never falter nor turn back. Jehovah God has now put his protection around Zion and over the people thereof, and by and through his beloved Son, Jesus, he shall reign for evermore. He is all powerful; and having placed his King upon the throne, he is moving forward majestically to absolute and certain victory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The issue, Who is God? should never have been raised. There never was a just cause or excuse to call in question the divinity and supremacy of Jehovah. His works give conclusive testimony that ho is the Most High. But now it is God’s expressed purpose that his intelligent creation shall have no excuse to deny him, and for that reason all shall receive notice in due time. For this reason there has at all times been some on earth whom Jehovah has used to bear witness for him. But his written Word shows that now the time has come when he will have his faithful anointed ones to give special witness, and that the time must come shortly when he will conclude the testimony by his own great witness, that all may inexcusably know that he is God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Scriptural statement and physical facts, now well known, show that the three and one-half times (1260 days) are literal in time and began August 1, 1914, and ended practically April 1, 1918. The abovementioned 'scattering the power of the holy people’ seems to be the last scattering. The Lord’s coming to his temple at the time of Satan’s accomplishing this scattering marked the time when Christ gathered his approved ones under &quot;the robe of righteousness” and into the temple, hence into &quot;the secret place of the Most High ’ ’. The promise is that those thus gathered and abiding in the secret place shall be saved from all harm. &quot;The Lord doth build up Jerusalem [his holy people] ; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.”—Ps. 147:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Satan, by fraud, deceit, enticement and coercion, induces men to obey him. Jehovah God does not employ coercion to induce those belonging to his organization to obey him. It is written: &quot;If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not!” However, chastening is not coercion, but is the expression of Jehovah’s love and of his interest in his child’s attaining the prize set before him. God is love, and his purpose is to teach that love is the only proper motive for action. He who loves God will obey him. The anointed one who is prompted by loving devotion toward God to walk in the way that Jehovah has appointed, and who does obediently walk therein, will ultimately receive &quot;the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And Jesus, 'being full of the holy spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness.—Luke 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not every one upon whom God has put his spirit could be properly said to have been anointed by the Lord. John the Baptist was a prophet of God, and of him it was said before his birth: “He shall be filled with the holy [spirit], even from his mother’s womb.’’ John was not anointed by the holy spirit; on being asked to identify himself he said: “I am not the Christ [the Anointed One].” (John 1: 20) This supports the conclusion that one may have the spirit of God upon him and yet not be anointed. Jesus Christ is the beginning and head of God’s Anointed. When was he anointed? God had a fixed purpose in sending Jesus into the wilderness, and it seems reasonable that there God made a covenant with Jesus for a crown and kingdom and therefore officially anointed him as King and Head over his royal house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Because thou hast kept the wotd of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world.—Rev. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great battle in heaven resulted in Satan’s being cast out of heaven and into the earth. Then, that is, in the year 1918, the great “hour of temptation” upon “them that dwell upon the earth” began. It is the time of the test upon the visible part of Satan’s organization, and this test comes upon those of earth who have claimed to be Christian. The “remnant” find themselves in the earth among such, even as Jesus was in the world but not part of it. The primary issue now is, Who is God? God’s message of truth now being declared has placed the issue before the peoples of earth. In the midst of this temptation the Lord keeps the “remnant” by closely observing them and by a watchful care over their highest interest. He covers them with the garments of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">WAo </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">provideth for the raven his foodf when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Job 38:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ravens were used to feed Elijah. The raven being designated as unclean (Lev. 11:13,15), this provision for Elijah indicates that sometimes Jehovah uses imperfect things and creatures to his glory. Thus the ravens may well picture those men who brought some food to God’s devoted ones during the period of darkness and drought, which food has been a real help in studying the Bible. The young ravens are unable to feed themselves, much less to bring food; in crying to God for food they may well represent unjustified ones on earth hungrily desiring to be fed on that which is divine truth, and which will show them the way to life everlasting. God now provides food for such by using his anointed ones as his instruments to hand out the truth from door to door, as it were at the very nests in which the young ravens cry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">All the witnessing that God’s “remnant” might do for centuries could not destroy Satan’s organization nor bind that evil one. Then what shall the remnant do? Cease witnessing and wait idly for the Lord? No! Although they realize their powerlessness to overthrow the forces of evil, they know that that is not their work. They know that they must be faithful and true witnesses of Jehovah God because now the great climax of giving witness over a period of sixty centuries has been reached. In due time Jehovah will seal their testimony by himself coming forth to give the final witness that will for ever clear his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love, —1 John 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The divine record truthfully states that “God is love”. That does not mean merely that God is kind, compassionate and merciful to the erring one. Love is synonymous with complete unselfishness. This means that everything that Jehovah has done or does is totally free from selfishness. He does nothing for his' intelligent creation with the expectation of receiving something in return for his benefit. It is impossible for the creature to bring any benefit to the Creator Jehovah. He possesses everything that is good. What he does for his creatures is for their good. Therefore everything that God does is done unselfishly, and he is moved to do so by love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:18</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Clearly this warning applies to a class of persons who have been favored with at least some knowledge of the divine purpose as set forth in God’s Word. “In this book” (Rev. 20:11-15) is described the judgment trial of the peoples of earth after the downfall of Satan’s organization. It is plainly stated that those who fail in that trial, and whose names are therefore not written in the “book of life”, shall be destroyed. However, there are those of recent times who have had a knowledge of the divine purpose and who still claim to have developed a beautiful character but who now insist that God is so very loving that he will save every creature, including Judas and the Devil himself. Hence they take the Devil’s side in spite of the direct statements of God’s Word that the wicked shall be destroyed in the second death. Thus without any excuse they “add” to God’s revealed purpose. The elect will not permit themselves to be deceived into this error.—Prov. 30: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God dbideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.—1 John 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Through the Prophet Joel Jehovah had given his promise that in these the last days the “young men shall see visions”. A “vision” means a clearer understanding of the Lord’s truth; while “young men” refers to the vigorous ones (whether old in years or actually young) who are engaged actively in the Lord’s service. God’s Word abides in such, for, true to prophecy, those who have come to a knowledge of the truth in this latter period of time were quicker to grasp an understanding of the truth, to receive a clear vision of God’s purposes and of their own relationship to his work, and to engage joyfully in that work. It is written: “They overcame him [the wicked one] by the blood of the Lamb </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font7"> by the word of their testimony.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fret not thyself because of evil doers. . . . Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.—Ps. 37:1, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the Lord’s coming to his temple and taking account with his servants, the “evil servant” class has been manifested. This class not only refuses to participate in declaring God’s message, but goes further than that in severely criticizing the members of the “remnant” who are diligently and faithfully serving God; they even take pleasure in seeing this “remnant” persecuted by those of Satan’s organization which is defaming Jehovah’s name, and thus they make themselves a part of antichrist. Those devoted to the Lord’s service should not fret or be disturbed and discouraged by vile, slanderous accusations or other activities of this evil class against them. The Lord promises to give due attention to the workers of iniquity and to vindicate his own glorious name and to vindicate all who faithfully represent him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">How could a new creature, “bom” or “begotten”, conform himself to this world? By lending aid, influence, support and service to the things of this world, such as politics, social reform, and like efforts, to make the world a fit place to live in. That is exactly what a “great multitude” of professed followers of Christ have been doing. When one accepts the call to God’s kingdom and devotes himself thereto he makes himself a target for the world and must suffei<sup>1 </sup>because he refuses to conform himself to this world. As a son of God he will then pursue a course of boldness for the Lord. His affections being set on things above, he does not seek to reform the world, but seeks to do God’s will. He who loves the Lord’s kingdom has his heart set on it and makes himself a servant thereof.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In addition to being the Redeemer Jesus must also be a witness for God to the people, “a leader and commander” to turn them back to God. Jesus’ own words prove conclusively that he came to earth to “bear witness unto the truth” and that his followers must likewise be witnesses to the truth. Just as surely as Jesus was and is the Leader of the people, even so those who share the kingdom with him must act with him to lead the people unto God by magnifying the name of Jehovah God. They must now tell the people that Jehovah is God and declare the day of his vengeance against Satan’s organization, and thus give witness to lead the people to God, that some may hear and understand before the battle of Armageddon begins.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When Christ was on the earth he was “despised and rejected of men’’, bruised, disesteemed and oppressed. In the eyes of the world he has ever been as a bruised reed, and even the clergy, who claim to speak in his name, give neither Jehovah nor Christ credit for establishing the righteous government on earth. Although Jesus is the light of the world, little heed has been given to that light. To Christendom he has been a faint light, merely as a “smoking flax’’ or wick in an oil lamp. Many have concluded that Christ’s mission has failed and that God has failed to bring about his expressed purposes. On the contrary, God has bided his own good time, and now the time has come when the supposedly “bruised reed’’ and “dimly burning (lamp) wick” shall enlighten the whole world and bring forth justice and truth to all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has committed to the new creation a ministry, that is, a commission to do certain things; and this commission is a wonderful treasure, a valuable thing, and indeed the most important thing that the creature could have now. The new creature yet on earth has an earthly organism; therefore this treasure, namely, this commission or ministry of reconciliation, is given to him while in this earthen vessel. Paul tells us why “we have this treasure in earthen vessels”; he says: “That the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.” Jehovah has thus ordained it, to the end that no man in Christ may properly boast, but that the new creature might use this ministry to glorify Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

The Scriptures make it clear that the part of such is merely as servers of notice; as God’s witnesses they merely declare to the people his purposes. They take no part, in using physical force against existent worldly systems. God does not need physical help, and any such exercise of violence by Christians would be contrary to his will. Seeing the beginning of God’s righteous government, they delight to announce that it is at hand and that Jehovah will save the people and give them their heart’s desire through his anointed King.</span></p>

The purpose and desire of the Christian is to have the final approval of Jehovah; to be faithful and true to him and to bring glory to his name; to see him face to face and to enjoy endless blessings of life and companionship with Christ Jesus the anointed King. The Christian gradually comes to realize that Jehovah has anointed him for this very purpose and that fulfilling the divine commission is the condition precedent to entering Jehovah’s presence and being made in Jesus’ likeness. Hence he goes forth determined to fulfil that commission and to keep on in that course with songs of praise on his lips. As he so does, Jehovah continues to give him more light and a better understanding of the Word for his encouragement, strengthening and guidance.</span></p>

But the Lord’s announced purpose is that now the people, both the rulers and the ruled, shall receive notice of his determination. What method is he employing to this end? Chiefly books and other literature, by means of which he is delivering the witness to the people of so-called Christendom. He is also using the radio to open the way into many homes by calling the attention of the people and awakening their interest.

<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ course of action has always been in harmony with Jehovah; therefore he has always been God’s “holy One”. As the Logos, and also when on earth, he was perfect, harmless and without blemish. His holiness, however, consisted of more than perfection of organism, mind, heart and will. Regardless of his perfection of nature he could not have been holy without being always fully given over to and in accord with his Father. He was completely and wholly dedicated to the performance of the obligations laid upon him by his Father. His stedfast course of righteousness on earth led to a most shameful death, but Jehovah has resurrected him: “thou hast made him most blessed for ever. ’ ’ The members of his body are called to share his death and also “the likeness of his resurrection”.</span></p>

He bears the glory, because he is next to Jehovah and is “the brightness of his glory’’. (Heb. 1: 3) He builds the true temple of Jehovah, because he is “the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord’’; and as Jehovah’s Messenger he raises up the sleeping members thereof and comes to the temple class on earth for judgment. He is now the King whom God has set upon his “holy hill of Zion’’; and he is the reigning Priest of the Most High God, because he is Jehovah’s chief executive officer. “Behold [by faith] The Branch.’*</span></p>

Though written long ago, these songs were meant for the benefit of spiritual Israel, who form God’s visible organization now. These songs of praise are expressions of joy and are sung to the praise of God, the Maker and Benefactor of those who sing them; they are expressions of gratitude by such. The church has passed through a long and dark valley, a dreary night. It has been beset with many temptations. It is now emerging into the greater light. Beholding the light along the pathway growing brighter, the faithful ones begin the glad songs. Seeing that deliverance draws nigh, and knowing that this blessed condition proceeds from Jehovah through his beloved Son, the anointed King, they break forth with songs of joy to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Whom. Gad hath set forth ... to declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in Jesus.—Rom. 3:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The enemy has misrepresented Jehovah by claiming that God is so cruel that he must have the blood of Jesus to appease his wrath, after which he is willing to forgive the sinner. This is untrue. God is just. The execution of his law in harmony with justice can not be ignored. God’s love provided a way for the requirements of justice to be fully met, and this was done by the willing obedience of Jesus unto death. The pouring out of his life-blood as a substitute for Adam forms the basis of man’s reconciliation to God; and then, because of man’s repentance, his faith in God and in the shed blood of Jesus, and his obedience, he is justified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.—Heb. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This means that Christ’s body members while on earth are to give attentive heed to the things that Jesus did, and then to go and do likewise. He was anointed by Jehovah as Christ Jesus. He was sent forth by Jehovah to represent him. Thereby he became the Apostle of God, charged with the ministry of his Word. While on the earth he served under the direction and supervision of Jehovah. He devoted his time to testifying to the truth. He magnified the name of Jehovah God, and told the people,' those who would hear, of the loving provision which God had made for their salvation. He performed the sacrificial part of his office and provided the ransom sacrifice. He was faithful to him that sent him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If ye do these things, ye shall never fall. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off.—2 Pet. 1:10,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words bear no indication that the “blind” ones ever accepted and responded to God’s call to glory and virtue. They were “purged from [their] old sins” when they were justified and brought forth as God’s sons, but, although thus brought forth as new creatures, they are blind, unfruitful, and forgetful. They have contented themselves with taking a course of the least resistance, or by confidently resting in the hope that God would give them some heavenly salvation, and that their chief business on earth is to prepare themselves for that salvation. They have never had the zeal for God’s kingdom nor made an effort to glorify Jehovah’s name, and there is no evidence that they have been in the race for “the prize of the high calling” to the royal house of God. They do not do the things required.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.—J er. 10:13, R. V. </span><span class="font7">Lightning is the discharge of atmospheric electricity, usually accompanied by a vivid flash of light. Lightnings and the accompanying manifestations of power symbolize the operation of God’s power toward his people in particular. All lightnings proceed from Jehovah and are a demonstration of his power. This is proven by Jehovah’s words to Job: “Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Behold us?” Manifestly these words mean that God sends his lightnings and that man has no such power. When there is lightning and thunder there is usually an accompanying downpour of rain. There are no refreshing rains except those sent by Jehovah God. Likewise there is no blessing of truths that refresh and make glad the heart of God’s people except that which proceeds from Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Baptism doth also now save us, {not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.—1 Pet. 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Daily living a clean and pure life will not of itself assure one a place in the kingdom. A new creature must do more than putting away the filth of the flesh. He can not rely on his own self-righteousness, because his righteousness is from God through Jesus’ merit. If he relies on his own righteousness he thinks more highly of himself than he ought to think and forgets why God has called men to the high calling. After begettal as a son of God and hearing and responding to the call he must then show his devotion to God and his righteous cause before he is chosen and anointed. After being chosen and anointed he must prove his faithfulness before he can be made a member of Jehovah’s royal house. He must do in a positive way what God’s &quot;Word commands him to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.—Dan. 2:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Daniel described a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. Manifestly that stone represents God’s anointed King, who was born out of God’s organization. In 1914 the new Nation was bom, and God set his anointed King upon his throne. Satan’s ousting from heaven followed. Daniel’s description shows that the stone smites the feet and that then the entire image together, at one and the same time, is ground to pieces and becomes like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor. Undoubtedly this is a brief description of the battle of Armageddon, in which God through Christ will grind these world powers into a powder and destroy them for ever. Hence the time has come for the complete passing of all world powers, that God’s government of righteousness may be given full sway in the whole earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If one indulges in preaching that he may thereby exhibit his own learning and thus show forth his own importance, he is not fulfilling his commission. The anointed are chosen and commissioned to show forth the praises of God who has called them and anointed them. They can not be faithful unto God if they either refuse or fail to preach the gospel as opportunity is offered. When Paul wrote the above words to his brethren he added: “Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.” Jesus said that Jehovah had anointed him to preach the gospel, and he did so. Every one who has the anointing of God in Christ Jesus must do the same thing according as the Lord opens to him the opportunity to perform.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s elect or chosen ones were once unrighteous men and women, but now they have been washed from sin by the Savior’s blood and thereby were made at peace with God and were justified from sin; they have been sanctified and then justified or approved because of devotion to God and by being chosen by him. Many have convinced themselves that after making a consecration to God all they need to do is to refrain from the unrighteous acts and things which Paul enumerates; and that by refraining from such they are developing a character that will enable them to get into the kingdom. But Paul’s argument is rather that even after responding to God’s call they must refrain from such evil things before they will be chosen of the Lord; and after being chosen they must prove their faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He hcaleth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.—Ps. 147:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the fiery trials reached a climax in 1918 many of the Lord’s people were very much distressed. It appeared that the enemy would crush out all efforts to give a witness to the Lord’s purposes, and hence many of the consecrated were at the point of experiencing a broken heart. But when after the Lord’s coming to his temple Jehovah revealed to them that he was building up his organization and bringing his people into a condition of security, then the sore and brokenhearted ones were healed and their wounds bound up. Those faithful to the covenant by sacrifice were drawn together, became united, and began to see eye to eye concerning Jehovah’s purposes; and their grief came to an end. The knowledge that they have entered into the joy of the Lord now causes them to sing forth the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">August 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion.—Mic. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ is the great “strong hold” of the flock of God. He is the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”. He is the “tower of the flock”. He came into possession and control of all things when God placed him upon the throne and sent him forth out of Zion to rule. The members of his body, embraced in the expression “daughter of Zion”, are now brought into his temple and begin to share his kingdom with him, thus beginning their inheritance as his joint-heirs. Jesus is given the dominion of greatest importance, typified by the “former dominion” of David’s royal house. Those of the remnant class who continue faithful until their change into his complete likeness will share fully with him in that glorious dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.—2 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God early made manifest his rule, from which he will never deviate, that those who have faith in him and who walk with him in the way of righteousness and obedience to his command, shall be rewarded by being delivered from the enemy and being given the blessings of life. Enoch lived amid great temptation in the days of Enos when Satan began his scheme of reproaching Jehovah by mockery and religious hypocrisy. Hypocrisy, the fruit of wickedness, is from the Devil; faith is a gift from God and, when exercised, it is pleasing to God. Enoch manifested reverence for God and faith in him, and was delivered. The goodness and mercy of the Lord endureth for ever. His loving-kindness is marked by his every act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the whole earth.—Isa. 28:22, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s exhibition of divine power against the enemy at Armageddon will seem a &quot;strange act” to all on earth except those in harmony with him; hence, as the remnant puts forth its utmost effort to give the witless to God’s enemies, many may and will scoff and call them foolish. Many of the scoffers may include those who claim to be God’s children. But the true and faithful children of God will hear and heed and stand firm on Jehovah’s side. Never would it be possible for the anointed ones on earth to bind Satan and overthrow his organization; Jehovah God must and will do that. But the remnant will sing to the Lord’s glory, and will do so joyfully, while Jehovah fulfils his &quot;decree of destruction”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.-Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s law prohibited nakedness amongst those who approached his altar and served in his temple. (Exod. 20:26; 28:42) In the Laodicean church he rebukes some for being naked. (Rev. 3:17,18) The members of the temple class must therefore keep on the wedding garments which the Lord has provided by doing his service in his approved way. It is a time of great peril. All must now be on the alert and ever watchful. They must stand firmly on the Lord’s side, taking advantage of every opportunity to serve Jehovah by showing forth his praises. With gladness and joy they will declare his doings amongst the people. Herein lies the safety of God’s remnant today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, using diligence to preserve the unity of the spirit by the uniting bond of peace.—Eph. 4:1,3, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If friction occurs in the Lord’s organization, something is out of order. If each one were willing in the interests of unity to sink his own individuality, his good name, fame and reputation, and his high selfrespect, and to exalt the name and cause of Jehovah above everything else, he would joyfully perform the part assigned to him, and all would be kept in the uniting bond of peace. God’s organization is a unity; he himself is not divided, and his work is not divided. In giving counsel, therefore, one who would be a good counselor will not stir up division with a view to his own self-interest, but will look to the interest of God’s anointed ones. God commands his service to be done in this day, and manifestly any one opposing service work is not walking in a manner worthy of the anointed’s calling and the Lord will duly gather him out of the kingdom class,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out.-Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pillar suggests a support, a fixity, or that which is permanently placed. The temple is now become God’s fixed and permanent organization, and those who overcome and receive God’s approval are fixed as a part of that organization; they support and uphold that organization by being faithful representatives of it. Thus continuing to do, they “shall go no more out”. God’s Word identifies such, saying: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” As pillars in his temple, they shall abide there, because “they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever”. God’s organization is now established, and he will protect it and from henceforth will not permit Zion to suffer injury. Thus preserved, all of the temple class continue to say: “Blessed [praised] be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why dost thou judge thy brother? . . . for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 14:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us remember that the Lord’s servant is not accountable to man, but is accountable to his own Master. If we see our brother in Christ serving the Lord and having the Lord’s manifest blessing, then let us bear in mind that it is not our prerogative to judge our brother. The Lord has assured us that those faithful to Jehovah will be the targets for the darts of the enemy. The fact that a Christian patiently continues to serve God and to receive God’s favor is the best evidence that the charges against him are false and are laid against him by the adversary. Who may properly lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? “It is God that justifieth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.-John 17:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus had committed to his faithful followers a work to do relating to the preparation for the new government of righteousness, which work was a glorious privilege and for Jehovah’s glory. God had anointed Jesus to be the world’s invisible Ruler, and Jesus’ words indicate that he desired his faithful disciples to be associated with him in that rulership. The ‘oneness’ that Jesus mentioned means that Jehovah God is the great “King of eternity”, that Jesus Christ is the King to rule in Jehovah’s name, and that those who would be made one with him and his Father would have some part in that government of righteousness and thus be one with God and with Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.—Ps. 50:5, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This gathering began after the Lord’s coming to his temple in 1918. These saints are God’s “men of lovingkindness” because, being devoted to him, they are objects of his loving-kindness. They have something to do with assembling themselves together. They gather themselves out from those constituting the “great multitude” and from “the wicked” or evil servant class, and gather themselves unto Zion, God’s organization. God does not arbitrarily bring them into the place of special favor. The called ones must meet his requirements for them and hence must be “workers together with God”. Appreciating their covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, they are willing volunteers, joyfully offering themselves to the Lord for his service.—Ps. 110: 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Let the unjust one act unjustly still.—Rev. 22:11, Biaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word above rendered “unjust one” means a wrong-doer, an offender against right, or one who has become wicked and who is therefore the very opposite of righteous. None could be of that class unless at one time he had been made righteous through the blood of Jesus. Later he offends and becomes offended and walks in iniquity. Jesus told of such a class of persons, who had been accepted in the Lord and were in line for a place in the kingdom, but who at the end of the period of sacrifice are gathered out of the kingdom class. He also described an “evil servant” class who smite their fellow servants and who are assigned to the place occupied by the hypocrites. On coming to his temple Christ Jesus takes account with his servants, and finding such unfaithful and unprofitable ones he disapproves them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And Elisha the son of Shaphat, of Abel-meholah, shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Ki. 19:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Elijah had the Lord’s spirit there can be no doubt, because Elisha desired to receive a double portion of that spirit and did receive it. The Scriptures do not disclose any anointing of Elijah, but do fully disclose that he had the Lord’s spirit. It may well be said, then, that Elijah represented God’s anointed who earnestly and zealously engaged in the church’s work during the Elijah period. Not all the consecrated, however, did thus during that period of time. Since Elijah was commanded to anoint Elisha, it may be consistently said that Elisha foreshadowed that God’s anointed ones would have and manifest the larger measure of the Lord’s spirit during the Elisha period of the church’s work; also that it is God’s anointed ones who during the Elisha period of the church do the work unto the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High.-Ps. 92:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words are part of a psalm written expressly for the sabbath day; they therefore show Jehovah’s approval of publicly proclaiming his praises on the day which his professed people have set aside for the worship of God. But “it is good to sing praises unto our God” any day. Those who sing unto other gods can not say such a thing, because “good” means that which is of lasting benefit and good things proceed only from Jehovah, the Most High. “For it is pleasant; and praise is comely.” (Ps. 147:1) This means that the singers have much cause, not only to be happy, but also to be joyful in the Lord; and to them it is delightfully sweet to sing. Appreciating the favor of God and that it is fitting, beautiful and beneficial to sing praise to Jehovah, they give thanks and are not able to keep back songs of praise to his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.—Isa. 49:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul quotes this prophetic utterance and applies it to the church. (2 Cor. 6:2) This is proof that the body members of Christ are a part of The Servant and they, together with Christ Jesus the Head, are given “for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth”. It also proves that the body members will participate with the Head Jesus in the administration of the new covenant. The apostle also shows that the prophecy has an application to the body members during the time of the selection and development of the church. In that time they are members of The Servant and are ambassadors for Christ to preach the message of reconciliation. Therefore they should see to it that they “receive not the grace of God [this great favor from God] in vain”, says the apostle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called.—1 Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has committed his truth to the trust of his righteous, faithful ones. He reveals his truth in a progressive way, like “the light of dawn’’. By following its progression the trustful Christian walks in the light. He is admonished to be ever ready to give a reason for his hope. That reason must be based upon God’s Word, and not upon science and philosophy so called. God’s children must walk in faith, and faith results from hearing and understanding God’s Word and then confidently relying on that Word. There is no room left to quibble about whence the truth must come. Jesus said, “Thy word is truth,’’ and that by that truth the consecrated ones must be sanctified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The whirlwind which Ezekiel saw in vision pictures the divine indignation expressed against Satan’s organization. The four living creatures which emerged from the symbols of destruction seem clearly to picture the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font7"> factors of God’s complete organization. The four wheels seen correspond to the ancient fourwheeled chariot. High above the four wheels and the cherubim’s heads was a firmament, and above it was the likeness of a throne on which a glorious person sat. Taken together, the living creatures and the inanimate instruments give the appearance of an enormous living chariot-like organization; it pictures Jehovah’s mighty organization moving into action just prior to the great battle of Armageddon, and upon which God rides and over which he presides. God’s “remnant’’ is a part of this divine organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. . . . And let him that is athirst come. And . . . take the water of life freely.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“God is a spirit.” “With [him] is the fountain of life.” He has now commanded a great witness to be given that he is God and Christ Jesus is his anointed King. To his invitation, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” the remnant joyfully respond. But within the confines of organized Christianity is a “great multitude” of prisoners who thirst for the truth because there is no divine truth within their prison walls. By radio and by calling at the prisoners’ doors, the remnant of the bride class bear to them God’s gracious message. They hear and come and their thirst is quenched and they are made glad. They in turn tell their neighbors to come if they will and drink of the water of divine truth and take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. Such a course leads to everlasting life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The faithful have nothing to do whatsoever with the judgment and punishment of the wicked. That belongs to God, who does it through his great Priest who is now in his temple. But the faithful see the judgments of the Lord and rejoice because they are right. “Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.” The course of those described by the apostle is wicked because they repudiate the Lord and the redemptive blood whereby man is purchased and do despite to the light that came to them by the truth and through the holy spirit. However, those in “the secret place” can have and do have a vision or understanding of these things, and they have nothing more. Their safety is made certain because they abide in Christ Jesus their Advocate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The enemy organization now makes war against the remnant of the seed of the woman Zion. The anointed must now learn and take heed that to understand and appreciate the unfolding of the truth one must walk in meekness and humility before God. He must recognize that the truth is the Lord’s and not man’s, and that God is not pleased with those who attempt to exalt themselves or to give glory to the name of men. Long centuries ago God prepared some precious things to be revealed “in that day” to those who love him. We are now in that day, and therefore his anointed recognize that day and rejoice in it. Those who love God and who prove it by their works will eat at his table and will now rejoice in the great privilege of cooperating in the work he is doing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord has been glorified as King, and this honor attaches to the remnant of God’s saints on earth because they are ambassadors of the new King; and therefore they are now in glory. In view of the fact that the kingdom was set up in 1914 they “sing unto the Lord a new song”. They sing upon their beds instead of going to sleep, as some have done. They are active in showing forth the praises of Jehovah day and night, and will continue until earthly sleep overtakes them. This harmonizes with the words of the prophet (Isa. 62:6,7), wherein the Lord says that the watchmen of his organization, Jerusalem, shall not be silent day nor night but shall continue to make mention of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">All that has been begotten by God overcomes the world; and this is that victory which overcomes the world,—our faith.—1 John 5:4, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not an easy matter to overcome the world. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">child “begotten by God’’ must take a firm stand for the Lord and refuse to be influenced to compromise the Lord’s Word and his cause with the world. To resist Satan and the influence of his emissaries requires a course of vigilance and constant fighting. In so doing the Christian suffers much tribulation. The fact stands that Jesus had to overcome the world and did so; and it follows that all who will share the government with him must likewise overcome. Only those who have faith, constancy, fidelity, and continue faithful unto God can overcome the world. They will be bom in Zion, God’s official royal family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.—Rev. 22:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One’s being brought into God’s temple and “under the shadow of the Almighty” is no guarantee that he shall continue there. To remain there he must prove faithful by keeping God’s commands. The specific command given to God’s “faithful and wise servant” class is to preach “this gospel of the kingdom” as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">witness, and to this elass also Jehovah plainly says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” To continue in the Lord’s favor and to enter finally into the kingdom and receive the right to the tree of life, they must keep on fulfilling God’s commandments and thus prove their love for him. Blessed are they if they so do and thereby meet the test placed upon God’s temple class. It is to sueh overcomers that the privilege is to be given “to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God”.—Rev. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: . . </span><span class="font7">. Ye </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">are my witnesses, saith the Lord.—Isa. 43:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has been long-suffering with his enemies. Now the time approaches for the great issue to be for ever settled. Jehovah himself will settle the controversy and settle it righteously. The Devil and all his henchmen shall be judged, and all slanderers and liars against God and his people shall be put to shame. Jehovah now flings his challenge to the enemy, demanding them to bring forth their testimony to prove their claims or else to admit their defeat. At the same time he says to those of his “servant” class: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” In this crisis, therefore, God has a few who must take an unequivocal and uncompromising stand on his side and offer testimony to his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.—Dan. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeing that the taking away of the daily sacrifice and the setting up of the desolating abomination were fully accomplished facts in the latter part of January, 1919, the period of 1290 days or three years and seven months had its beginning there and must end with the beginning of September, 1922. At that very time in 1922 God’s anointed people were permitted to announce that Christendom had openly declared unfaithfulness to Jehovah and had become abominable in his sight. That was certainly a time of encouragement, aid and comfort to the anointed of the Lord. All the consecrated throughout the earth who approved the action taken at the 1922 Cedar Point Convention were greatly benefited, aided and comforted thereby, which benefit proceeded from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Now he which stdblisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.—2 Cor. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The divine record is silent as to how much time elapsed from the ascension of Jesus until the ransom price was presented in heaven, but it is reasonable to conclude that the faithful eleven were begotten as God’s sons shortly thereafter but not then anointed also. It was at Pentecost that the holy spirit was poured out upon them and there they began to speak in various languages, explaining God’s Word. That clearly marks the time of the anointing of the disciples, and it was God who did the official act. The apostles were anointed for service, and they faithfully engaged in that service. This supports the conclusion that all who are anointed are officially designated for service to Jehovah. They are commissioned to preach to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">September 23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<sup>57</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, . . . their works do follow them.—Rev. 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Truly from this time forward the above words may be properly said. Surely this is the most blessed time that the church in the flesh has had. The anointed members thereof enjoy the unspeakable privilege of being workers together with God and his Christ. The Most High, speaking through his beloved Son, says, “Come.” The faithful remnant class join in the gracious invitation and say, “Come.” Thus the message is being proclaimed to those who have a desire for righteousness and truth. It must now be proclaimed; and the remnant class, serving Jehovah in his temple, see that it is their blessed privilege now to represent him and to lay down their lives in his service. Abiding in his service and in his secret place till death, they shall have an immediate entrance into the heavenly kingdom and be indeed blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: for . . . he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.—Isa. 61:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This rejoicing clearly coincides with the fulfilment of Isaiah’s prophecy (vs. 1-3) concerning the anointing, and shows the anointing of those who are approved by the Lord upon examination at the time of coming to his temple. The chosen and anointed ones, now counted as a part of &quot;the bride’’, rejoice and magnify the name of Jehovah and have part in the fulfilment of the prophecy written: &quot;The spirit and the bride say, Come.” (Rev. 22:17) There is every reason, therefore, why the approved ones should rejoice at that time, because they have the testimony that they have been chosen and have received the anointing of the Lord and been commissioned to represent him. The robe of righteousness is the insignia of their office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">September 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(H9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Gal. 6:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new creature is made of willing earthly material in the hands of Jehovah God; that is to say, the exercise of the man’s will power leads him to completely and fully surrender himself to do God’s will. Thereafter his mind is transformed as God’s spirit operates upon it. During this transformation process the human organism in which the new creature functions is counted righteous by Jehovah through the blood of Jesus presented in heaven in the new creation’s behalf. Circumcision, uncircumcision, or one’s general physical condition, or the kind of clothes one wears, counts for nothing; but the body of the new creature must be used to God’s glory and will be so used in proportion to the measure of the Lord’s spirit possessed by the creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moreover, it is required in stewards [of the mysteries of God], that a man be found faithful.—1 Cor. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There does not appear to be anything in the Scriptures to show that one who has received the anointing in Christ falls back into the “great multitude” class by reason of the fact that he has lost that anointing. Saul was anointed as king of Israel. He was unfaithful and cast off by the Lord, but the Scriptures do not say that he lost his anointing because of unfaithfulness. As to what is the fate of those who are unfaithful after having received the anointing may be inferred from the Apostle Paul’s words. (Heb. 12: 29; 10:31) Surely greater responsibility and obligation is laid upon those who have responded to God’s call, been chosen and anointed, than upon those merely begotten of God. Any compromise by the anointed ones with any part of the enemy’s organization would be at least a degree of unfaithfulness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain.—Zech. 10:1, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The faithful until 1918 continued to hurl the hard-cutting truth against the bulwarks of the enemy. In that year Satan, through his agents, retarded the witness work. Did the revelation of truth stop there? Have God’s lightnings no more flashed since then? True, that was a time of discouragement, but the faithful waited upon the Lord and prayed to him for refreshment like “the latter rain”. The Lord heard the cry of his people and granted unto them their hearts’ desire, giving them greater light. God alone who makes lightnings is responsible for the rain which symbolizes his truth. Thus Jehovah rewardeth the prayers of his faithful ones, and none others obtain and hold the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, and thresh, 0 daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many people.—Hie. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah did not leave his people without instruments with which to thresh the enemy. He has brought into action the radio, by which means the message can reach the “prisoners” in the Babylonish systems as well as the ears of the clergy who sit behind closed doors. By proclamations and resolutions and by the publishing and wide distribution of booklets and books many of the enemy’s organization have suffered punishment. God has caused his message to be put in such form that it can be used with direct effect. He has furnished his people with iron horns to push against the enemy; he has shod them with brass hoofs; for the message, although one of peace and good will, has also served to beat in pieces the influence of ecclesiasticism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.—Ps. 147:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God literally does the above things. However, this scripture seems to have a symbolical meaning and fulfilment as well. Figuratively, clouds represent the presence of Jehovah and his Christ, in this, that both God and Christ Jesus are now giving special consideration to the anointed ones on earth and are also shaping earth’s affairs for the final overthrow of the evil world. As rain refreshes the earth, causing it to rejoice, so rain symbolizes the downpour of truth which Jehovah now showers upon those faithfully serving him. This message of truth being carried to the people enables them to see that there is hope for everlasting life on earth for them, and on this message of hope they feed; this, then, is symbolized particularly by the growing of grass upon the mountains and the flocks and herds feeding thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">There shall arise false Christs if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.—Matt. 24:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ words prove that at the end of the world and about the time of his coming to God’s temple, there would be false Christs. Since “Christ” means the anointed of God, false Christs would mean those who would claim to have the anointing but who in fact had not received it. “The very elect” means those chosen and anointed and commissioned to give the witness on earth; and these are the ones whom the false Christs would attempt to deceive by themselves claiming to be the anointed of the Lord. John warns the elect, saying: “Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists.” Such antichrists would be claiming to work in Christ’s name, but their work would not be according to God’s Word in announcing his kingdom and magnifying Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 71:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who rejoice in the joy of the Lord are wholly and completely on his side. He is their God, and their lips sing unto him and to none other. They refuse to sing any song that would pleasingly entertain the enemy or any part of Babylon’s organization. An example of this was set by the Jews when captive in Babylon. Asking the Israelites to sing a song of Zion, the Babylonians said in effect to them: ‘ Forget your past; come and be one of us and let us be at peace. Sing your songs for us.’ But the Israelites preferred to be smitten with muteness and paralyzed in hand rather than compromise with the enemy organization. So today, God’s faithful remnant know no such thing as compromise with the enemy, but on all occasions they sing and bear witness to Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was.—John 7:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David, whose name means “beloved”, was a type, foreshadowing Jesus, the beloved Son of Jehovah. David was born at Bethlehem. Jesus was born at the same city. Bethlehem means “the house of bread”. Jesus said concerning himself: “I am the living bread which came down from heaven.” Upon that bread all must feed who will get life. David brought the people of Israel up to a state of prosperity. He not only had the desire to feed the people, but possessed the ability, and did so. (2 Sam. 6:19) Jesus Christ is now clothed with all power and authority, is wholly devoted to his Father, and is carrying out his Father’s purposes to bring all obedient ones of mankind into a state of prosperity. David was the hope of Israel. Jesus became the hope of Israel according to the spirit, and through his “house” he is the hope of all the nations of earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.—Isa. 40:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his due time the great loving God sent Jesus, his only Son, and by and through his sacrificial death opened the way that leads to immortality. That is a ‘narrow way’, because it is a way by sacrifice. The sacrificing is about done, and within a short time that narrow way will for ever close. The closing of the narrow way means, however, the opening of a wonderful way for the return of man to reconciliation with God, which way may be termed the King’s highway. It is that wonderful way provided for the benefit of man. Long centuries ago the great Jehovah God made provision for that highroad, and therefore its rightful name, The King’s Highway. Amid the desertlike condition of the world today God’s remnant are now pointing the people to that road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of sin the human race was plunged into the greatest depths of poverty, with no right or hope of ever enjoying the riches of life. Jesus the beloved Son of God enjoyed all the riches of life in glory with his Father in heaven. He looked down upon the poverty of humankind, well knowing that the wicked rebellion of Lucifer had brought such destructive poverty on man. He knew of God’s loving heart and of his purpose to reconcile man to himself. Jesus was willing to become poor that mankind might be made rich in life and happiness and brought into full reconciliation with God. Knowing this grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should declare it abroad to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Now is the due time for the people to see and understand the truth; and particularly to see that all the warfare amongst themselves, the conflicts between religious systems, and the crimes and wickedness that stalk about in the earth, all these unrighteous things originated in Satan, “the prince of the power of the air,’’ who has used the clergy and other agencies to turn the people’s minds away from God. The time is here for the people to see that Jehovah is their friend and benefactor. The trutli must be set forth as against the evil one and his wicked course, that men may know that Jehovah is God and his beloved Son Jesus is now on the throne as earth’s rightful Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.—Heb. 3:6, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s royal house occupies the most exalted place in all his arrangement and is next to the Eternal One and first in importance of all his creation. He has given Christ Jesus, his beloved One and who is Head of that house, a name that is above all others, himself alone excepted. He ordains that every creature shall bow to that name, and that the house and all in connection therewith shall be to the glory of God the great Creator. He has brought forth many from among men and made them his sons, and has set before them the opportunity of becoming members of his royal house. Some of such he has chosen and anointed, and in his own due time that seed royal will be his instrument for the blessing of all the families of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know dll things.—1 John 2:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Unction” means anointing. It is the false Christs and false prophets, that is, those claiming to be anointed of God but who have not the unction, that attempt to seduce and mislead the chosen or elect ones, even as Jesus foretold. But the anointed chosen ones see and understand the truth. John’s words foretold a separation going on during “the last hour”. It should be expected that there would be a separation then between those really devoted to the Lord and those who claim to be devoted but who do not show a zeal for his cause. Those going out from the anointed company would show by their course of action that they had not received the anointing or unction. The elect must guard against being deceived by such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy.—1 Pet. 1:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While in the flesh one can not be perfect in words or acts or even in his thoughts. If he says he can bring himself to the point of perfection where he has no sin, the apostle says, he deceives himself and the truth is not in him. (1 John 1:8) God requires perfection in love, and that means an unselfish devotion to God. (Col. 3:14) A new creature in the flesh can be perfect in that regard. When God calls and chooses and anoints one, that means that such creature is called and placed on the Lord’s side; henceforth he must be holy, that is, entirely and completely devoted to God and his righteous cause. He must be faithful to God, and that he can not be unless he is faithful to the commission which he has received by reason of his anointing by Jehovah’s spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“That day” is the Lord’s day, the beginning of which is marked by Jehovah’s placing his anointed One upon his throne in Zion and directing him to go forth and rule amongst his enemies. “In that day” Jehovah has duties to be performed by every one of his faithful saints. “In that day” every one of the temple class must speak of the glory of Jehovah. No creature is to be exalted in that day; no matter how prominent a person has been in the church, he is not to be exalted or praised, because Jehovah alone is to be exalted. Hence “in that day” the faithful ones hear and delight to obey the commandments of God, among which is this: “ In that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord,... make mention that his name is exalted.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.—Eph. 2: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Serving the Lord does not mean to meditate idly upon getting away from the earth and going to a place of rest. Service means work. Jehovah God is the great Master Workman. The new creation is “his work, having been formed in Christ Jesus for good works, for which God before prepared us, that we might walk in them”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(JDiaglott)</span><span class="font7"> Such are engaged in a good work and must be perfected while faithfully continuing therein. Jehovah’s commission to them requires that they show forth his praises by now declaring that he is God and that the day is at hand when he will vindicate his holy name. Those of the new creation, who trust implicitly in the Lord, will do this work; they will take real delight in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Sacrifice is simply an outward confession of inward devotion to God. It is not the sacrifice itself that is pleasing unto him. Sacrifice unaccompanied by obedience and a true and sincere devotion to the Lord, is a mockery. He who keeps the Lord’s commandments with a joyful heart, not complaining about such as being a burden, is the one that is pleasing to God. So it is not sufficient that we enter the covenant with the Lord by sacrifice. We must thereafter obey and prove our faithfulness by serving God and we must be found faithful upon his examination of us. We must perform our “reasonable service” toward him, being always prompted to obedience by love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Do not I hate them, 0 Lord, that hate theef ... I count them mine enemies.—Ps. 139:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some claiming consecration to the Lord reproach their brethren for speaking in strong terms against the hypocritical clergy. God’s Word makes it clear that such clergy are the children of the Devil, God’s enemy. Hence the clergy are God’s enemies, because they bring reproach upon his name. God’s enemies must be made the enemies of his children. The true child of God regards his Father’s enemy as his own enemy; being wholly on the Lord’s side he hates iniquity and the workers thereof and those that rise up against God. Any reproach upon our Father’s name is a dart of poison against us. Wherefore we could not consistently sing the praises of our God and at the same time show, even passively, favor or honor to God’s enemy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In order that the work of Jehovah, in these latter days of trouble and darkness upon the world, may be done, God has given his people a special measure of his holy spirit both of desire and zeal and of power. It is as a fire which consumes the bones: a zeal for the Lord which provides the fire to consume the sacrifice. (Jer. 20:9) The spirit of the Lord gives boldness in the witness against Satan’s organization. Jehovah is calling upon his people, whom he has raised up for the honor of his name, to witness for him and against the enemy and his organization. To do this his people must set their faces as adamant, for only the love of God will enable them to withstand the attacks the enemy makes upon them.</span></p>

Some of these stumbled at this Stone and fell; upon other resisting ones the Stone fell and ground them afe it were to powder. It is this Stone, to wit, God’s anointed King, that smites Satan’s organization, dashes it to pieces, and sets up God’s government of righteousness amongst men. Those who make the Lord their sanctuary stand the test and welcome and hail the Stone, the King, “with shouting, crying, Grace, grace unto it.”</span></p>

They are within Zion, which is Jehovah’s organization, and are protected by what is represented by the “gates” and “bars” which stand between them and the enemy and which have been strengthened now that Satan, cast out of heaven, makes war upon God’s remnant. God keeps his hand over them while they are in full view of the foe.

Overcoming can be done only by an unselfish devotion of oneself unto God and his King and by joyfully bearing the reproaches which the enemy easts upon him because of his faithfulness to Jehovah, and by completely cleansing one’s hands of everything that pertains to the Devil’s organization. To those who thus overcome Satan’s organization and its subtle and sinister influence belongs the above promise. The greatest privilege ever granted to creatures comes in this period of time. Jehovah has placed his Son as King upon the throne, and it is the faithful ones who overcome who will be permitted to occupy the throne with that victorious One in the kingdom which will bestow blessings upon all families of earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.—Ps. 50:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being Jehovah’s organization and his workmanship, Zion is “the perfection of beauty”. Since Zion is God’s official family or organization, Jehovah’s shining out of Zion must take place when that organization is functioning to the glory of God. “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. ’ ’ The building of Zion was from and after 1914, when Jehovah placed Jesus, the Head or chief one of Zion, upon the throne on his holy hill of Zion. God’s shining would necessarily mean the shedding of greater light upon his Word for the benefit of his organization; hence those of Zion now have increased light. The light proceeds from Jehovah and shines to his people by and through his beloved Son, the Head of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.—Matt. 24:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flood of Noah's time was typical of a far greater trouble shortly to come upon this world by which Jehovah will destroy it and will teach all his intelligent creatures that in him resides all power, which operates in precise harmony with wisdom, justice and love, and that the oppressed human race will find complete deliverance only through the mighty arrangement which he has provided for the eternal blessing of his obedient creatures. In Noah’s day only a few were witnesses for God. Now only those who truly love and serve Jehovah God with pure hearts are really on his side. It is to the faithful remnant that Jehovah now says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Millions of people of good will throughout the land are in distress, longing to see a better day but not knowing which way to turn for relief. To them the world is as a parched desert where there is neither food nor water. The remnant bring to them the glad message of today, telling them that they may now take their stand against Satan and for Jehovah and receive God’s blessing. Such a class of people, now seeking meekness and righteousness, may be hid in the day of Jehovah’s expressed wrath, be carried beyond the battle of Armageddon, and live for ever and not die. Those who would finally be part of Christ’s bride must notify the people that soon the great highway to life will be opened. This must be done in order that all who will may take the water of life freely by siding with the Lord and responding to the requirements of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.—Rom. 8:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God foreknew the new creation, and predetermined that the members of it must be like the Head thereof. To be conformed to his image does not mean to be like him in the style of one’s hair or clothing or the tone of voice or the carriage of the body. Jesus was supremely devoted to his Father’s cause, and each member of the new creation must, like him, be absolutely devoted to Jehovah and his cause. Each Christian knows that he can not act, speak, or even think, perfectly; but he does know that he can be completely dedicated to God and refuse to be on any terms with the Devil. In this respect his likeness is that of Jesus, and this is the likeness that was predestinated and is now required.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Already Jehovah has shaken the heavens and ousted Satan, the false god, therefrom. His forces are gathering for the great and final shaking of the earth. When he thus exercises his irresistible power, nothing shall stand before him, for no god is like unto him. The Scriptures show that some will take the side of Jehovah amidst great opposition while Satan the mimic god assembles his own unto himself for the final decision. Already the company of God’s anointed has made its decision; publicly and in convention assembled it has thrown down the gauntlet to the Devil and to his adherents by declaring against Satan and for Jehovah. It is a declaration of war from which God’s anointed remnant will not retreat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly. —1 Thess. 5:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is holy, because all his ways are right. Christ Jesus is holy, because of being always in harmony with Jehovah in doing his will. The members of Christ’s body must be made holy, or sanctified, like unto their Head. They must be wholly devoted to God, and Jehovah supplies all their needs to that end. Being adopted into the Lord’s royal family, they are set aside for Jehovah’s service. Now they must be wholly dedicated to God. In the new creation, The Christ, Jehovah will have a nation and people unalloyed in their devotion to him and who will refuse to sympathize with even any part of the Devil’s system. The end of their sanctification will be their crowning as kings with Christ Jesus in his throne.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lo, a great multitude . . . stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, . . . and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.—Rev. 7:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “great multitude’’ of spirit-begotten ones, as they feed upon God’s Word and grow stronger and learn that “the harvest is past’’ and that they can not be of the kingdom class, will take a determined stand on the Lord’s side, though to do so means to pull down Satan’s structure on their own heads. But they will resolve to die as witnesses for the Lord. They will ascribe their salvation unto Jehovah God and unto the Lamb of God. In the very final and crucial test they prove their faith in God and suffer death. They die in the great time of tribulation and will be raised to heavenly life. Let every child of God who is really devoted to him and his cause proceed in this crucial time to carry the message of deliverance to those now held in “prison houses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Yea, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Job 37:11, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “cloud” in this text does not represent trouble, but the presence of Jehovah. This text shows that God illuminates the cloud with his lightnings, thereby meaning that his presence is accompanied with light to those who seek to know him. Lightning brightens and reveals that which was previously in the dark or obscured. Symbolically, God’s lightnings illuminate his Word for those who wait upon him, and reveal and expose that which is opposed to God and his organization. Therefore it will be observed that the text tells of God’s lightnings flashing at a time when Jehovah manifests his presence to his people, giving them greater light upon his Word, revealing his purposes toward them, and also exposing their enemies. Jehovah is the source of the lightnings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the judge standeth before the door.—Jas. 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord is not standing and knocking at the door of each individual. This warning has reference to his coming to his temple, that is to say, to his own house. He knocks to see if his servants are awake and diligent. He comes to judge his own house and to take account with his servants. Some servants he finds watching; they quickly respond to his knock. Others are indifferent. Those who are so blind that they can not see that the Lord has come to his temple are also so deaf that they can not hear his knock. They can not enter into his service unless they are aroused and get their eyes open. It seems certain that the Lord uses those who are awake and zealous to call the attention of the others to their privileges today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant.—Ps. 89:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The everlasting covenant between Jehovah and his chosen One is that Jesus should have life, immortality, -a throne, a crown and a government. David being a type of God’s beloved One, this covenant could not be applicable to Jesus until at his anointing he became “the seed of David”, within the Scriptural meaning. Thenceforth all the prophecies of the everlasting covenant enured to Christ Jesus. At Jesus’ resurrection that covenant was confirmed to him. He is the One in whom this great covenant is fulfilled; and in his unselfishness toward his faithful followers he covenants and agrees to take them into the kingdom with him. Devotion and obedience unto death is required of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For the time is at hand. ... He which is filthy, let him be filthy still.—Rev. 22:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is well known that there are those who were in the Lord’s service, but who have neglected their obligations, repudiated the Lord and his truth, and returned “to the weak and beggarly elements [rudiments]” of the world and joined Satan’s organization. At the time when they came to the Lord they left the Devil’s system and were then transferred from darkness into the kingdom of light. But later through selfishness their understanding became darkened and they turned themselves to lasciviousness and uncleanness, like “the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire”. Jude describes the same class, who “what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves”. It is at the time of coming to his temple for judgment, when his reward is with him “to give every man according as his work shall be”, that the Lord expresses the above judicial decree against such as have repudiated him and have become filthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.—Ps. 119:129.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord has placed his testimonies in the hands of his anointed ones. That is a privilege conferred which can not he overstressed. Satan has erected monuments as a testimony to the deeds of merit performed hy his servants, hut these monuments shall perish for ever. The Lord’s testimonies are righteous and founded for ever. (Ps. 119:144,152) They are the most wonderful of all, and blessed is he who has them and keeps them and who has part in declaring them. Those who are approved as faithful witnesses will be received by Jehovah. They will stand in his temple for ever as pillars or monuments of testimony unto him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Him that called us by his own glory and virtue. Tea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue.-2 Pet. 1:3,5, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The one who is called of God must </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font7"> something more than merely have faith. He must use diligence in furnishing, in supplying, the things the apostle mentions, the first thing mentioned being virtue. The word here translated “virtue” means manliness in Christ Jesus, valor or fortitude. The Christian, having engaged to become Jesus’ follower, takes his stand on God’s side; and there he must stand firmly, with valor fighting for the cause of righteousness and refusing to compromise in any manner with Satan or any part of his organization. There must be no wavering now; having taken his position on Jehovah’s side, he should remain stedfast unto the end. He </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font7"> do this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God is my strength, . . . and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.—Hab. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To have a part in joyfully proclaiming the kingdom tidings as Jehovah’s representative means to engage in the greatest campaign ever held under the sun. At this time the peoples of earth are groaning under the oppression of their governments. There is no government that is satisfactory to any nation or people. Man is at his wit’s end. It is therefore the time of God’s opportunity to have his anointed make proclamation to the people that the time of their deliverance through God’s glorious kingdom has come. He who fails or refuses to avail himself of this opportunity is not walking on “high places”, but is missing the grandest privilege ever offered to man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. —Rev. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord warns the lukewarm to buy of him. How can the spirit-begotten ones buy from the Lord ? Evidently by paying to the Lord the price that the Lord requires, to wit, by joyfully keeping the commandments that specifically apply at the time when the Lord is at his temple. Some will wait until too late to do their buying. Buying gold tried in the fire surely must mean obtaining that which comes through fiery trials. The rule is definitely fixed, namely, “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” Undoubtedly the Lord’s words mean to buy divine approval by following in his steps, serving as he served, and receiving the reproach that he received by reason of faithfulness. A good name with the Lord is gained by a whole-hearted devotion to the kingdom interests committed to his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies; for false witnesses are risen up against me.—Ps. 27:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David, “thesweet psalmist of Israel,’’foreshadowed Christ Jesus and the members of his body. Hence the above words, which he wrote as God’s prophet, apply to The Christ. Satan induced false witnesses to appear against Jesus. Jesus’ disciples may expect the same thing because the servant is not above his master. Other scriptures also warn true Christians that they may expect false witnesses to rise against them, even from amongst those who claim to be their brethren. It is not strange, therefore, that false witnesses should arise in this day and condemn those who are putting forth their best efforts to bear witness to Jehovah’s name. But even though such enemies should kill God’s faithful mouthpieces, the Lord’s testimony will go on just the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In this description the “remnant”, who strive for the heavenly birthright, are shown in the midst of the people as dew from the Lord and as showers upon the grass. These words indicate comfort and blessings to the people, and may be taken to indicate that some of the present “remnant” will be on earth even after Armageddon is fought and will then have some more work to do in the name and to the praise and glory of Jehovah. The people having passed through the terrible trouble will no longer look to men for help nor watch for the sons of men to offer aid and comfort, but will turn to Jehovah and gladly hear his Word. Some servants of the Lord will be privileged as his agents to bear the message of life and peace to the people.—Deut. 32: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.—1 John 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His beloved Son was the great delight of Jehovah. But God is entirely unselfish, which means that God is love. He would forego himself the delight and daily communion with his beloved Son in his immediate presence, that he might recover man and at the same time prepare his beloved Son for the loftiest position of rulership. Hence, to execute his purposes, and because of his love for humanity, God sent Jesus to earth to die in behalf of the sinful race. Thus God would first save the race from destruction and then establish over it a theocratic government that mankind might be fully recovered to human perfection and fully enjoy that perfect government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s coming to his temple in 1918 marked the beginning of tests upon God’s people and the falling away of many who claimed to be in the covenant with God. However, those continuing to stand stedfast and fixed in the Lord, i.e., to ‘wait’, have been so marvelously blessed. The 1,335 days equal three years eight and one-half months. This length of time after the 1,290 days had ended in September, 1922, brings us to the middle of May, 1926. Ever since that time until now has been a “blessed” time for those who are in Christ. God’s lightnings have revealed to his people a clearer vision of his purposes, and he has continued to feed them upon his Word, and they, showing diligence in his service, have enjoyed the blessed assurance of his love and approval.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When Jehovah, as represented by his beloved Son, his anointed King, came to his temple to inspect those invited to the high calling, he found some who were disorderly, and these he clears out of his temple. Order is one of the hardest lessons for creatures to learn. A deflection from God’s way is displeasing to him. A wilful and deliberate going contrary to the Lord’s appointed way is treason. Humility means to be submissive to God and to follow his appointed ways. Humility is the very opposite of pride. Surely those who had taken off the wedding garment or who did not have it on when the Lord came to his temple, would not receive the Lord’s approval and would therefore not share in the anointing of his spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ.—1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus said he came to minister. A minister is one who is clothed with power and authority to represent a higher power or authority and who attends to the duties of his office and renders service. He is the representative of a government or power, an ambassador performing service in his official capacity. His authority is limited by the commission received from the one appointing him. Paul said: “I am made a minister, according to the stewardship of God which is given to me for you, fully to declare the Word of God.” (margin and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font7"> The true minister of God ministers not in his own strength but in that of the Lord, and he seeks to represent Jehovah faithfully and to glorify him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord God is building an official habitation for himself, which is Zion; and those of Zion may therefore have no fellowship or friendship with the enemy organization. The exceeding great and precious promises given to such were made with a definite purpose in view, namely, “holiness unto the Lord.” The adversary has made many Christians believe that all that is required is to clean up oneself from bodily and mental filthiness. But the apostle goes further and points out that there is something additional to such cleansing, namely, “perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” This means an utter separation of oneself from everything that has to do with Satan’s system, and an unqualified espousal of Jehovah’s will and cause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The faithful remnant, trusting in Jesus’ blood, anointed by Jehovah’s spirit, and counting not their lives dear unto them, are joyfully giving the testimony, and by the Lord’s grace they will overcome the enemy. They fear no evil because they are “under the shadow of the Almighty”. Perfect love has no fear of man or Devil, but he who has perfect love and absolute confidence in God boldly proclaims the truth as a witness in the name of the Lord. Jehovah will take into his government and make official members thereof only those who prove that they love him and his King more than their own lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Thia commission to the six men with slaughter weapons, who represent the incomplete anointed class on earth, became applicable when the Lord came to his temple. God’s remnant must fulfil this commission, not with carnal weapons, but by the use of the spirit of God in declaring the day of his vengeance. In so doing they must not imitate King Saul when he was sent to slaughter the Amalekites utterly. They dare not say: ‘The mean and contemptible things of Satan’s organization we will denounce; but the respected things of Christendom we will spare, because this will result beneficially to us and we shall not become obnoxious to the many respectable people of the world.’ The remnant must spare no part of the enemy system, but must obey God’s orders completely.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus.—Eph. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The honor and glory to be enjoyed by the saints in the resurrection is not essential to God’s purpose, but is a great favor conferred upon them and is an acknowledgement of their faithfulness. Manifestly Jehovah’s purpose has been to afford to those willingly obedient to his Word an opportunity to prove themselves as his faithful representatives in the world and thus not leave himself without living witness in the earth. Though not of the world, they are in the world to bear testimony to the name of the true God. To them Jehovah has offered the opportunity to be made conformable to Christ’s death that they may partake of his glorious resurrection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Why then were animals ever sacrificed? It was as an expression of Jehovah’s loving-kindness for man, teaching him how God would duly open the way for man’s complete reconciliation and that the basis for such reconciliation would be the sacrifice of life. God has proceeded gradually and gently to teach and lead men, knowing that when men come to know him and his good purposes toward them they will love and obey him. Hence the sacrifice of dumb animals merely foreshadowed the sacrifice of a life in man’s behalf but did not foreshadow the nature of the one who must be the real sacrifice. That one was “the man Christ Jesus’’. Animal sacrifices being unavailing, he came to fulfil the pictures they foreshadowed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.—Ps. 117:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has used human instruments at different times in making known his truth, but the truth has always been and always will be Jehovah’s. The Bible is his Word of truth, given to guide those seeking God’s righteousness. The truth-seeker is not left to guesswork, nor obligated to rest his conclusions upon man’s opinions; but, having the Scriptures and knowing them to be God’s Word and therefore right and absolutely true, he can prove every doctrine that is offered. God has preserved his written Word of truth, the Bible, against every attempt of Satan and his agencies to destroy it. Now it is God’s time for the truth to be known, and nothing Satan can do or will do shall prevent God’s eternal truth from being known. The tide of truth will continue to rise until it fills the whole earth as the seas fill the deep. All this shall be to the glory and praise of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">As one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.—1 Cor. 7:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was unfaithfulness on the part of some of his creatures that made it necessary for God to sacrifice his beloved Son; and now, having called out from among men those who shall be associated with his beloved Son in the reconstruction of the world, it is certain that God will require of all those absolute faithfulness. That means, therefore, that although one is begotten of God, is called, chosen, and anointed by and with the spirit of Jehovah, yet before his exaltation to membership in God’s royal house such creature must prove his faithfulness to Jehovah and to Christ. Faithfulness can not be too greatly stressed. The promise of glory and exaltation is only to the faithful. To the called, chosen, and anointed it is said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. ”—Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 12:6,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font7"> purposed to have a new creation which would be marked by “holiness unto the Lord” and be ever faithful to him. In no way could he prove this creation except by putting each member of it to the severest test. By suffering, Jesus was subjected to the test, and his faithfulness and obedience earned for him the title “Faithful and True”. To be exalted with Jesus the body members of The Christ must first meet the same test as he did. Their sufferings are not for the purpose of providing a purchase price or a sin-offering, but are for their own profit, that they might partake of glory, honor and immortality with Christ Jesus. This is a loving provision for them on the heavenly Father’s part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The real meaning of these words of the Anointed One could not be understood until after he had come </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">his temple and this truth was flashed to God’s watching ones like lightning. By “the gospel’’ he meant the good news furnished by the fact that the world had ended and the time had come for Jehovah’s righteous government to be put in operation. Thus the Prince of Peace has given to his younger brethren </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">positive command that must be obeyed; and all who love him and love God will keep this commandment and, keeping it, will have God’s special favor. Keep</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font7">this commandment means to engage in the wonder</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ful </span><span class="font7">work which God is now doing in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manifestly God’s messenger here refers to the Lord’s coming to the temple, from which time forward the Lord has taken account with those who have made </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">covenant with Jehovah. It is during this time that he renders ‘to each man according as his work is’. All those who confess the Lord’s name and to whom he has committed his goods or kingdom interests are under examination and being put to the test. This is why in the preceding verse the Lord says: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy [devoted wholly to the Lord and diligently caring for the kingdom interests], let him be holy still.” All this shows that the time has arrived for the judicial decree to be rendered by the One authorized by Jehovah to judge, which One is Christ Jesus. We must all appear before his judgment seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her.—J er. 51:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth,” is that devilish and wicked organization, symbolized by the evil &quot;woman” or &quot;great city”, that has long ruled over the nations and kingdoms of the earth. (Rev. 17: 5,18) It gives birth to the wicked government, both visible and invisible, which rules the kingdoms of men. As the term Zion is properly applied to God’s organization as a whole and also to the members of the body of Christ, even so the name Babylon is properly applied to the Devil’s organization as a whole and also to the members of the official family of that wicked organization. It is now time for God’s anointed ones to declare hi§ vengeance against Babylon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.—Jas. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words indicate that the brethren would be surrounded by darkness until the presence of the Lord, and then his presence would be manifest by the coming and increasing of the light. The physical facts show that the light began approximately in 1874 and increased from that time forward, marking that as the beginning of the time of the presence of the Lord. God was there turning his face to his saints; and there Christ Jesus began giving special attention to gathering them out of Babylon preparatory to bringing them into the temple condition. This does not mean, however, that since the Lord’s coming to his temple Christ’s brethren have need no longer to exercise “patient continuance in well doing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Praise thy God, 0 Zion. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fat of wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 147; 12,14, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those faithful to the covenant by sacrifice and under the robe of righteousness are at peace with each other. They see eye to eye on the great truths revealed to them from God’s Word, and are watching carefully for the interests of God’s kingdom. Unitedly they carry forth the message of Jehovah and lift their hearts and voices to him in harmonious song. To give them strength thereunto Jehovah fills them with food, like the sweet and nourishing portion of the wheat. Not only does he give them the Word of God for food, but he graciously shows them the meaning thereof that it may be exceedingly nourishing and strengthening to them. Those who engage in quarrels and disputes feed upon the husks and do not understand the truth and can not rejoice in the precious truths now being revealed to God’s remnant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.—Eph. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the ambassadors of Christ on earth would now be in bonds except that God is shielding them until their ministry is done. An ambassador is one appointed by a higher authority to represent that higher authority in a foreign country. Jesus was such when he came to earth to do a work in his Father’s name. God was then and there speaking through Christ his message of reconciliation, telling the people how man can be reconciled. He spoke boldly as God’s Ambassador, and for this he died. His death constitutes the ransom price, and this, presented as a sin-offering, constitutes the atonement for man’s sin. The truth of these great facts must be boldly declared to the people now by Jehovah’s ambassadors on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.—Rom. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Present,” as here used, means “to stand alongside ; to be at hand ready to serve; to assist and bring before and yield up”. The Lord’s Word does not say, ‘Sacrifice your bodies,’ but, ‘Present your bodies as a sacrifice. ’ Jesus, the High Priest, will do the sacrificing. Our reasonable service under the terms of the covenant by sacrifice is to use all the powers with which we are endowed in behalf of the Lord’s cause, and therefore to be at all times on the alert to obey his will. Our bodies are counted alive as the new creature’s organism, and hence we must see to it that the use to which they are put is in harmony with God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">November 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<sup>156</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am . . . the bright and morning star.—Rev. 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long before Jesus’ above words Jehovah caused the prophecy to be uttered: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel.” (Num. 24:17) This prophecy refers to Jesus as earth’s rightful Governor and could not have its fulfilment until he was sent forth to rule amidst his enemies. Hence this prophecy synchronizes with our Lord’s words in the text above as to time of fulfilment. The morning star is a sure harbinger of a bright and glorious day. It appears in the east shortly before the dawn breaks, giving forth its soft and pleasing light and cheering those who watch for the new day. The early watchers see it and are glad. “Star” figuratively means prince. (Strong) Hence Christ Jesus, “the Prince of Peace,” is appropriately “the bright and morning star”; for on his shoulder the government of righteousness shall rest. He has already taken his power as King. Therefore he sends this testimony unto the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.—Matt. 13:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words show that the ones gathered out were for a time counted in as the anointed; otherwise they could not be brought out from the kingdom. They are gathered out because they become offensive to the Lord’s manner of carrying on his work. By refusing to do the Lord’s work as he commands, such “do iniquity”, become lawless. God’s present message points so clearly to what true Christians must now do as regards announcing the kingdom, that it offends the selfish and self-willed; thereby they are shaken out. Instead of trying to get men into heaven, Jehovah is shaking out all who can be shaken, that thus the approved ones might be made manifest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are ye, when men shall . . . reproach you, . . . for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy.—Luke 6:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of his zeal and loving devotion to the work which God had given him to do, Jesus was reproached by the Devil and his instruments, particularly the ecclesiastics. Likewise today reproaches are hurled at those who love and advocate God’s kingdom of righteousness, and this is done generally by the religious element. Suffering such reproaches is another means of identifying those who are prospective heirs of the kingdom. God permits these reproaches for the purpose of testing and preparing the kingdom heirs and also as a proof to them that they are his. Those thus suffering should greatly rejoice, for great is their reward in the heavenly government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel.—Isa. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaiah and his sons represented the elect, the ones whom the Lord has chosen. At the time of the vision of the Lord in his temple Isaiah “heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me”. At this point Isaiah undoubtedly represented many of God’s people who had not been active in proclaiming the message of God’s truth; but now having received cleansing and God’s approval and the anointing, and hearing the Lord’s voice and receiving the command, those represented by Isaiah go and do the things mentioned in God’s commission to them. The anointing is not only an appointment to an official position, but a commission of authority to do the things designated therein. The anointed are God’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.—Ps. 50:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures and physical facts prove that Satan and his angels have been cast out of heaven, and therefore all who are in heaven declare the righteousness of Jehovah in taking this action against the evil one and his host. A voice from heaven says: “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.” Now Jehovah’s righteous judgments are being made manifest in the earth. His judgment has already begun at the house of God: “for the Lord shall judge his people.” All those professing God’s name come under this judgment; namely, those faithful to the “everlasting covenant” for the kingdom, the “great multitude”, and the “wicked” or “evil servant” class. Jehovah now whets his glittering sword and his hand takes hold on judgment, and shortly he will render vengeance on all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath anointed me to preach . . . the opening of the prison to them that are bound.—Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This prophecy, which Jesus applied to himself as fulfilled in him at the beginning of his ministry, makes a clear distinction between the anointed and those who are to be served by the anointed. That prophecy, having a fulfilment upon Jesus then, is also fulfilled upon his body members, and particularly upon “the feet of him”. Those who are included in this prophecy as anointed members of Christ’s body are commissioned to preach to others, among whom the “bound” ones, or prisoners, are specifically named. Manifestly those thus designated as “bound” are not of the anointed. Other scriptures make it clear that the “prisoners” are spirit-begotten and are held in the prison houses where they cry unto the Lord; and that the anointed ones are commissioned to carry to these prisoners the message of consolation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">4s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.—Rev. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must be that the course of action taken by many of the consecrated ones in this Laodicean period is lacking in zeal for Jehovah, and for this reason God’s “Faithful and True” witness says the above words to them. Why should the Lord call upon any one except the sons of God to be zealous </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font7"> Why should he counsel any one to repent or change his course of action unless by so doing he could be brought into full harmony with him and into the favor of God? Beyond a question of doubt the above message is addressed to those who have received a knowledge of present truth but who have failed to show a proper appreciation thereof. A test is therefore put upon them. It is the duty of each one of the anointed to manifest the zeal peculiar to God’s house of sons.—Ps. 69: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land.—hfic. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Undoubtedly “the Assyrian” is one of the names of Satan’s organization. The Assyrian, the Devil and his agencies, attempts to invade the citadel of the temple class and to destroy and break down the members thereof. (Rev. 12:17) While the enemy makes the assault upon God’s anointed ones, the great “Ruler” is the peace of the remnant. He is the “Prince of Peace”; he comes as Jehovah’s Executive Officer to establish peace. But first he must make war and overthrow the enemy. The remnant side with him and follow him because he is the Head of Zion and Jehovah’s great Priest. The remnant trust him and are at peace. He is their Redeemer and King, and they have complete confidence in him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the spirit, unto obedience.—1 Pet. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God sanctified his Son Jesus by the spirit to be the Head of the great government of righteousness which he would establish. Before he would exalt him to the high position of actual rulership God would prove his beloved Son by letting him be subjected to the most severe trials. The persecutions that were heaped upon him afforded the opportunity for him to learn obedience. By these experiences Jesus did learn obedience and proved his worthiness to be fully and for ever entrusted with the work before him. His course emphasized the lesson God would teach the new creation: that obedience is of the greatest importance if they would be exalted in the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.~Joel 2:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fulfilment of this prophecy implies the anointing of God’s begotten and chosen ones by the holy spirit. The prophecy adds: “Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, . . . your young men shall see visions.” The clear inference from this is that there should be a better understanding of God’s truth, and that those understanding it would engage in telling the message to others. Hence it seems Scriptural to conclude that during the period of the Elijah work a comparatively small number of those begotten of the spirit received the anointing, and that with the Lord’s coming to his temple the Lord’s spirit was poured out “upon all flesh”, even upon all who had received the Lord’s approval and who were therefore chosen. All so anointed were commissioned to prophesy or preach.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah now reveals his will faithfully and truly unto his anointed ones, and they see that a witness work is to be done and must be done amongst the peoples and that it must be done “shortly”, that is, speedily. There is now no time for delay. “In that day it shall be said ... to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.” Jehovah now bids those having hearing ears to come and learn the way of life and to walk therein. Those who would continue to be of the servant class, and therefore of “the bride”, must now say, “Come!” Such will keep on inviting the people to take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Such now see that God’s anointed King is upon his throne and that “the Lord is in his holy temple”, and they enthusiastically say, “I will sing praise to my God while </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">have my being.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Praise thy God, 0 Zion, He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.—Ps. 147:12,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Snow is pleasant and beautiful to the eye, but it is cold and cheerless; wool is warm and comforting and brings soft ease and peace of mind. To some the truth looks cold and uninteresting, but when understood it makes them warm of heart. As for the hoarfrost, it is bright, but it is hard frost that has become so by reason of age,- it is very cold and cheerless. Some of the people to whom the truth is now being brought have been in contact with “Bible religion” for years and have found no joy therein, and at first the truth also seems to be cold and without cheer to them; but when the truth is examined and explained to them the situation changes and the frosty condition melts away just as ashes fly before the wind. For all this the children of Zion praise Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return of her with righteousness.—Isa. 1:27, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Malachi’s prophecy shows that the coming of Jehovah ’s Messenger to his temple marks the beginning of the time of judgment. Then applies the scripture: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. ’ ’ It follows that the remnant who gather themselves unto the Lord and who make up Zion must be the first ones judged. Jesus' words (Matt. 25:23) show that these are first judged, and only after being found good and faithful servants are they made a part of the Lord’s temple and do they therefore form a part of Zion. For such Jehovah provided the sign of his approval, the robe of righteousness, and Christ Jesus brings the approved ones under it, thus beginning a time of rejoicing for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. —Rev. 19:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We must not infer that God has not always governed his obedient creatures. There is no record of the beginning of the exercise of Jehovah’s sovereign power. In fact, the Scriptures speak of the priest Melchizedek, “priest of the Most High God,’’ as picturing Jehovah’s executive officer carrying out the divine will at all times; and of the beginning of his days there is no record. But the new and righteous government of earth has a definite beginning. Imperfect man will not make the laws for this new government, as is the custom with human governments. The new government is a pure theocracy; it is God’s government by and through his beloved Son Christ Jesus. Through this government Jehovah, the Lord God omnipotent, reigns. Furthermpre, “Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater.—1 John 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past sixty centuries testimony has been given for God by faithful men; but when Jehovah comes forth to give the final witness he will become the Chief Witness. When his testimony is given, all creation will know that Jehovah is the true and living God and that Satan and his minions are liars. Before Jehovah shall the wicked perish. Then in the eyes of every creature who loves righteousness Jehovah will stand as the greatest, the “true and faithful witness”. (Jer. 42: 5, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.

<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s remnant, the heirs of the heavenly birthright, will go on to triumph in the strength of Jehovah. “The righteous are bold as a lion.” (Prov. 28:1) The lion is a monarch among the beasts of the forest, and none can stand before him. A flock of sheep or herd of goats is without power against a strong, young lion amongst them. Thus the faithful remnant of God is described by the prophet. Amidst the nations of many peoples these shall be strong and vigorous in the name of Jehovah, to assist those who want help and to point out God’s method of destroying those that resist his power and arrangement. God’s power will be exercised, and all enemies of his people shall be cut off.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 4:25; Rev. 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No human being at present is righteous within himself. When one trusts in Jesus’ blood and makes a vow to do God’s will, and God receives and justifies him, only then is he counted as righteous. There is a great multitude of those who have consecrated to do God’s will and who, being justified, were brought forth as new creatures; but they hold the truth selfishly, looking to the time when they might receive profit thereby. They have sought to make themselves righteous and have overlooked and neglected keeping God’s commandments faithfully. If ever such are to live on any plane of existence, they must maintain that righteousness which is due to justification. They can maintain it only by holding to the faith in Christ Jesus. Concerning such less faithful ones, but who are Still righteous, Christ Jesus on coming to his temple for judgment says: “Let him be righteous still.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 62:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s anointed servant class is gathered into a oneness in order to tell harmoniously concerning his doings. There could not be several ways of proclaiming the message of truth. Those composing the watchmen Upon Jerusalem’s walls “see eye to eye”; and each one, together with the others, lifts up the voice and sings. This does not mean merely telling to people the purpose of God as it pertains to the past, present and future, but it means to tell what Jehovah is doing at the present time. Many marvelous things are now happening in the earth, and it is the duty and obligation of God’s servant class to tell the meaning thereof to every one who will hear. The people must be told that a knowledge of Jehovah and obedience to his will is the only way that leads to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.—Heb. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be tempted means to be put to a test. Jehovah had anointed his Son Jesus to be Ruler, and before permitting him to reign God would prove his Son by a severe test. Jesus had always been true to his Father, but now he was anointed to be God’s great Prince and King to rule the world; hence God would prove his Son by actual experience. If Jesus would prove his faithfulness and devotion to God under trial, he would prove himself entirely worthy to be trusted with the great authority and power as Ruler of the world and with the possession of the divine nature, immortality. Therefore God permitted Satan to apply the test, and God saw to it that that test resulted to his own praise and glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The “wise” are those who apply their knowledge according to the divine standard and who apply themselves joyfully to the service of the kingdom interests committed to them. To them God’s kingdom is everything, and they make everything in life subservient to it and its interests. Though all Christians have had their Bibles, “their lamps,” and have studied them some, only the wise ones have understood and rejoiced in the prospects of the kingdom of God being established. These latter awakened to their privileges shortly after 1918. They rejoiced in the tribulations permitted by the Lord and, being delighted at the Bridegroom’s coming, they hasted to serve him with joy.</span></p>

When about to cast off the Jews, he used Jesus and the apostles to serve notice, particularly upon their rulers. In each case he chose as his witnesses men who were devoted to him. And now, when God would complete his great work in establishing his righteous government which shall crush all of Satan’s organization, he causes notice to be served upon the peoples, nations, and kings. He chooses not the selfish and presumptuous to do this work; it is the “remnant” by the Lord’s grace that carries on the work.</span></p>

Sinee “Christ” means the anointed of God, it is manifestly true that no one can properly be termed a Christian who is not in Christ and who has not received the anointing. Strictly speaking, then, it is only those who are in Christ and anointed of the Lord and who remain stedfast to the end that can be called Christian. Hence the “lukewarm” ones in the church must be warned, that those who do arouse themselves may also receive the anointing and enter into the work which the Lord has provided for the “faithful and wise servant” class, the class upon whose shoulder the Lord has laid “the key of the house of David”, as foreshadowed in the case of Eliakim.-Isa. 22: 20-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">December 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<sup>48</sup>)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Even now many have become antichrists; . . . and you have an anointing from the Holy One; you all know it.—1 John 2:18,20, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unfaithful who go out from under the Head Christ Jesus line themselves up on the side of the antichrist. The faithful, however, know that they have received the anointing through the Head of The Christ, and that he received it from Jehovah; that therefore an obligation is laid upon them to do and perform certain things; that the anointing constitutes their ordination or commission to preach; and that there is no other rightful ordination. In the performance of the divinely granted commission they must faithfully represent and declare Jehovah’s name, his anointed King and his kingdom. They keep themselves unspotted from the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city.—Rev. 22:19, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time now makes manifest a selfish class who become dissatisfied with the spiritual food which the Lord provides for his devoted people and who take no pleasure in obeying his commandments. In effect they say: 'There is no more truth to be revealed. We must now quietly wait until we are taken to heaven. We will have nothing to do with the service.’ They refuse to join with “The Spirit and the bride” in saying, “Come.” Thus they take away from God’s words his commandments that the witness must now be delivered and that by a faithful class whom Jehovah calls his “remnant” and “witnesses”. Having left their first love, and failing to overcome, they lose the promise of receiving any right to the tree of life. There must have been a time when these could have had a part in that tree; but now they can not be part of God’s holy city or his glorious kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me ... to proclaim . . . the opening of the prison to them that are bound.—Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “prisoners” are not anointed, but they are the begotten children of God and are held “bound” in the religious prison houses. They see the unrighteousness there and cry unto the Lord, and he hears their cries and expresses his determination to deliver them. (Ps. 102: 20) He has provided the printed message concerning his kingdom and has also provided the radio as a means of telling the prisoners the truth, and then he sends his anointed messengers from door to door to further comfort such prisoners. The Lord has laid upon his anointed ones the obligation and privilege of thus proving their faithfulness unto him and to the commission of their anointing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.—Isa. 26:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is written: “When the wicked rise [since 1918], men [of the body of Christ] hide themselves.” The command to the saints to hide themselves in the inner chambers could not apply prior to the Lord’s coming to his temple. It is in “that day” of God’s indignation against his enemies that the place of safety is provided; and, since we are entering that great and terrible day, the place of safety must now be available. The inner chambers, or place of security, are provided for and made known to those who have received the robe of righteousness since the Lord came to his temple. Manifestly the “little moment” that they are to hide themselves therein is the “short time” that Satan knows that he has to prepare for and to fight the battle of Armageddon. Only those who discern God’s lightnings flashing since 1918 see that there is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">place of safety and hide themselves therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Whoso offerefh praise glorifieth me: and to him that disposeth his way will I shew the salvation of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 50:23, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is those who joyfully sing the praises of Jehovah God and who give glory to his name, doing it out of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">pure heart unselfishly, that are pleasing unto him. Taking their stand unequivocally and firmly on Jehovah's side and boldly bearing testimony to his name, they prepare the way by which Jehovah may show them his salvation. They see and know no God but the Most High. They are on his side, determined to stay there, and they delight to voice their praises unto him. Be it noted, therefore, that the ultimate salvation of the “remnant” now depends upon constant and faithful devotion to Jehovah God in performance of the covenant by sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.—1 Pet. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a Christian sees that by suffering according to the will of God he has the opportunity to prove to Jehovah that he is faithful and true, he delights to have that opportunity, regardless of what causes the suffering. When he sees that the world is Satan’s organization and that from it comes the opposition, then he extracts joy from his sufferings. The sufferings do not deter him, but he continues patiently in well-doing, serving his Creator, and commits to his Maker the responsibility of preserving him while so doing. He does not try to run ahead of the Lord by seeking a course which will relieve him of the sufferings, but persists in the Lord’s service until the Lord delivers him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And the angel . . . gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of God.—Rev. 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having already ousted Satan from heaven and destroyed his rule there, we may know that God will destroy his rule and influence on earth. Such is one of the preliminary works of God’s righteous government. In that work of destruction Christ Jesus leads the assault. He alone is the wine-press that crushes the life of the vine of the earth, Satan’s evil organization. The part in this great work that the faithful disciples of Christ on earth perform is that of process servers. They serve warning by informing the rulers and peoples of earth concerning Jehovah’s intention through Christ Jesus to destroy the adversary ’s world organization in the battle of Armageddon,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to me.—Col. 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus on earth was charged with the ministry of God’s Word. He was God’s Apostle and Ambassador. He declared that God’s Word is the truth and that he must tell it to those who would hear. He was faithful to God who appointed him as his minister. The anointed ones are also God’s ministers; and all such faithful ones constitute the Servant of God, of which Jesus is the Head. Paul was anointed as a member of Christ’s body. Paul did not sing the praises of other men, nor did he seek to exalt himself in the eyes of men. The true minister or servant of God gives attentive heed to what Jesus did on earth, and, like Jesus, he seeks always to faithfully represent God and to please him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.—2 Pet. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The condition precedent to partaking of the divine nature is that the one in the covenant by sacrifice fulfil his part of the contract. He can not fail if he has the things mentioned by the Apostle Peter. These things are faith, fortitude, knowledge, self-control and constancy in the performance of duty, and God-likeness or holiness, brotherly affection, and love. Demonstrating these things with diligence is the prime essential in the performance of the new creature’s part of the covenant. His organism, the body of flesh, must serve Jehovah. Thus carrying out his contract, he is certain to have an abundant entrance into the official part of God’s righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus . . . was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 3:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ exaltation was higher than all others of God’s creation, and aside from Jehovah none other will ever be so high. That exaltation was not because of something Jesus had developed within himself, such as a character separate and distinct from himself; nor was it because of what he had done before he came to earth; but it was because of his fidelity, as a man on earth, to Jehovah in the faithful performance of his covenant and his duties and obligations laid upon him by his Father. It is from this viewpoint that Christ’s younger brethren who are called to share the same high exaltation are exhorted to consider Jesus, Jehovah’s great Ambassador.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 17:14, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many, begotten of God, have not responded to the “high calling”. Those who have responded and who have been chosen have received the anointing of the holy spirit. Such must be entirely out of sympathy with the enemy’s beastly organization and must be entirely devoted to Jehovah. In pointing out Satan’s organization these anointed ones bring against themselves the expressed indignation of the enemy and his agents. But let it be remembered that it is Satan’s organization that makes war upon the King of kings, and they that are with Christ the Lord in the war, and also in the victory, must not only be of the called and chosen but also be of the faithful in the performance of the commission of the anointing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David.—Rev. 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David, the son of Jesse (&quot;living one”), was anointed to be ruler over natural Israel. He foreshadowed Christ the King. David was bom in Bethlehem; Jesus also was bom there, and concerning him it was written: &quot;But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, . . . out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.” Though this prophecy had a miniature fulfilment when Jesus as a man came out of the literal town of Bethlehem, its complete fulfilment was deferred &quot;until the time that she [Zion] which travail-eth hath brought forth”. The birth of the &quot;man child”, representing the new government or new nation, seems to be the key to the matter. (Mic. 5:3) It was in 1914, therefore, that the prophecy was fulfilled by Christ’s coming to rule; and in 1918 he presented himself as King and Head of Zion. Then it was that Jesus became the rightful inheritor, as the &quot;root and offspring of David”, of the promise made to David concerning the everlasting throne.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God loveth a cheerful giver.—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He who receives from the Lord must give if he would grow. He who receives the truth and continues to hold it must serve it. If he receives it and makes use of it for selfish purposes he makes no progress and has no real joy. The faithful receive the truth with joy, and with greater joy they give it out to others. They delight thereby to honor the name of the great Giver. It was Jesus who said: &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive.” To receive the truth brings gladness of heart; but to tell it out to the praise of Jehovah brings even greater joy. The sacrifice of the anointed ones is “the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name”. They cheerfully give forth such praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.—Rev. 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any spirit-begotten one opening the door and actively joining God’s “watchmen” and enthusiastically entering the service in whatsoever way the Lord opens to him will receive Jehovah’s favor. Each individual of God’s household of sons is responsible to take such action as quickly as he is aroused. Opening the door to the Lord is an act of service to the Lord in obedience to his commandments. The door is the opportunity, and the obedient ones grasp it quickly. The Lord compels no one to enter his service. He needs no one, but he gives the signal announcing that he is at his temple and that the time for service is here, and then lets each individual accept or reject the opportunity. The individual embraces it by unselfishly doing all he can to proclaim the Lord’s message. The Lord comes in and sups with such.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The word “justifieth” here used has no application to the justification received by one at the time of consecration. The word is here applied primarily to the Lord Jesus (v. 6; Matt. 27:26; 26:67), but applies to all the new creation, and signifies approval. Jehovah alone will pronounce approval on those who are his; no one else has the right so to do. He will approve those who please him, regardless of what man may think, and such he will help. Therefore let no true child of the Lord be disquieted by slanderous reports against his brethren and condemn these brethren. God will judge each one according te his perfect judgment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The true child of God will not look for help or strength from any creature. He will not hold to some supposed truth merely because some men taught it. He fully appreciates that the truth is from Jehovah, ‘'the God of truth,” and that God causes his light to shine upon the Word of truth in his own good time. On the other hand, the child of God is not disturbed by the strength of man exercised against him. He fully appreciates the force of the statement, ‘‘If God be for us, who can be against us ? ” He does not stop to look about amongst princes or men for help; but with full faith and hope in the Lord God he goes sted-fastly on with his duties in the service of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Thess. 4:7; Rev. 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Lord came to his temple and began reckoning with his servants, he approved those who were diligently caring for the kingdom interests committed to them. These had shown an appreciation of the fact that they had been brought into the body of Christ and had been anointed to do a work in the name of the Lord. They received the truth and held it in the love of the truth and sought to glorify God. They devoted themselves wholly to the Lord. Such were covered with the robe of righteousness and brought into the temple condition. But this is no guarantee that any individual shall remain there. To abide in the temple condition and in the secret place of the Most High, one must prove his faithfulness by holily obeying God’s commandments. The Lord’s judicial decree concerning such is: ‘‘Let him be holy still.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation. . . . Praise ye the Lord.—Ps. 147:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s people are here represented by Jacob and Israel. God shows his Word and his will to those who have pledged themselves to serve him, especially at the present time. For this reason he gives his temple class from time to time flashes of lightning illuminating their minds and disclosing what he wishes them to do. They constitute the people or nation called for his purposes. Never before has he dealt with any people or nation as with them. Great and unequaled is the privilege that God’s “holy nation” now enjoys. His statutes and commandments to engage in his present glorious work in the earth have never before been properly known, and no other nation aside from the “holy nation” has ever been invited to participate in carrying them out. For this they greatly rejoice and together they say to one another: “Praise ye the Lord.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font2">HIS journal is published lor the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as tho fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all these things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 45: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has made provision for the reconciliation of the human race to himself. When this is done the proof will be conclusive that he can put men on the earth who will maintain their integrity with him. He appointed Christ Jesus his beloved Son as his Minister of reconciliation. The redemptive price was first provided by the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus. Then God proceeds to take out from amongst men a people for his name and upon which people he puts his name and which people must stand for his name as his witnesses to show forth his praises. That is the work preparatory for his kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Long before the ransom sacrifice was given, and since the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus, and during the period of time the kingdom is in preparation, crimes, calamities, gross wickedness, malice and injustice have held sway. It has been a long dark period of suffering and distress. Many have asked the question, Why has God permitted all this trouble and distress? The answer given and held as true by the followers of Christ Jesus for many years is in substance this: ‘God has permitted man to have a long experience of sin, sickness, sorrow and death that he might for ever learn and know the exceeding sinfulness of sin; that man has thus gained by practical experience a knowledge of the exceeding sinfulness of sin and also furnished an illustration to the angels; and that there is no better way for teaching the needed lessons than by experience.’ Such conclusion could not be true because entirely out of harmony with God and his Word. Sickness, sorrow and death came upon Adam as a just punishment for his deliberate violation of God’s law, and all mankind have suffered by and through inheritance the result of that wrongdoing on the part of Adam. The evil that therefore befell Adam was right and just and did not teach Adam any lesson whatsoever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Because Satan has defied Jehovah God, reproached his name and put at issue his Word, God has not restrained Satan in his wicked course but has permitted him to go the limit and until God’s own due time to demonstrate to all creation that he is the only true God, that his Word is true, that his name is worthy of praise, and that by and through him is the only way to obtain life and attending blessings. He could not have permitted the reign of wickedness for the purpose of teaching man by experience the exceeding sinfulness of sin and to furnish an illustration to other creatures. To do so would make God a party to the great wickedness, which is impossible. The question is therefore pertinent: Have the peoples of the world learned any valuable lessons by reason of the practice of wickedness or evil or of suffering, sickness, sorrow and death?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WORLD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The proper answer to that question must be in the negative. From Abel to the flood wickedness reigned, and out of all the people that lived in that time only two men were approved by Jehovah, and they learned nothing by reason of evil. Of them it is written in God’s Word that both Enoch and Noah were counted righteous because of their knowledge and faith in God.—Heb. 11:5-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Following the flood men organized themselves into forms of government and Satan the wicked one became their god. He exercised controlling power over them. From the flood to the coming of God's beloved Son the people had learned nothing by experience with evil. The greatest crime of history was committed by the religionists of that time by the murder of the Prince of Peace. The Jews suffered a terrible drubbing at the hands of Jehovah as a just punishment for their wrongdoing and they have learned nothing by reason of their experience with evil. The entire Christian era to the present hour has been one of the practice of malicious crime and gross wickedness, and the only ones that have learned any valuable lessons in that time have been those who have obtained some knowledge of God and who have been diligent to obey his Word.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">147</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Standing at the very end of the world we see the earth drenched with the greatest amount of human blood unrighteously shed that ever flowed and the earth cries out for vengeance for the shedding of such blood. With it has come the reign of wickedness in the land that has long boasted of its freedom and liberty. So greatly has crime increased in this land that the president of the United States has truly said: “Life and property are relatively more unsafe in the United States than in any other civilized country in the world.” Let any one who contends that the world is growing better, and that the human race has learned anything by experience with sin, come forth with the proof or for ever hold his peace. Not cne scintilla of proof can be produced that even tends to establish as fact that the human race has learned a single valuable lesson by experience with sin or the practice of evil or wrongdoing. There is no reason to conclude that during the reign of Christ the race will profit by the long reign of wickedness; because then the people will want to forget such wickedness, and those who have the Lord’s blessings will put such things out of their minds and fill the mind with that which is proper and right.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> Have Christians ever learned any valuable lessons by reason of experience with evildoing ? In the period of time known as the Christian era, and during which time God has called and gathered his church, wickedness and wrongdoing have reached the superlative degree. Those who have been taken into the covenant with Christ Jesus have suffered indignities at the hands of others, particularly at the hands of the religionists and fanatics and those who claim to'be followers of Christ but who in fact are the servants of Satan. The greatest indignities imaginable were heaped upon Jesus Christ and he suffered much evil, all of which was wrong. Likewise the disciples suffered at the hands of the same class of persons that persecuted the Master. Every true follower of Christ Jesus has been the target for cruel and wicked darts of the enemy and has suffered much persecution. This is exactly as the Scriptures foretold conditions would be. And who has been the instigator of all such evil wrongfully inflicted upon the followers of Christ Jesus? Surely not Jehovah. Satan is the one, because he has hated and hates every one who serves God and honors his name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> It was Satan, the god of this world, who attempted to kill the babe Jesus and who continued his wicked persecution of Christ Jesus throughout all the days he was upon the earth. Jesus told his followers that they would suffer evil through the same agency, and all his followers have thus suffered. By coming in contact with evil, have the Christians learned any valuable lessons therefrom concerning the exceeding sinfulness of sin? Most emphatically, No. In spite of the evil and in resisting the influence of the -wicked one they have learned to be faithful to God and to maintain their integrity. It was not the experience with evil, however, that taught them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Why then has God permitted Christ and his body members to suffer evil at the hands of Satan and his agents? For the same reason that he permitted Satan to beset Job with so much persecution. Satan had defied God and ridiculed his name and word and declared that God could not produce a creature that would endure suffering and still maintain his faithful devotion to Jehovah. God has permitted Satan to afflict those who had declared their devotion to him in order to prove that Jehovah is right and righteous and that man can be faithful to God and hold fast his integrity under the most adverse conditions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The Scriptural account of and concerning Job is conclusive proof of the truthfulness of this statement. Referring to the list of faithful men mentioned in the Scriptures from Abel to John the Baptist the record is that every one of those so named suffered indignities at the hands of Satan and his agents. The reason therefor was because those men had declared themselves on the side of Jehovah, and Satan beset them in an attempt to turn them away from God. They learned no valuable lessons by reason of evil, but they did learn in spite of that evil and against evil to be faithful and true to Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> But is it not written: “We [followers of Christ] are made a spectacle [theater or public show] unto the world, and to angels, and to men”? (1 Cor. 4:9) And does not that scripture prove that man has passed through events of evil and suffered evil as an object lesson to the world and to angels and to men that they too might learn the exceeding sinfulness of sin? Is this not proof that man has experienced evil as an object lesson to others? The answer must be in the negative. It is no proof thereof whatsoever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Clearly the argument of Paul is this: that he and others, as followers of Christ by reason of the covenant of sacrifice, are appointed unto death; that life everlasting of such depends upon faithfulness unto God and the holding stedfast of their integrity; that Satan and his agents continually assault such followers of Christ Jesus in an attempt to turn them away from God and cause their destruction and to ridicule Jehovah; that to the world, which is under Satan’s rule, those followers of Christ are foolish fanatics and the very offscouring of men; that to the evil angels and men they are fools. As further proof of this, Paul then adds: “We are fools for Christ’s sake”; that is to say, Because we hold fast to Christ as our Redeemer, Lord and Master, we are fools in the sight of the world and evil angels and of men who do not believe God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> These faithful followers of Christ stand out in bold relief as a company of fools and are the gazingstock of the unbelievers. This conclusion is further supported by Paul’s statement: “But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock, both by reproaches and affliction; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.”—Heb. 10:32,33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Instead of the world and evil angels and men learning any valuable lessons, they have brought increased reproaches upon the name of Jehovah. The world is Satan’s organization; and that organization continues to persecute the faithful ones, and the evil angels assault and attempt to debauch Christians, and men who are not of the worldly organization, and ridicule and reproach them. By the practice and carrying on of evil, therefore, no one has learned any valuable lessson concerning the sinfulness of sin, and only the Christian, in spite of sin and the practice of evil, has proven his devotion to God. Therefore the Christian, by the things that he suffers, learns obedience even as Jesus learned. (Heb. 5:8) Surely Jesus learned nothing from the practice of evil, yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered. From God’s Word the Christian knows that sin is the transgression of God’s law, and therefore wrong, and when he suffers wrong at the hands of others such suffering is not for the purpose of teaching him the exceeding sinfulness of sin but does afford an opportunity for him to prove his loyalty, faithfulness and devotion to God amidst persecution. Through this he learns to be joyfully obedient to God’s will under test.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CHASTISEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Is it not true that the Lord chastens his sons whom he loves and that he gives them this experience for the purpose of teaching them the exceeding sinfulness of sin ? The apostle answers: ‘ ‘ And have you forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons? My son, slight not the discipline of the Lord, neither be discouraged when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives. If you endure discipline, God deals with you as with sons; for is there any son whom a father docs not discipline?” —Heb. 12: 5-7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The Lord brought evil by way of punishment upon Israel, so he brings chastisements upon his sons in Christ who are negligent and forget the terms of their covenant. God is not responsible for their negligence. As he saw Israel going wrong and chastised them, so he permits chastisements upon his sons that they might learn to be obedient to him and the value of being faithful to him. The lesson he is teaching them is not the sinfulness of sin, but the value of faithfulness. Hence the apostle says: “The just shall live by his faithfulness.”—Heb. 10:38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EXPERIENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The statement, “Experience is the best teacher,” has become a proverb and has generally been held to be true. The statement is not true. Experience is not the best teacher. The best teacher is that which enables the student to learn the most valuable lessons. The English word “experience” is defined thus: “To actually live through an event or events; personal contact or acquaintance with a reality.” The peoples of earth have for six thousand years been actually living the events of sin and have had a personal acquaintance with sin or wrongdoing, and the greatest of all of those sins has been the turning away from, misrepresenting and reproaching Jehovah God. From such experiences the world has learned nothing that is good. At the end of the nineteen hundred years of the operation of governments and nations called Christian we find the leaders of organized Christianity, so called, repudiating God’s name and his Word and his beloved Son. These so-called Christian nations bring forth and stand sponsor for a devilish thing that is in opposition to God’s kingdom. There is more reproach brought upon the name of Jehovah today in so-called Christian nations than in any other part of the earth. The practice of evil has not caused men to shun wrongdoing. It is impossible to fill the mind with wrongful things and thereby learn that which is good.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> As a point of illustration: The peoples of the so-called Christian land of America have had ten years’ actual experience with the so-called prohibition law, and amidst it all wickedness has increased and the desire amongst men to be lawless has increased. Those who are the most ardent advocates of prohibition, instead of learning something good, have learned to approve the murder of men, women and children under the pretext of enforcing the law.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> But does not the Apostle Paul say with authority that the Christian learns by experience? He does not, as that word is generally understood. According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> of the Bible, Paul says: “And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit, which is given unto us. ’ ’—Rom. 5: 3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The word rendered “experience” in this text does not mean “the actual living through an event or events”, as that word is defined by worldly lexicographers and generally used. As used in the Scriptures it means approved or approval. A better rendering of the text reads: “And not only so, but we triumph also in affliction, knowing that affliction works out endurance; and endurance approval; and approval, hope; and this hope is not put to shame, because the love of God has been diffused in our hearts, through that holy spirit which has been given to us.”—Rom. 5:3-5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Clearly, the meaning of the scripture is this: That Christians, when persecuted or afflicted, triumph through such wrongdoing by reason of being in Christ and remaining stedfast and true to Jehovah God and to the terms of their covenant; knowing that such affliction works out patience (which means constancy in the performance of duty and continuing in so doing with an inherent joy, knowing that one is right and pleasing God), and such patience is evidence or proof of &quot;experience”, that is to say, approval by the Lord; and such approval increases the hope of complete victory; and that hope makes the Christian not ashamed, but bold for the Lord and the proclamation of his Word and Name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The mere fact that one passes through an actual event or events that cause suffering would not increase his hope. If, however, he suffers affliction for righteousness’ sake, and while so doing continues faithful to God and to his covenant, such constancy and faithfulness brings an inward joy, all of which is an evidence that he has God’s approval, and this increases his hope of overcoming and receiving tho crown of life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BEST TEACHER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> By what means, then, has the Christian been taught, and what is his best teacher? The Christian has learned valuable lessons by his knowledge of God and his Word and by the manner of God’s dealing with him. He might actually live through many events and by them learn nothing; but by the knowledge which he gains from the Word of God and God’s approval of his course of action, he is taught. The best teacher is Jehovah God; and those who are desirous of learning he teaches by his Word and by the manifestation of his loving approval of those who serve him. The knowledge of God, and loving obedience, is that which brings real profit.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> There are those who have made a covenant with God to do his will and who have a smattering of what God’s Word says. They content themselves by believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Redeemer of man and that God intends to save mankind by and through him. Their chief objective is to get to heaven that they might have a place of ease and honor. They are greatly deficient in a knowledge of God’s Word, and negligent in obeying what they do know. They have had experience with things evil by coming in contact with evil and evildoers, but they have learned nothing thereby that has brought them profit. To such the words of the apostle seem to be addressed when he says: ‘‘Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.”—1 Cor. 15:33,34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> It is impossible to know the will of God without studying his Word. Therefore it is written: ‘‘Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom. 12:2) All those today who have renewed or built up the mind by a careful study of God’s Word and a joyful obedience thereto now know' that the will of God concerning them at this time is that they must be his witnesses and sing forth tho praises of his name and do so boldly. Those without a knowledge of God’s Word are conforming themselves to the world by pursuing a course similar to that which nominal Christians have always pursued. Neitkei' their own experiences nor the experiences of those who have gone before them have taught them anything. Many of such have tried to develop what they call a sweet and beautiful character, expecting that such will get them to heaven. The Lord never so instructed. Obedience to his Word prompted by unselfish devotion is the principal thing. A man may be rude in his speech and be excused for that because of his imperfection. But there is no excuse for a real Christian to be deficient in the knowledge of God’s Word in this day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The Apostle Paul was diligent in acquiring a knowledge of the Word of God and his will and then doing it. He wrote: ‘‘Though I be rude [simple] in speech, yet not in knowledge.” (2 Cor. 11:6) Some must have accused him of being rude in speech; otherwise he would have had no occasion to use these words. For outward show many have insisted that a Christian should be diplomatic; but let it be remembered that diplomacy was invented and is carried on by the Devil, and not by the Lord. To his brethren Paul wrote with authority: “And this I pray, that your love may yet abound more and more in knowledge, and in all perception, in order that you may examine the differences of things; and that you may be sincere and inoffensive in the day of Christ. ’ ’—Phil. 1: 9,10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Diplomacy is not sincere. The truth spoken unselfishly in kindness and sincerity and with boldness is approved by the Lord. Paul further emphasized the importance of knowledge when he wrote: “Because of this also, we, from the day we heard it, do not cease praying on your behalf, that you may be filled, as to the exact knowledge of his will, with all spiritual wisdom and understanding; to walk worthily of the Lord, pleasing him in all things; bringing forth fruit by every good work, and increasing in the exact knowledge of God.” (Col. 1:9,10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott) </span><span class="font3">Paul sought the approval of God, and not the approval of men; and he emphasized the importance of being taught by a knowledge of God and his Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> As proof that it is not God’s purpose to teach men and angels by the experience with or observation of sin, wickedness or evil, it is plainly written: “This is good and acceptable before God, our Savior, who desires all men to be saved, and to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.’’ (1 Tim. 2:3,4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> All creatures that ever learn any lessons of value will learn them by reason of a knowledge of God and his Word, which Word is the truth. When Jesus prayed to his Father to sanctify his disciples he made no reference to their experience, but he did say: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) That the truth of God’s Word is the teacher is further emphasized by what Jesus said to the Jews: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31,32) The Jews had come in contact with sin time and again and had learned no valuable lessons. They had been drawn away from their covenant by the influence of Satan and his organization and were therefore in bondage to the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> It is so in this day, that manj- who profess to be the children of God are in bondage to Satan and his organization. All the experience they might have would teach them nothing of value, hut a knowledge of the truth of God’s Word and obedience thereto would teach them much.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> “The last days” are now here, as the Scriptures and the facts prove. There are those who have for a long while claimed to be in the covenant with God through Christ and yet fail to seek for a better knowledge of God’s Word. (Heb. 5:12) They continue to meditate only upon what is given first for the babes in Christ, although they claim to be learning, and are going over and over again that which they should have known years ago, “ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.”—2 Tim. 3:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> Their experiences have taught them nothing. But they might learn by acquiring a better knowledge of God’s Word and by unselfish obedience thereto. The importance of a knowledge of God as the chief teacher was emphasized by the apostle when he wrote: “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. ” (2 Pet. 1: 2, 3) That it is not experience that is important, but that the knowledge of God is important for all who would live, is conclusively proven by the words of Jesus: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. ’ ’—John 17: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>82</sup> There are only two other texts in the Bible where the word “experience” occurs, and these are here briefly considered. “And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry : for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.” (Gen. 30:27) Laban was dishonest and had been defrauding his son-in-law Jacob, who declared his purpose to leave, and Laban diplomatically used the words in the above text. The word there rendered “experience” means divination or enchantment. In other words, Laban said: ‘I have had a divine vision that when you are here the Lord blesses me. ’ That language was used to enable Laban to further carry on his fraud.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Solomon said: “I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” (Eecl. 1:16) Here the word “experience”, according to the Bible, means a vision or view, being an evidence of God’s approval. Otherwise stated, Solomon said that he had a view or a vision of God’s approval by the wisdom God had bestowed upon him. It should be remembered that that is exactly what Solomon prayed that he might have.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIANS’ EMPLOYING EVIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Is the Christian ever justified in employing evil in his action toward another? Having a proper understanding of the meaning of evil, to wit, that which brings adversity, affliction, distress or sorrow, and is hurtful, the answer to the question must be in the negative. Under no circumstance is the Christian justified in employing evil against another. “Recompense to no man evil for evil.” (Rom. 12:17) “Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.”—1 Pet. 3:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> It is not the prerogative of the Christian to punish the wrongdoer. Evil is properly administered against wrongdoers by the Lord or by any one whom the Lord delegates to act in his behalf, but it would be wrong for any one to assume to act without authority. “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves; but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” (Rom. 12:19) God has not delegated power and authority to the followers of Christ to administer punishment to others even though they are wrongdoers. God will attend to them in his own good time and way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> There are those who claim to be God’s children who indulge in speech against their brethren that tends to do their brethren much injury and bring upon them adversity and sorrow. The evil-speakers justify themselves in their evil speech by claiming that their brethren have done wrong and therefore should be properly held forth to scorn. Such is contrary to the Scriptures. God has made his organization of which there is a part on earth to which is delegated certain work to be done. All who are of God’s organization are responsible and answerable to him. Therefore the follower of Christ is instructed to “speak evil of no man”. (Titus 3:2) Under no circumstances is an individual justified in bringing sorrow, affliction, or suffering upon another by his speech or act. “Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standcth or fallcth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.”—Rom. 14:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>87</sup> The apostle gave wholesome advice to his brethren when he wrote: “Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”—Jas. 4:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> Jehovah has prescribed his rules of action for the government of his people. He has not delegated this authority to men. If a man attempts to render judgment or decision concerning another and his standing with God he therefore makes himself a judge of God’s law, which he is not authorized to do. He assumes to fill a place that is not his, and therefore his course could not be pleasing to the Lord. If convinced in his own mind that his brother is pursuing a wrongful course and is reprehensible before God it is his duty to avoid such a one, but never to punish him or attempt to punish him.—Rom. 16:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHURCH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Has not God delegated to the ecclesia or congregation of Christians the authority to render judgment and inflict punishment upon certain offenders and thereby bring evil upon them? The answer according to the Scriptures is No. God has not authorized an ecclesia to render a judgment for the purpose of inflicting punishment upon any one. Differences and misunderstandings do arise amongst imperfect creatures. Jesus Christ announced the proper code of procedure, and the only one that either an individual or an ecclesia is authorized to pursue under such circumstances. One becoming offended against his brother in the Lord may be approached according to the rule laid down. That docs not mean that the injured one may do injury to the wrongdoer. But he may do this: “If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.”—Matt. 18:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> What would be the purpose of bringing the matter of differences before the ecclesia? Manifestly that the ecclesia might hear the facts and determine who is wrong and then so advise the parties involved. It is not the prerogative of the ecclesia to render a judgment and enforce it against either one of the parties and thereby bring evil or punishment upon the wrongdoer. The purpose should be to aid the erring one, to recover him if possible, and to do so by taking a firm and unequivocal stand for the side of right. The ecclesia, by manifesting its disapproval or condemnation of the conduct of the wrongdoer, would be acting properly and might thereby awaken the wrongdoer to his improper course and enable him to recover* himself; and if he does so, and expresses his sorrow and strives to do right, then he should be helped.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> On some occasions the elders of the ecclesia assume more authority than the Scriptures give them. It should always be remembered that the elders are servants of the ecclesia, and are never authorized to lord it over the congregation. Jehovah is the God of peace, and all who have his spirit should seek the peace and well-being of their brethren. The spirit of the Lord will direct those possessing the spirit of the Lord to deal justly with their brethren, to love mercy, and to walk humbly or obediently with God. That will mean that selfishness will be put aside and the best interest of the brethren will be had.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> An ecclesia may delegate to a committee of its elders authority to assign leaders and speakers of meetings. In the exercise of such authority the committee should see to it that the best interests of the ecclesia, which means the interests of the Lord’s kingdom, are conserved. There should be no favorites, nor should any one be pushed aside merely because there is some personal dislike. The determining point should be, Who can serve to the best interests of the ecclesia? And when an unselfish course is thus followed, then all the others of the ecclesia should gladly comply with the arrangement made. If it appears to the ecclesia that the committee has exceeded its authority or acted improperly it is the prerogative of the ecclesia to undo the work of the committee or even to dissolve the committee. The final authority rests with the ecclesia. But whatever action is taken, let it be done with all selfishness absent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> The Lord is now in his temple. He has gathered together those of Zion now on earth and anointed them to do his work. These anointed ones will sec eye to eye; that is to say, they will understand the great fundamental truths and the will of God concerning his people and will act harmoniously. The Scriptures refer to Zion, or the house of God, also under the term Jerusalem. It is written in the Lord’s Word, and which applies at the present time to his anointed; “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.” (Ps. 122:1-3) The feet members of God’s organization must, and now will, stand together, having and manifesting the unity or oneness in Christ, and each one will seek the welfare of God’s organization. This can be done only when there is peace and harmony. Hence the Lord instructs his people: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.”—Ps. 122:6-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Summing up the whole matter then: Jehovah is the God of Peace and makes peace for those who love him. He has created evil, and administers it against those who are wrongdoers. He alone possesses that authority; and he delegates it to whomsoever he will, and none other have authority thus to use such power. Let all of God’s anointed then eschew evil, fear God, deal justly, love mercy, walk uprightly with God, and unselfishly devote themselves to his service. His kingdom is here, and all who have his spirit will thus unitedly sing unto Jehovah the new song.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">PROPHET is a person who professes to proclaim a message from Jehovah God. The Bible reveals the fact that there are both true and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">false prophets. The true prophet is one who always speaks as God’s mouthpiece. His message is the truth, and is designed to be a blessing to his hearers. He is never boastful, and always gives God the credit for the message which he proclaims, and therefore always has the divine approval. A false prophet is a person who claims to be a representative of Jehovah and to speak in his name and to proclaim his message but is in fact the mouthpiece of Satan. A false prophet never has Jehovah’s approval, and his message is always intended to deceive the people and to draw them away from God and a study of his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A false prophet speaks that which is contrary to God’s will; he sneers at, contradicts and denies the message of God’s true prophets. It matters not whether he proclaims his message with deliberate, wilful and malicious intent to deceive, or whether he is the blinded and deluded dupe of Satan and hence unwittingly used of him. In cither case he is a false prophet, and hence the agent of Satan. False prophets are usually afflicted with a large bump of self-esteem. This is manifested in both their written and their spoken words, which always exalt themselves, their theories, their methods, and ridicule and contradict the methods and Word of Jehovah God. On the contrary, God’s prophets are always humble men. They never exalt themselves, yet they speak forth their God-given message with boldness and fearlessness at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God used holy men to write the Bible, and gave them an understanding of what he wished them to write, by giving them special visions and revelations of his will and purpose. This special revelation of his will and purpose is called “inspiration”, and is mentioned by Peter as follows: “The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.” —2 Pet. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These holy prophets were used by God to foretell his purpose and his work, as well as certain events that pertained to God’s people who lived in the days when the prophecies were made, and also to his people who would live in the future. They foretold many things that had fulfilment at the first advent of the Lord, and many other things that are now in process of fulfilment and will be fulfilled in the near future. The many fulfilments of these prophecies at the first advent, which are now facts recorded in history, prove beyond any question that the men who uttered these prophecies were God’s holy prophets and had the divine approval. Yet there are men in our day who dare to sneer at and criticize these prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the Old Testament prophets, Jesus and the apostles were likewise prophets, because they gave to us a message from Jehovah God and foretold many events to occur at the second advent of the Lord. Since the Bible was completed, this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">special </span><span class="font3">“inspiration” from God through visions and revelations has ceased, for the reason that it is no longer necessary. To one who has a proper faith in God and his Word, the Bible is sufficient. He docs not need special revelation to bolster up his faith. Anyone who lacks faith in God’s Word, and needs some special demonstration or evidence that God is true, cannot be pleasing to God. God is testing the faith of his own people now, their faith in his Word and the promises recorded therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many professed people of God lack a proper faith, and are constantly seeking some outward signs or evidences of divine approval and acceptance. The apostle mentions these as follows: “The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">believe not,</span><span class="font3"> lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ . . . should shine unto them.” (2 Cor. 4:4) Jesus rebuked his disciples for their lack of faith, saying: “0 fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ” (Luke 24:25) God is dealing with his people now “according to their faith”; and a person who must depend upon his emotions or upon spiritistic, hypnotic or mesmeric revelations in order to know what the will of God is has no proper or acceptable faith in the revealed Word of God; and so Satan uses spiritism, mesmerism and other occult deceptions to blind his mind to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those agents of Satan who use these methods of deception to blind the minds of the Lord’s people are called false prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible is sufficient and needs no outside support or signs to demonstrate its truthfulness. Paul says: ‘The holy scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.’ ‘All scripture inspired by God is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.’ If this text is true, then any man who denies any portion of the inspired Word is a false prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some parts of the Bible arc not inspired, however. Satan’s words to mother Eve, of course, are not inspired. The words of the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees are not inspired. The words of the three men who accused Job are not inspired, neither are the words of the prophets of Baal, the enemies of Israel, nor of Pilate, Herod, or those men and women who were possessed of demons. The text just quoted says: ‘All scripture </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inspired of God</span><span class="font3"> is profitable.’ It is the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inspired</span><span class="font3"> scriptures that were written by holy men. It is these scriptures that honor and magnify the name of Jehovah God; they harmoniously proclaim his attributes; they contain no contradictions; they correctly state God’s law or rule of action; and every prophetic utterance found in these </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inspired </span><span class="font3">scriptures is sure of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the Bible was completed, and “inspiration” is no longer necessary, a time prophet is one who is faithfully proclaiming what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is written</span><span class="font3"> in the Bible. Such a one is declaring that the Bible is the Word of God, and that it is true and contains no contradictions. He is constantly telling the people of a coming kingdom of righteousness which will bless all the families of earth, both living and dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the Bible was completed, and special “inspiration” is no longer necessary, a false prophet is one who denies that the Bible is the Word of God; denies that it is inspired; denies the virgin birth of Jesus; denies the necessity for the death of Jesus; denies the story of creation, sin, and the fall. These false prophets seize upon some new-found fossil remains, some old bones recently dug up, and try their best to undermine faith in the Bible and to give the lie to the same by proclaiming some wild theory or guess of their own, and then call these guesses by the high-sounding name of “science”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it may be asked, How arc we to know whether one is a true or a false prophet? There are at least three ways by which we can positively decide: (1) If he is a true prophet, his message will come to pass exactly as prophesied. If he is a false prophet, his prophecy will fail to come to pass. This rule is laid down by God himself, through Moses, as follows: “If thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, hut the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously.”—Deut. 18:21,22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) Any prophet whose message tends to turn people against God and his Word or to plant doubts in their hearts, or who denies or contradicts the Word of God, is a false prophet. In Deuteronomy 13: 5 are these words: “That prophet . . . shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) All God’s holy prophets have been, and still are, persecuted for their faithfulness in telling the message God has given them to tell, while the false prophets have never yet been persecuted. The reason for this is obvious. God’s holy prophets foretell the destruction of all false prophets, the destruction of all wickedness and of all wicked people. Of course, this arouses the anger of the false prophets’ father, the Devil; and he instigates all manner of persecution against God’s prophets, and uses his dupes to do the persecuting. God’s prophets never persecute anybody, not even their enemies. All persecution is of Satan.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Judged by these three tests, Moses, Samuel, Job, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and all the minor prophets of the Old Testament, as well as Jesus and the apostles, were true prophets. Every one of these uttered prophecies which have already come true, and others which are to be fulfilled in the near future. Every one of them magnified the name of Jehovah God; every one of them believed in the Bible as the Word of God and honored and reverenced the same, and taught others to do likewise. They stood like adamant against the heathen gods and the doctrines and theories of men; and without exception they were persecuted for giving out their message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conclusion, therefore, is irresistible that they were God’s holy prophets. The difference between a true and a false prophet is that the one is speaking the word of the Lord and the other is speaking his own dreams and guesses. This is most emphatically stated in Jeremiah 23:25-32, which reads: “I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. . . . yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams .... The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. . . . Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, . . . and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true prophet of God </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">today</span><span class="font3"> will be telling forth what the Bible teaches, anti those things that the Bible tells us are soon to come to pass. He will not be sounding forth man-made theories or guesses, either his own or those of others. He will be telling forth the good news of the coming kingdom of Christ, which will bless all the families of the earth. Why will he be telling of this kingdom? The answer is, Because all God’s holy prophets spoke of it, including Jesus and his apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the New Testament, and in our day, the word “prophet” has a thought similar to that of our word “teacher”, in the sense of a public expounder. Hence when the term “false prophet” is used, we shall get the correct thought if we think of a false teacher. The false prophets or teachers of our day are referred to in the New Testament as “antichrists”, for the reason that the word “antichrist” means “against Christ”. Every person who denies the statements of Jesus or of the holy prophets is against Christ, because he is teaching that which is against the truth, against Christ and against Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The false prophets of our day are the financial, political and clerical prognosticators. They assume to foretell future events; but their dreams or guesses never come true, and are always contrary to the teachings of God’s holy prophets. Let us note some examples of false teachings which are contrary to the teachings of Jesus and his apostles and which are put forth by the three classes just mentioned; namely, politicians, clerics and financiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With united voice they declare that the world is getting better and will continue to get better until Christ comes. Now note what God’s holy teachers or prophets say on this subject. These declare that the world will get worse and worse, and that Christ will come for the purpose of converting the world. In 1 John 2:18 we read: “Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.” This text tells us that in “the last time” the world will be filled with antichrists. This being true, of course it will not be converted, as the false teachers claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, in 1 Timothy 4:1,2 we read: “Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared [as] with a hot iron.” Again, in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 is the following statement: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers”; and then follows a long list of other sins which will prevail in the last days. This text proves again that those men who foretell things out of harmony with the Bible statements are false prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1914-1918 these same three classes told the whole world that the great World War would end all wars and make the world safe for democracy; and that the young men who died on the field of battle would die sacrificial deaths as did Jesus and would go to heaven. Their prophecies did not come true. Therefore they are false prophets; and the people should no longer trust them as safe guides, but should look to the Lord through his revealed Word for their instructions as to what is to occur on the earth in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Apostle Peter warns us of these false prophets in the last days, saying: “But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them.” (2 Pet. 2:1) There are many thousands of prominent religious leaders in our day who deny that the blood of Jesus bought the race; they claim that it was not necessary for Jesus to die; they go even further and claim that he did not die, but was really more alive than ever, when he wai} buried in Joseph’s tomb. These are false prophets, because they contradict the Bible and the words of the holy prophets, and thus cast reproach on the Bible and lead people to doubt its truthfulness, and thus turn people away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of God’s true prophets on this subject are as follows: “Without shedding of blood is no remission.” (Heb. 9:22) “Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures.” (1 Cor. 15: 3) “Ye are bought with a price.” (1 Cor. 6:20) “Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”—1 Pet. 1:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several texts tell us that Jesus was dead, and was raised on the third day. (1 Cor. 15:4) The false teachers claim that Jesus was not dead, and hence did not need a resurrection. These false prophets claim that it is the body that will be resurrected. But Paul, one of God’s holy prophets, speaking of the resurrection of the dead, says: “But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come ? Thou fool! . . . that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be . . . ; but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him.”—1 Cor. 15:35-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The false prophets claim that the earth is to be burned up at some future time; but God’s holj<sup>r</sup> prophets emphatically state to the contrary. In Ecclesiastes 1:4 we read: “The earth abideth for ever.” Again, in Isaiah 45:18 we read: ‘ ‘ God himself . . . formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These false prophets tell the people that God has provided a lake of fire and brimstone in which to torture for ever those who do not accept their teachings; others tell the people that many are in purgatory, and that it is possible to pray them out. They teach the people the doctrine of the trinity; namely, that ‘ God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy ghost are three persons in one, and all three equal in substance, in power and in eternity’. They tell the people that they need not study the Bible, ‘because they cannot understand it’; and that if the people will follow the instructions of these false prophets they will not need to study the Bible. Without exception, these things are unseriptural and untrue, and tend to turn the people away from God and from Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These false prophets claim that the governments of earth, even though very wicked and corrupt, constitute God’s kingdom on earth. They claim that all the saved will be in heaven, in face of hundreds of texts which say that the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever. (Isa. 60:21) They discourage Bible study by telling the people that the “Bible is an old fiddle on which one can play any tune”, that it is a book of mystery, and that God did not intend it to be understood. Such remarks turn people away from God and from the Bible, and brand the authors of such statements as being false prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why is it that the words of God’s holy prophets are discredited, denied and sneered at, while the words of these false prophets are given the widest possible publicity, and approved by all great men of earth ? The records of God’s holy prophets, found in the Bible, show that Adam was the first man, and that he lived about 6,056 years ago. Quite recently a man found some bones in Nebraska, and broadcast to the world that they were the bones of a man who had lived in Nebraska over 5,000,000 years ago. His statement was wild, unreasonable and foolish; yet it could be published in the best magazines and newspapers, and retailed from the best pulpits and platforms in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the contrary, if any one should try to defend the accuracy of the Bible and prove that its authors were holy men sent of God, his copy would be refused by the best newspapers and magazines, and he would be denied the use of halls or pulpits to put forth his message. Should some paper be liberal enough to publish his defense, it would be so garbled as to discredit the author and hold him up to ridicule. Why is this true ? The answer is that the false prophets, financial, political and religious, control the pulpit and the press; and that they desire to hold on to their positions of trust, influence and power. They do not want the truth, namely, that they are false prophets, to get out to the people; and so they use their power over the pulpit and press to keep the message from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Anyone who will stand up to defend Jehovah God</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark10"></a>Mir 15</sup>’<sup>1930</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span><span class="font5"> WATCH TOWER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>157</sup></span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">or the Bible today will find himself disapproved, denied the proper publicity of his message, and made the subject of ridicule, ostracism and reproach, while the false prophets can preach the blasphemous doctrine of eternal torment, deny the inspiration of the Bible and the virgin birth of Jesus, deny the fall of man, the atonement work of Jesus, and substitute for these the doctrine of evolution, which is not found in the Bible and which is a contradiction of its teachings. Not only can these false teachings be promulgated, but complete and accurate reports of the same will be found in the columns of all the best papers and magazines. Why is this so? and will it always be thus ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The answer is that Satan is the god of this world, and is the personification of selfishness. He controls men by appealing to their selfishness. It is selfish men who desire to exercise power over their fellow men; who desire positions of ease, comfort, and popularity and to make themselves appear as great ones, worthy of distinction and honor; and who will resort to deception, fraud and oppression in order to gain their ends. It is selfishness that seeks to put forth one’s own ideas and teachings and denies this same privilege to another, and so far as possible hinders another from so doing. These selfish people arc used of Satan to propagate his lies, and this is why they are false prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the New Testament these false prophets are spoken of collectively, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> false prophet; and the information is given that this false prophet is to be utterly destroyed during “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, sometimes called ‘the battle of Armageddon’, which lies just ahead of us. This battle is one waged by Jehovah God against Satan and all his agents, composed of wicked men and wicked institutions of earth. Satan has a wicked, corrupt empire on earth, supported by wicked, selfish men. In the battle against Satan and his empire, Jesus Christ will act as Jehovah’s great general; and so the fight is called a war between the “Lamb” and the “beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Revelation 17:14 we read of this battle as follows : ‘ ‘ These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them.” Again, in Revelation 19:19,20 we read: “I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet. . . . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.” The lake of fire is a symbol of complete destruction, and this statement simply means that the beast and the false prophet will be completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This destruction of the beast (the Devil’s organization) and the false prophet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(all</span><span class="font3"> agencies that have lied to the people and misrepresented God) occurs at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font3"> of Christ’s reign, and is now soon to be accomplished. Satan himself is to be bound for a thousand years, as we are told in Revelation 20:1-3; and at the end of the thousand year's he is to be loosed out of his prison. Verse 10 says: “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are. ’ ’ This means the utter end of Satan. During the thousand years no false prophets are to be permitted to deceive the people; hence they are destroyed at the beginning of Christ’s reign. Thus will end the beast, the false prophet and Satan himself, as well as all those who lie about God and deceive the people. Thank God this deliverance is just at the door! The battle of Armageddon is even now impending. It will be a blessing in disguise; for immediately following it will come showers of blessings to all the people, a full and complete deliverance from sin, evil, and death, from wars, oppression, deception and all other enemies of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WILL EXPRESSED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have just finished reading the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font2"> I think it is the best book that has ever yet been written, because it magnifies the name of Jehovah God in such a manner that we can not help but love him more than ever and devote all our being to the doing of his will, which is clearly expressed in this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am anxious to place this book in the hands of the people as a witness, and also that it may awaken the great multitude, the prisoners, and that the meek of the earth may see Jehovah’s great provision for them and that they also may </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">see </span><span class="font2">the hideousness of Satan’s organization and flee therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I am </span><span class="font2">rejoicing with you in that bold stand which you are taking in your lectures over the radio and in all your writings, especially in your latest book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font2"> This bold stand is strengthening all the “remnant” class at the present time to strike the last blow at Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord continue to give you this boldness, and all who are engaged in this greatest privilege ever bestowed on any of Jehovah’s intelligent creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in the kingdom joys,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INFIDELS TREAT US BETTER’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am late in sending my thanks to you for the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life, </span><span class="font2">which is wonderful; for it seems that each one is better than the last. Surely the Lord is dealing with you in dispensing this meat to us in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It thrills my heart with joy when you get up before your great radio audience and denounce Satan’s organization and the hypocritical bull-frog clergy class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No one knows what the clergy class are any better than the colporteurs, who go forth from door to door and have the door slammed in our faces by the laymen of this devilish system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those outside of Satan’s organization are courteous. We find infidels who treat us better than these so-called Christian people whose god is Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I know you are busy, but I want you to know I love you and remember you in my prayers. “To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron . . . ; this honour have all his saints. ’ ’ May the Lord bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sister by his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINITELY COOPERATING</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year or two the Piqua class has contributed varying amounts to the support of the radio work, but since this branch of the work has increased so wonderfully the friends here desire to pledge a definite sum. At the last regular business meeting it was decided, by unanimous vote, to contribute the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) during the year 1030, by the Lord’s grace. We shall remit quarterly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our canvass we find a number of people who are hearing the chain programs and appreciating them very much. Wo find that station WOWO is heard best in this community. We felt that we wanted to have a share in this phase of the witness work, and we pray that the Lord may bless it to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord continue to strengthen and keep you as you sing forth his praises at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in Christ,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BY LOYAL COOPERATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After careful and prayerful consideration I am writing you this letter, and assure you I am not prompted by any desire to either justify or defend myself, but simply to explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When I resigned as elder in the Los Angeles class I had </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font2">the remotest idea of separating myself from the Society </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font2">tho work thereof. Inconsistent! I agree, but I felt the conditions were such that I had better take a back seat, and, strange as it may seem, I tried to do the impossible; for </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font2">when I started to attend another meeting, which, by the way, had already been formed, I still had in mind to keep in sympathy and action with the service work. I quickly began to see my mistake, and now see more clearly what a terrible mistake it was; and I am eagerly retracing my steps before the gulf should become wider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am sure that I am now fully awake to my condition, and realize that, in the first place, it was due largely to my half-hearted activities in the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I love the Truth, and I love the Lord, and will try to show that by a whole-hearted support of the work and by loyal cooperation with you and all engaged therein, hoping and praying that the Lord will accept and grant me his favor therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">At the election of the Portland (Maine) ecclesia a motion was made and passed unanimously that we all send our lo\c and appreciation of your service for our heavenly Father’s truth; and we all pledge our loyal cooperation to Jehovah and his channel. We decided to obey and cooperate with you in serving Jehovah and in exalting his glorious name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">APPRECIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The writer desires to express his appreciation of the wonderful messages of truth being broadcast each Sunday from tho </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> For several Sundays I have enjoyed hearing Brother Rutherford, and also Brother Franz, whom I know personally. How glad I am to sit in our parlor, tune in the radio, and listen to God’s blessed truth, which the world should heed. It takes courage to speak by air to sucli a great radio audience, denouncing tho present evil order and upholding instead God’s truth and his purpose with reference </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> the redemption of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since 1916 the writer has been reading the truth and attending meetings. Oh, how the world needs the truth and appreciation of God’s way! But tho world speeds on, politics, profiteers and clergy hand in hand with the evil powers, to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May God give you courage to withstand all the powers of the evil one, and lead you safely to the journey’s end. Loving greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Geo.</span><span class="font2"> H. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alford, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Indiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">‘WAITING FOR THE KINGDOM’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Friends:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have received my first copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> and am more than pleased to get them. I have read them all and enjoyed them very much. I wish to thank you for putting me on your subscription list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tho lectures in the latest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> touched me deeply. I am one of the “poor of tho land”. I have gone through tho depths of despair resulting from poverty. My husband is a veteran of the Great Massacre from 1914 to 1918, who helped to lino tho pockets of Big Business, and has of course received the usual reward of nothing. We have five children alive, whom we are trying to rear decently, and who are also Buffering in consequence of our poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There have been quite a number of workless winters. Unemployment is increasing. Instead of being helped to get on their feet, the veterans have been reduced to accept charity. It is a hard life, this struggling for existence. At one time, I am afraid, I was bitter enough to become a Communist; for when one’s children die because of lack of care which a good job with good wages would give them, while others amass fortunes and oppress us, it puts these thoughts into our hearts. But at tho right time I came to some understanding of the Truth. I am not consecrated, just merely truth-hungry. I will try to wait patiently for the kingdom of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here is one who wishes you success. May God bless you in your work. There are thousands of us who are becoming reconciled to our lot, knowing that a day of judgment will bring us our reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">M. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Burton, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manitoba.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark15"></a><a name="bookmark16"></a>SERVICE LEADERS AND REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font3">N MAY of each year the classes of the International Bible Students in the United States have been asked to renew their requests for service leaders for the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is no longer sending out the service leaders, except in a very limited way and at irregular intervals. Regional service directors, however, serve all the classes in the United States that are organized for service, at least once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All being members of one body, anointed to serve the Lord, it is the desire of the Society to keep in touch with all classes. To this end we request that the class secretary bring this matter to the attention of the class, and furnish us with the following information, answering all questions if possible, and send the answers to the Service Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Number each answer to correspond with the number of the question. Write plainly, and give the street address where possible, as telegrams can not be delivered to a post office box.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(a) State the number in your class who are in harmony with the Society and the work it is doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(b) Are weekly meetings held?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(c) At what hours are Sunday meetings held?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(d) Are conditions such that your class can entertain a service leader or regional service director?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(e) Is your class organized for service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(f) If not, would you like the assistance of a regional service director to help you organize?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(g) Give full name and street address of the class secretary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(h) Give name and address of another to whom we could send notice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(i) Give the name of your railway station.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(j) If in the country, state distance from station and if the brother will be met.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(k) What station (or stations) broadcasting watchtower chain (or local) programs can be heard satisfactorily in your vicinity?</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark18"></a><a name="bookmark19"></a>GOOD HOPES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font3">HE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Messiah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God is privileged to participate in this work. Brother Russell always outlined the work during the year in proportion as the Lord provided the money through his consecrated children. We continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appreciates the fact that this blessing came to him as a gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privileges of rising time, energy, and money in telling the message to others. Some who arc doing as much house-to-house witness work as their conditions allow are also blessed with some money which they desire to use in the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls which they cannot personally reach might be fed upon the precious kingdom-gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used in the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much, enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon receipt of this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watch Tower </span><span class="font3">kindly write two cards, exactly alike. One of these</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark21"></a>FOR 1930-1931</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">put aside for your own record of what you have promised; the other send to us. Or, if you prefer, put it in the form of a letter, keeping a copy of the letter for your own convenience. We suggest that it be brief and that nothing else be written except the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace I hope to be able to give to his work for spreading the gospel during the ensuing year the amount of $........................................... &nbsp;&nbsp;I will remit in such amounts</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and at such times as I can find convenient, according as the Lord prospers me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Signature) ______________________________________________________</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">__________</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kindly address this card to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Financial Department, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren residing outside of the United States should write their respective offices in the countries where they reside, and remit their “Good Hopes’’ to such offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of our own selves we can do nothing, but we are assured that the prayers of the righteous avail much. Hence we ask the brethren to present us daily before the throne of heavenly grace, that we may be given wisdom and grace to use the money to the best advantage in spreading the gospel to the Lord’s glory, and to do the work entrusted to us.</span></p>

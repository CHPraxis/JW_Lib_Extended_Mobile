<p><span class="font10">“ Light ” — at Evening Tide</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“It shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.&quot;—Zech. 14: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE <sup>f</sup>day of Jehovah’, &quot;that day,” has been full of surprises for everybody, startling and painful surprises for the Devil and his crowd, and astonishing and happy surprises for the people of God, His remnant in the earth. The latest and happiest of the surprises for the remnant is the exposition of the Revelation to John. As they read it, each of the remnant will see, for himself, just as the work puts it, &quot;that now the issue is completely joined and you have been informed of God’s purposes against Satan’s organization and that you are privileged to have a part therein.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For years it has been perfectly apparent to the thoughtful that prior to Armageddon there must come an exposition of the Revelation that would reveal the Elisha work of the remnant in the earth. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> Book One, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> Book Two, are that exposition and are all that the remnant had hoped for and desired. These books have been inevitable since the first Cedar Point convention, September 1-8, 1919, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font8"> which time the distinction between the Elijah and Elisha phases of the church’s work in the flesh were clearly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The discernment that the very same people, many of them, would be engaged in the Elisha work as in the Elijah work called plainly for additional light on God’s purposes, and the light has come, now on this passage, now on that, ever illuminating the temple of God with clearer visions of His Word and His will, and making it certain that, by the power of God, the salt was being cast into the spring and the waters of truth healed at their source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Salt is good, so the Lord himself tells us, and if the salt is from His own hand, as we believe it to be, and if the results are helpful all round, and bring life and happiness instead of death and disappointment, we can all be glad that in recent years this salt has been thrown into the spring in such generous handfuls. One of the first big chunks of salt that was thrown into the spring was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 27, most of it written by Judge Rutherford while he and his friends were in prison for being Christians in war time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The discernment that Revelation 12 applies wholly this side of 1914 made it certain that the entire book is of similar application, i. e., that it is for the remnant while engaged in doing the witnessing work mentioned in the concluding verse of that chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oddly enough, there are 404 verses in the Revelation of John and the central verse of the book, i. e., Revelation 12:9, reads: “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This verse is not only the mechanical pivot of the Revelation, when viewed verse by verse, but is actually the pivot upon which the new understanding of the book revolves. Nowhere in the Scriptures, prior to this point, is there any intimation that Lucifer’s (Satan’s) access to heaven is denied. It was not God’s will to deny him that access until the full end of the “times of the Gentiles”, and they ended in the fall of 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But it was not until the spring of 1925 that this very important truth was discovered, namely, that Satan no longer has access to the heavenly realm but is devoting his entire energies, and that of his retinue, visible and invisible, to a final onslaught against the remnant of God’s people now here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is perfectly logical that, with the crucial battle of their lives just before them, God would strengthen His people for the part they are to play in that conflict. It would be perfectly illogical to reason otherwise. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> Book One, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> Book Two, are altogether necessary food for the people of God at this time. They cannot do without the food which the Lord has given them in these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The letting in of light on this twelfth chapter of Revelation was the means which God used to let in light on the whole book. Not all at once has the light come, but a little at a time. Many of the great events which have taken place in the church’s history since 1918, and which are plainly marked in the Revelation, could not possibly be understood at the time they happened, nor for long afterward. Obstacles stood in the way which have had to be removed, and they could be removed only one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would have been out of place for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font8"> to appear earlier than it has. Even the Lord himself recognized the principle that His people could learn new truths only about so fast. He said to them on one occasion, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">now.&quot;</span><span class="font8"> Some of these “many things” are in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font8"> Now the church can bear them, and find the bearing of them the easiest of tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Revelation is admitted to be the most difficult hook in the world to understand. For centuries it has rested quietly in the covers of the Bible waiting for the due time to come when its message would be needed. Most certainly it would be clearly understood when needed, but not before. At the right time God has made known to others what would fulfil the purpose He had in mind when the book Revelation was dictated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At this point we quote the exposition of two of the most difficult verses in this difficult book. From our point of view this exposition is perfect, complete, and should be satisfactory to every person that may ever wish to know what the verses mean. The verses in question are Revelation 14:10, 11, which read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation: and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We omit the first two and the last two paragraphs of the exposition of these verses, feeling that there is sufficient in the paragraphs quoted below, from pages 328 to 331, of Book One, to satisfy any reasonable mind. An unreasonable mind will not be satisfied “even though one rose from the dead”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Babylon (Satan and his organization) has compelled the peoples of earth, by a violent rule, to “drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication”, and now those who remain on Satan’s side after being warned must, together with all of Babylon, drink of God’s wine cup of wrath. This does not mean doctrines; because such have refused and continue to refuse to accept the truth and take their stand on the side of the Lord, but are supporting Satan and his organization. Concerning such, Jehovah says: “ I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.” (Isa. 63:6) This “wine of the wrath of God” is “poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation”. This means that his wrath is poured into the container of God and is the potion poured for his enemies, and is not diluted nor adulterated. It is the wrath of God, and is destructive.—Rev. 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those thus compelled to drink of this cup of God’s wrath “shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb”. (Vs. 10) The word here rendered “torment” is from the Greek </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">basanizo</span><span class="font7"> (from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">basis'),</span><span class="font7"> and means “to go to the bottom of things as a test”. Applied to persons, it would mean a close and searching cross-examination. When one was cross-examined under the law and was obstinate and refused to yield, he was confined in prison; and hence the jailer was designated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“basanistes”,</span><span class="font7"> or the tormentor. “And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors [jailors, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diagi],</span><span class="font7"> till he should pay all that was due unto him.” (Matt. 18:34) Clearly, therefore, the torment of Revelation 14:10 must include the confinement in death or destruction which is the fate of the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When dead they could not experience pain; therefore the torment must begin while one is conscious and is undergoing cross-examination before the bar of the great Judge of the temple. Today the kingdom opposers are tormented constantly with the message of God’s kingdom. This is proven by the repeated objection to hearing anything about Satan’s organization and by opposing the witness concerning God’s kingdom. There are those who have been begotten of the holy spirit and enlightened who refuse to say anything about Satan’s organization and who oppose those who are diligently giving the witness for God’s kingdom. The message of the kingdom, and the service thereof, are a torment to them. If they persist in this opposition, the wrath of God, which is the second death, must of necessity be their portion. This torment results from the constant holding of the truth before the rulers of the earth as well as others</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">who oppose, and is done in the presence of Christ and his holy angels, who are witnesses thereto. The faithful remnant are used as witnesses of this torment now in progress. The message of truth annoys the opposers to the kingdom, like the botch or some other loathsome disease. Those who wilfully sin against light and who knowingly treat with contempt the testimony of God’s kingdom and his King, and who oppose the same, and give their support and aid to the Devil’s organization, Jesus says, “shall go away into everlasting punishment. ’ ’■—Matt. 25: 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.” (Vs. 11) Smoke is evidence of a burning fire or flame, because there could be no smoke without fire. (Judg. 20:38-40; Isa. 34:10) The natural tendency of smoke is to disappear. “As the smoke out of the chimney.” (Iios. 13:3) “The heavens shall vanish away like smoke.” (Isa. 51:6) But the fact that the smoke here mentioned does not vanish away, but continues to rise up forever, shows that the smoke-producing fire and brimstone (symbolic of destruction) are never quenched, and therefore the destruction of the wicked never ends; and hence they shall never be permitted to live any more, but “shall be as though they had not been”. This is the fate of the wilfully wicked.— Ezek. 28:19; Ps. 145: 20; 2 Thess. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being tormented while alive by the message of God’s truth, which they willingly resist and oppose, and being jailed in death, they are therefore in the pains or torments of death forever. Jesus was in “the pains of death” but could not be held there: “Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.” (Acts 2: 24) Their only consciousness is before going into death, and then they are conscious of the sorrows and pains such as get hold on the victim before he goes into unconsciousness. (Ps. 116: 3) If the fire were not kept burning, the smoke would cease to ascend; because ‘Where there is no wood, there is no fire’, hence no smoke. (Prov. 26:20) Therefore the continuous smoke arising symbolically says: ‘ This fire of destruction shall never cease, for the wicked shall remain destroyed forever. ’ The scripture does not say that the conscious suffering continues forever, but does say that “smoke of their torment”, which is an evidence of their destruction, never ceases. “For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.” (Isa. 66: 24; 30: 33) The smoke could not represent “the memory” of them, as has been suggested, because “the memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot”, and disappear. (Prov. 10:7) While there is consciousness, there is no rest day or night while the Lord’s witnesses expose them by telling God’s truth. Jehovah therefore ‘vexes them in his sore displeasure’. (Ps. 2: 5) ‘There is no peace for the wicked.’ ’(Isa. 57: 20, 21; 48:22) Therefore the evidence shows that their torment and confinement in jail or death is forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout the entire exposition of Revelation, and the second chapter of Daniel, which latter is included in Book Two, the work is reasonable, consistent, harmonious and convincing. To the remnant it will be inspiring and comforting beyond words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may not be quite so comforting to some. Never in any writings have the hypocritical clergy been given such castigation as is to be found in these books, and Big Business and big politicians come in for their full share of attention, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be a delight to review both of these books at length and to point out a hundred other items of absorbing interest, but no review of these books can do them justice. They must be not only read, but studied, and we earnestly hope that every reader of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> will secure them and study them and do all possible to place them in the hands of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These books will show to all men that God has a people in the earth and just who those people are and what they have been doing in the past few- years and are now doing. They will show all what it means to really worship God, the joys and privileges and blessings of beingin His service. And they show just -what is going to happen to Satan and all who have his spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The books are full of surprises from cover to cover. It is the best of good news that the Devil will really be asleep in death throughout the entire period from Armageddon to the end of Christ’s reign. At the last, he and Judas and all the earlier and later scribes and pharisees and hypocrites will have a good chance to see what they missed by not being faithful to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From one of the concluding passages we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time is indeed short, and there is much to be done. The remnant must be busy. It is a most wonderful and blessed privilege to have some part in giving the witness concerning the vindication of God’s name. Therefore says the prophecy: “Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.” Those who have put forth their best endeavors to be faithful to the Lord and to their covenant have been greatly blessed up to this time. Now they shall be even more blessed by continuing stedfastly, earnestly and diligently to conform their lives and course of action to the prophecy of Revelation now unfolding. Those who have studied Revelation with an honest desire to understand it have received some blessings from the Lord because of the earnest seeking, and now those who learn the meaning thereof and obey what they do learn shall receive even a greater blessing from Jehovah-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is 'one that will personally call on at least 2,500 people during this next year and try to put </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font8"> in their hands, God willing. How many people will you call on for the same purpose? That is the practical part of this surpassingly interesting theme. Make yourself a quota and live up to it. You cam do it if you make God’s work the first and most important thing in life. In a little while now there will be a great crowd that will send up the cry, “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.” Dorit be one of the great crowd. Be of the remnant, who are faithful in fair weather’ or in foul, in peace or in war, in life or in death, in honor or in dishonor, always, everywhere true.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">S THE days go by the anxiety of those who have the responsibility of marketing the wheat of this country increases. The rise of a point or two in the market is hailed with great joy; but often that joy is very short-lived, for the following day a further fall takes place. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hush,</span><span class="font8"> noted for its boldness and plainness of speech, has a very strong opinion upon the workability of the wheat pool. Under the caption, “The Truth about the Wheat Pool,” it says :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What fools the bankers of Canada and the wheat pool bosses have made of themselves. They are the laughingstock of the whole world. These crooked little money lenders are caught more noticeably in this racket than in any of their other selfish experiments with the public’s money in the past . . . with their own illegal personal interests hidden from view!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the vast granaries of Canada today there are one hundred and forty million bushels of wheat that, in the ordinary course of events, ought by now to have been consumed by the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is difficult to imagine the mountain of grain which this figure represents. But, in effect, it means that practically the total amount of last year’s harvest is stored away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus Canada is faced with one of the greatest economic crises in the history of the Dominion because at any moment this glut of wheat may have to be thrown upon the world’s markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ignorant, ill-advised farmers of Western Canada were originally coerced into this folly by the Hon. T. A. Crerar and certain gamblers who entered into a conspiracy with the banking ring. The chief motive was to make a profit by gambling in the wheat market . . . the bankers and their grain-grower associates figured this would be quite easy if they “controlled” the output in a gigantic pool. To ------■ with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">public ... to —-----■ with railroad and shipping com</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">pany earnings . . . that is what they said! They went ahead and formed this ungainly octopus in restraint of trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In effect, they agreed to send their crops to a kind of central marketing board, leaving that board to dispose of the grain at the most favorable prices obtainable. But prices have not been favorable to the grower for a long time now. And so the wheat pool has only sold the indispensable minimum of actual grain, while all the time its granaries and storehouses have been filling up with “surplus” wheat. Now they are going to be beaten as every private -wheat gambler has been beaten in the past, by the visible supply. Wheat is a commodity that can NEVER be really cornered, as any sane business man knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">England can never be damaged by a Canadian wheat pool, and last year the Argentine stepped in and sold her -what Canada was holding back. Further, the economic brains of England would not tolerate such impudent domination by a group of silly Canadian bankers with no more intelligence than the farmers -with whom they are allied in this folly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1928 England paid Canada over £22,000,000 for wheat, while she paid the Argentine just under £14,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last year England only paid Canada just over £14,000,000, while she paid the Argentine about £23,000,0001 This is a suggestive commentary on the economic and public-spirited “vision” of our Canadian “bankers” and needs some explanation from the pro-wheat-pool Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revolt Against Medical Tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More and more people everywhere are getting their eyes open to the medical trust, Editorially the Vancouver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font8"> writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three hundred years ago, priests were selling the public immunity from sin and crime at SO MUCH PER. So commercialized, so corrupt and to so gigantic a scale did this business grow that the public rose up in arms, rebelled and crushed the whole infamous religious machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The principle of selling immunity from sin was vicious; the traffic was monstrous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What was taking place in religion 300 years ago is now taking place in medical practice. Instead of teaching people right living, teaching children and grownups the newer knowledge of nutrition and health mechanics, our “priests of medicine” are out selling, in a wholesale way, “immunity” from every imaginable disease, from colds to cancer, through the black magic of filthy vaccines and serums and unnecessary operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the Medical Association is now to save itself, it has got to clean house; it has got to drop and drop quickly its intolerant Fishbeins and Clamps; it has got to stop its commercial orgy of “immunization” by filthy vaccination; it has got to adopt a sympathetic and friendly attitude to all branches of therapeutic healing; and the medical colleges and doctors, if they are going to progress, and be of real service to the human family, will have to teach people how to get well and stay well via the newer knowledge of nutrition and health mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Like the old church which stood before the bar of an outraged public to answer for its persecution, its tortures and its burning, the medical doctors now stand before the bar of public opinion charged with . their hideous campaign of immunization, unnecessary operations and medical malpractice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today it is an enlightened public the medicals have to deal with; it is a public that know that there is only one road to health, as there is only one road to heaven, and that road calls for a study and practice of Nature’s laws of health; it is a public that knows there is only one immunity from disease, just as there is only one immunity from sin, and that immunity is RIGHT LIVING.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Tyrant’s Road to Ruin</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking further upon the same matter the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is well known that the medical doctors of British Columbia are working hard against the efforts of the drugless healers to secure legislative rights to control, discipline and examine members of their own body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it is not yet known to what despicable lengths the medical doctors are prepared to go to foist their will upon these drugless practitioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been introduced into the legislature a private bill, sponsored by Dr. L. E. Borden, which purports to prevent drugless healers from using the title “doctor”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the face of it, this bill is not important. The average drugless healer is not so interested in parading an academic title as in restoring health to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the insidious part of this private bill, cited as the Medical Act Amendment Act, is in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Any person not registered, pursuant to this Act, . . . who advertises or holds himself out as such (as one who treats human ailments) shall be liable on summary conviction to pay a penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars nor less than twenty-five dollars. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since it is the purpose of the medical doctors to rush this amendment through the legislature without proper discussion, the public should know that these above words simply mean that anyone other than a medical doctor is specifically prohibited from attempting to cure disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In short, if this innocent-looking amendment should pass, it means the finish of every chiropractor, every dietitian and every drugless healer in this province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It means that if a chiropractor even admits that he is capable of treating a lame back, he is guilty of an offense and subject to a hundred-dollar fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the meanest kind of legislative sniping that has ever been practiced by medical men in any part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The drugless practitioners of British Columbia make the eminently reasonable request that they be allowed to control their own body in order that only fully qualified men may practice and that none of these men be permitted to attempt the treatment of illness outside of their own line of specialization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The answer of the medical doctors is this cheap and small attempt to put them out of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will the public stand for this further instance of medical tyranny?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can the legislature, in all fairness to a public seeking health through common-sense methods, sneak through a bill that will permanently squelch a profession that is daily bringing health to the masses, but has the misfortune to be in protest, at present, against the autocratic insolence of the medical doctors?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">People Getting Mors and More Restless .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That the people are getting more and more restless under medical tyranny is well illustrated in the following, taken from the Regina </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An Edmonton woman died because a towel was sewn up in a wound following an operation. The coroner’s jury exonerated the attending doctors. The towel was not one of those intended for internal use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A statistician, so inclined, could weave a poignant human story in figures of such tragedies. He could tell how many cases of this kind occur every year. Tie could list the causes and the inquest findings in each case. He could show that in every case someone was to blame. The towel, or the sponge, or the needle, or whatever the cause of death, did not get there of its own accord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than all these, he could show the growing contempt for the human body among the scalpel fraternity. And he could, by two charted curves, reveal how this contempt has grown with the prevalence of surgical operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each case of death from such causes is a crime. Taken collectively by themselves, they would read like a black chapter of cruelty. Even in comparison to the successful record, they would still be a damning indictment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They would be an indictment of a profession that has indiscriminately associated the scamp and the scientist, and protected both; of a profession which has profited by the penalties of bad living, but has contributed little to the science of right living; of a profession whose salesmen have bullied the public into superstitious terror with fantastic stories of dangers from affected tissues and organs, and equally fantastic claims of knife cures for everything from dandruff to corns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, the statistician would testify how many operations endangering life were first promoted and then performed on one man’s authority and without the advice of colleagues; how many were emergency and necessary; and how much of the whole business was sensible science, and how much butchery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, being a statistician, he would not forget to add that the victims pay for it, often in advance, whether they live or die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Whipping Hungry Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whipping hungry men will certainly not solve the unemployment problem, yet some small minds have been so shortsighted as to try it, according to the following editorial appearing in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spectator,</span><span class="font8"> of Hamilton, under the heading “Parades and Whips”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A demonstration by unemployed, in the city of Vancouver was broken up by mounted police with whips. This does not make pleasant reading for Canadian eyes, even when, as appears from the reports, the demonstrators had deliberately violated police orders and attempted to organize a parade which had been explicitly forbidden. The incident occurred over a protest against the amount of relief wages which were being paid. On the theory that half a loaf is better than no bread at all, these wages, small as they were, might have been accepted as a practical evidence of the municipality’s sympathy. It was at least better than doing nothing at all, though, if the accounts are correct, the sums paid out for relief work were scarcely adequate to provide the bare necessities of existence. Agitators got to work, seeing a splendid chance for promoting their propaganda, and a protest meeting was held. This did not suffer any interference on the part of the police; it was only when, in defiance of orders, the parade was formed that the crowds were dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How to deal with such emergencies is a difficult problem for the authorities. There is, in this instance, no question of suppression of free speech, for the meeting was not disturbed, and the orators were permitted to say what they pleased. But the line was drawn at parades, and action followed only after due warning. Nevertheless, was the use of whips justified under the circumstances? Hungry men, who have shown their willingness to work, are naturally not in the best of humor, and doubtless they gave provocation. Ugly tempers are not to be cured by such methods, however. Discontent is likely to be intensified instead of being appeased. The other day a case was reported from New York, in which a communist, arrested for soliciting alms in the interests of strikers in a certain factory, was released by the magistrate with this parting compliment: “What you need is for me to have you in a two-by-four room. What I wouldn’t do to you! I would blacken your eyes and give you some real American spirit!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not surprising to learn that the reaction of the man to this amiable intention was the declaration that he was ‘more than ever a confirmed communist’. There must be a better way than this of dealing with the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Surveying a Big Country a Big Task</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following interesting article appeared in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mail &amp;&nbsp;Empire</span><span class="font8"> on the blank spaces on the map of Canada:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Know your country or, in particular, see Canada first, is good, patriotic advice, but the average Canadian may be surprised to learn how much of it is still unknown even to surveyors and explorers. At the annual meeting of the Engineering Institute of Canada, Mr. F. H. Peters, surveyor-general, department of the interior, Ottawa, stated that on the best map of Canada available there are vast blank spaces, some of them the size of the province of New Brunswick, of which the future possibilities can scarcely be contemplated. Even today one can take an airplane at the city of Ottawa and fly for an hour and a half and reach a territory of which no reasonably accurate map is available and, consequently, practically nothing definite is known of what exists there. In the entire Dominion, the third largest country in the world, with an area about the size of Europe, only about 525,000 square miles or 14 percent of its area is mapped in anything like an accurate sense. Maps showing considerable detail but inaccurately cover another 13 percent, ■while for 73 percent of the area only the most meager outlines of the coast line and the main inland waterways are presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within the recollection of many living Canadians the great northwest was supposed to be an arid or semi-arid region where wheat growing on a large scale was impossible and it was held that there was no practicable route from east to west through British territory. The unknown regions of Canada today are not as large, but we do not know their resources and we may be equally astray as to their future. Surveying</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">on foot is a slow process, but the airplane has come to the aid of science and aerial surveying has been developed so widely and quickly in Canada that this country leads the world in the application of it. Although only in its infancy, the results have been remarkable. One case cited to the Engineering Institute by Mr. A. M. Narraway, chief aerial surveys engineer of the department of the interior was that of a large water power investigation where there were at least five possible schemes, any one of which might have been adopted. The stereoscopic study of aerial photographs enabled all but one to be discarded without field work and with a great saving in expenditure. For many other purposes the airplane has been of valuable assistance to the surveyor, and it will undoubtedly hasten the disappearance of unknown Canada.</span></p>

Mr. Insull’s protests against the Sackett speech have helped some millions of Americans to see that they are being robbed; but they will soon forget it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T SEEMS incredible that a Labor government could have turned down the channel tunnel in a time of unemployment; but such is the case. Some of the reasons assigned are the considerable cost, the small amount of employment it would give, the damage to existing means of communication, but especially the old argument that it would endanger England, which latter argument, it seems to us, is about the most foolish reasoning possible. Would it endanger England any more than it would France ?</span></p>

For Europe, it is, in actual fact, a great moral defeat that has happened.

<p><span class="font8">Walton County (Florida) Convict Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font8">EELING that the next time the collection box is passed (in order to help the rest of the world up to the high standard we have attained in the United States) the people will give more cheerfully if they know just how high we have ascended in the scale of civilization, we give herewith a portion of a report on the Walton County (Florida) Convict Camp, as published in the Tampa </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Free. Press</span><span class="font8"> of May 17,1930. The investigation of the camp was made by six men, five of them prominent state officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The camp was not properly screened, the beds were dirty, the latrines were unscreened, the well is only about thirty feet from the latrine, prisoners were kicked and knocked about by the captain and the guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Chains are used promiscuously. One convict, who had a rupture but no truss, was wearing leg shackles with an additional nine feet of trace chain tied on to him, which he was obliged to either drag or carry and sleep in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Another BOY had a venereal disease that is virulent, yet he is confined with other prisoners and made to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Prisoners were being hard-timed by the bosses for trivial causes, and brutality is general at this camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A boy -who DIED at the camp last December was kept in ‘the box’ for seventy-six hours and died without regaining consciousness when removed. Information -was given us that the camp cook had drenched this prisoner with water, as a prank, that the captain knew this was done, yet the boy was allowed to stay in the box three days during the cold weather just before Christmas, clad only in a night shirt, and when taken from the ‘box’ was unconscious. Yet the prison doctor said that he died of cardiac insufficiency and he knew that despite the fact that he did not examine the body either before or after death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Dysentery is prevalent at the camp now. In our opinion it is caused by unsanitary conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Another man who had measles was not segregated from the other prisoners. Men were compelled to sleep beside and above him while he had this contagious disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The captain stated to this writer that when a man was sent to his camp he was supposed to be in first-class shape, and that he was expected to get the work out of him. If the man was not in good health, that wasn’t his fault, he was supposed to get it out of them, and did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Prisoners are placed in the ‘box’ for a first offence and confined there for ten days or more, on one small piece of cornbread and water daily, obliged to either sit or stand, because the space is only three feet square.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Prisoners told us that they were cramped and sick when removed, but that they were removed one evening and forced to go back to work the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This is brutality in its lowest form; for who among us could do a decent day’s work after we had been starved for ten days while confined in a space three feet square?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We believe that a prisoner is entitled to humane treatment, even though he has been convicted of a law violation, and we do not expect them to be treated as free people, but we are indeed sorry for those poor devils who must live under the brutality and ignorance of such authority. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.We might add that this report speaks volumes for the medical profession and their demand (not request) that the entire care of the health of the American people should be turned over to the American Medical Association. No doubt this prison physician was and is in good and regular standing in the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bedbugs and Smallpox</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. Charles A. R. Campbell, of San Antonio, Texas, is the author of a book entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bats, Mosquitoes and Dollars,</span><span class="font8"> in which is presented the evidence that the bedbug is the carrier of smallpox and that when a nation has been de-bedbugged its smallpox is automatically obliterated. Dr. P. L. Clark, broadcasting over station WEDC, Chicago, declares that the evidence in this book is so complete as to furnish indisputable proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If this proposition is a fact, as seems to us likely to be the case, it certainly puts the serum squirters in an awful hole. Here they have been poisoning people and killing and maiming them for life when all that was necessary was to paint the beds liberally with a mixture of shellac, sulphur and corrosive sublimate and put fresh sheets and pillow cases on them, and occasionally air the blankets and mattresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Vaccination is as effective as the totem pole, and belongs to the same era of intelligence. Just now they are putting up totem poles in the parks, so that people can see what the natives were so foolish as to believe only a little while ago. Wait a little and see the monuments they erect to show the intelligence of our vaccination era. The generation to come will hardly be able to hold their sides, and they will not have any marks on their arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his radio lecture, Dr. Clark mentioned that Dr. Campbell had charge of the pesthouse at San Antonio, and purposely selected as his attendants persons who were unvaccinated and who had never had smallpox. These attendants saw to it that all who came in were carefully undressed and de-bedbugged. Dr. Clark said further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So well is Dr.Campbell’s work understood in San Antonio that the county commissioners, one of whom was never vaccinated, came to the pesthouse, without fear of getting smallpox, and had dinner with him, and they were waited upon by those who were in attendance on smallpox eases. No one ever got smallpox, because Dr. Campbell saw to it that they were not bitten by bedbugs, which had previously had the opportunity of sucking a little blood out of a smallpox patient. A few other doctors took up Dr. Campbell’s work, crossed into Mexico, and proved time and again that it was bedbugs that caused the transmission of the disease and that when smallpox was isolated and there were no bedbugs no one else caught the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Campbell relates in his book that a family camo to the pesthouse (the father and mother having previously had smallpox) and three of the children were down with smallpox, but the fourth little girl did not have it. They wanted to all stay together, so Dr. Campbell housed them in a large room and turned them loose together, after de-bedbugging the family. All during the time the three sisters had the smallpox the little sister played around the room with them, never took the smallpox and she was with them all the time during the period of desquamation, or peeling off of the skin, and yet she was discharged from the pcsthouse without ever having had the smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About a -week later Dr. Campbell was called to the house to see the little girl and found her with a fever and smallpox developing. He immediately examined the house and found it alive with bedbugs. This little girl had been bitten by bedbugs which had bitten her sisters just over the smallpox, and they had inoculated her with smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Campbell was called to a hotel one day and found a girl vrith a case of smallpox in a room. He moved her over to the pesthouSe, locked the door, and told the landlord not to open it until he gave him permission; and as soon as he had time to go back he carefully examined the room for bedbugs, found the beds clean, and no bedbugs or traces of them in the ■walls, and he opened the door and told the landlord he could use the room, and the room was immediately put in use, without any fumigation, without anything done except the ordinary cleaning, and clean linen, as carried out in any hotel, and still they never had any smallpox from anyone staying in that room. I think Dr. Campbell is a very great man and a great benefactor to humanity in proving the bedbug as the carrier or transmitter of smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Trees: Interesting Facts About Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font8">OW little the average person knows about one of the most common things in the world, a tree!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Did you ever stop to think what you would do without trees </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is more than likely that you were born in a house built largely of wood. You were laid in a cradle, bassinet or crib (according to the era in which you first saw the light) made of wood. You rode about.in a carriage or gocart of wood. You sat in a high-chair at a table, both of which were products of trees. You ate fruit from trees. You played in the shade of trees, and on reaching school age you entered a building-made at least partly of wood, to sit at a desk of wood, in a chair of wood, and learned to write with a pencil of wood. You gazed at pictures framed in wood, used rulers of wood, and occasionally felt a rap from a rattan of wood when off your good behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your teacher designated various objects with a pointer of wood. You clattered over floors of wood, down steps of wood, to play beneath trees, and hung over a fence of wood until the bell rang, and you returned to write on paper-made of wood, or, perhaps, if you were good, the teacher asked you to erase writing from a blackboard made of wood with erasers made partly of wood. Then you ran home across a bridge of rvoocl to play with your cart of wood, or your mother sent you to gather w<sup>7</sup>ood for kindling, and then she cooked your supper from the heat of the burning wood. At last, tired and sleepy, you tumbled into your bed also made of wood, to dream of tops and other toys of wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But enough—by this time you begin to realize what wonderful things trees really are and that one could scarcely live at all without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They give us shade and beauty for our eyes. They furnish delicious fragrance for our nostrils. Our ears are thrilled with the sweet sounds of birds and breezes in their boughs. How delectable are their fruits and nuts to our palate! and we gather the buds in the spring, the flowers in the summer, and the leaves and fruits in the autumn. Even in winter their sturdy trunks cheer us with thoughts of the coming spring, and ofttimes the snow<sup>7</sup> upon their boughs delights our hearts with resplendent beauty. Every sense is pleased and satisfied with the trees, which an allwvise, all-loving Creator has given man for his use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Gertrude P. Means (Massachusetts}</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just how many beautiful poems and erudite bits of prose have been written about trees will never be knowm. The poet Joyce Kilmer tells us,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I think I never yet did see A poem lovely as a tree. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How unobservant the eye that never stops to gaze upon a beautiful tree standing alone in a field. What symmetry! What grace and sweep of branch and color of leaf! an oak, an elm, a maple, it may be, each discernible by its own particular shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. A feeling of delight pervades one’s being vdien passing through a shaded avenue of glorious oaks or elms; while a forest brings awed rapture to the heart of even a child, if he be thoughtful, as he beholds the great trees whose tops mingle and point to the sky, obscuring the light and making the place beneath dark as night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the very beginning, man w<sup>7</sup>as placed in the beautiful garden of Eden, wherein grew<sup>7</sup> “every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food”. Since that time mankind has admired and used the trees all down through the centuries, but now some scientists who claim to know say that in a very few<sup>7</sup> years there will be no more trees, and that recourse must be had to substitutes; and, in fact, today many articles which -were formerly made of wood are now<sup>7</sup> being replaced w<sup>7</sup>ith those of a different material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But we do not as yet see any lack of w<sup>r</sup>ood for building purposes, unless the use of concrete be an exception. In the case of furniture, while there may have been some use of metal for bedsteads, it seems to have been only a passingstyle, and now<sup>7</sup> the wnoden article is finding a ready sale in the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other scientists do not agree w<sup>7</sup>ith the first mentioned, but declare that their statements are untrue. I quote from “The Story of Wood”, gotten out by the National Lumber Manufacturers Association, of Washington, D. C.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to a widespread misunderstanding in the mind of the public regarding conservation, the idea has gone abroad that the use of substitutes is necessary in order to preserve the forests. This is not true. There is a right wood for every need; there is plenty of wood both for new uses and for old. Of timber fit for-sawing into lumber v.<sup>7</sup>e still have nearly half as much as when the first Pilgrim axeman chopped his first tree in New England—notwithstanding the hundreds of millions of acres of timberland that have been permanently cleared to make room for farms, roads, and the homes of more than a hundred million people. The United States Forest Service tells us that almost a quarter of the entire land area of the country is still forest land. There is actually more land for growing trees than there is for crops and farm pastures. With care of our forest land we shall probably have more forest products a hundred years hence than now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We still have about 135,000,000 acres of virgin forests. That means that if they were gathered together they would make a solid forest belt 70 miles wide extending from New York to San Francisco. Then there are about 255,000,000 acres of cut-over forest land that are growing new trees in some degree, and about 80,000,000 acres that are practically unproductive. Put all the forest land into one belt 225 miles wide— the distance from New York to Washington—and again it would reach from New York to San Francisco. The area of these timbered regions is more than three times that of all France—equal to nine Minne-sotas, sixteen Pennsylvanias, or seven Oregons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If any one should know about the forests, certainly the United States Forest Service should, and its statements seem to be beyond dispute. Ex-President Coolidge said not long ago, “The use of substitutes hardly keeps pace with the new uses for wood. There is no likelihood that we could become a woodless nation if we wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The uses of wood are so numerous and so necessary that it has been called “the indispensable material of civilization”'. If one stops to think what civilization would be like without trees, without wood in any form or product, it will be seen that this is not an exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a most fortunate thing in the use of w<sup>T</sup>ood that it is so great a natural reproducing resource and potentially inexhaustible. Minerals may become exhausted. If a mine is dug out there is a gaping hole left. Cut a tree, and a new one, or may be several, will grow in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Trees are giant perennial plants which “grow from the ground with a single permanent selfsupporting trunk or stem, 'which may be from 25 to 30 or more feet in height”. The roots support the tree in the ground, drawing from the latter mineralized water which ascends through the trunk to the leaves, where it unites with the carbon which they take from the air. The sap thus formed is the food of the tree. It descends in the outer layer of the living or sap wood while the water from the roots is ascending through the inner layers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In descending, the sap deposits a sticky secretion between the sap wood and bark, which immediately develops into cells, making either true wood or bark, and thus forming a layer called the cambium. In this way ordinary or exogenous trees form annual rings of growth, which may be counted when a cross cut is taken, thus telling the age of the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In endogenous trees like the palm, the new woody tissue is interspersed with the old tissue throughout the trunk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The food of trees, except for the small amount of mineral matter taken in water through the roots, is obtained almost entirely from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As this mineral matter nearly all returns to the ground in the falling leaves, it may be seen that trees do not appreciably exhaust the soil. The fact is, the leaves make the upper layer of rotting organic matter, humus, which is an </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font8">portant element in fertilizer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Trees shed their leaves in the autumn to keep from dying of thirst through the winter,” says Martin L. Davey, the tree expert. He continues : “On the average tree there are several acres of leaves—literally millions of them. Every leaf gives off water. But. during the winter the tree’s roots absorb very little moisture. Consequently, if the leaves remained on the tree and continued to tap the water supply, the tree would soon die. So nature sentences the leaves to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The process used by nature to make the leaves fall is complicated. Weeks before the first frost she begins to extract from the leaves all the food substance which the leaves manufacture and which the tree needs, and gradually the leaves wither. Simultaneously, a thin-walled layer of cells is formed at the base of the leaf where it is attached to the twig. This layer is a zone of weakness, so that eventually the leaf falls of its own weight or is blown off by the wind. The scar left by the falling of the leaf is well protected by nature. It immediately becomes covered with a substance which is practically waterproof. Since the bark of the tree also is almost impervious to water, the entire tree is practically ‘bottled up’ for the winter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nearly all trees are of slow growth, taking from ten to forty years to attain post-size and fifty to two hundred or more to arrive at' saw-timbei’ maturity. Some trees may thus grow for hundreds and even thousands of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the Sequoias of California have survived from preglacial, geologic times. Ring counts prove some of them to be over 4,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">years old. These Sequoias, or Big Trees, and the Redwoods are among the giants of the tree world, sometimes reaching a height of between 300 and 400 feet and a diameter up to 35 feet. The bark is often as much as two or three feet thick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The width of the growth rings shows the climate during the forming period. Burn scars indicate forest fires in the past. From these large trees meteorologists infer that the rainfall w<sup>T</sup>as much heavier in the 14th and 15th centuries than it is now and that there were great fires in the years 245, 1441, 1580 and 1797. The record may be consulted still farther back, as there are Sequoias still standing which were 2,000 years old when Jesus was upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">National Geographic</span><span class="font8"> for December, 1929, carries a very interesting article on those so-called “Talkative Tree-Rings”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two series of the National Geographic Society expeditions, one of which explored the famous Pueblo Bonito ruins in New Mexico, and the other which sought to ascertain the age of these ruins, have made findings of great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They show that the southwestern United States was populated nearly eight centuries before Columbus crossed the Atlantic. They discovered the ages not only of Pueblo Bonito, but also of some forty other ruins whose date of occupancy was hitherto unknown. “Moreover,” the editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Geographic</span><span class="font8"> informs us, “they have developed a tree-ring calendar which can be applied to all early ruins in which datable timbers exist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have collected an unbroken series of tree-rings, and thus made clear the chronology of the Southwest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This tree-ring calendar goes back to 700 A. D. and provides a continuous weather chart for 1,200 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We quote the leader of the Tree-Ring Expedition, Andrew Ellicott Douglass, So. D.: “Through long-past ages, with unbroken regularity, trees have jotted down a record at the close of each fading year—a memorandum as to how they passed the time; whether enriched by added rainfall or injured by lightning and fire. By learning how to read these records—especially those of the pines-—we have discovered a magic key to open mysterious books and interpret the meaning of their writings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The members of the expedition found in examining trees of the same age that the rings are identical. Thus a series was formed by taking trees of a greater age and dovetailing the rings, bearing in mind the fact that a succession of dry years makes a corresponding succession of thin rings, and that of wet years makes wide rings, they found that by placing one series below another and matching corresponding rings they could trace back many centuries. When the limit of living trees was reached the beams from ancient ruins 'were used and finally buried logs carried the story back for many more centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This method of dovetailing tree rings to find a hidden date reminds the student of the Bible of the method Jehovah used to indicate the length of certain periods. First the age of Adam is given when a son, Seth, was born. Then the age of Seth is given at the time his son Enos was born, and so on dowm to Noah, thus establishing the date of the flood as 1,656 years from the creation of Adam. Other periods of time are to be formed in like manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus we see in each of these methods that “God is his own interpreter and he will make it plain” to the earnest students of His Word and works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scientific men, however, seldom consult God’s Word either for instruction or to corroborate their findings. If they did, they would see that their wild guesses of millions of years as having elapsed since the beginning of the creation of the earth are foolish in the extreme. They would discover that each of the creative days is 7,COO years in duration, and that we are now living approximately in the 48,000th year since Adam, and are now in the dawn of the &quot;golden age of prophecy’ foretold by the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Returning to the subject of trees, we find that the forests of America have the greatest variety of useful species of wood in the world, there being more than one hundred of them in commercial use; some thirty of them in large numbers. Included in these are soft and hard woods— w<sup>r</sup>oods for necessity and woods for luxury; also trees producing food, such as maple sugar, fruits and nuts; also rubber, turpentine, rosin, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These forests are growing all the time, and today 30 percent of all forest woods come from land from which trees have been cut several times during the past three hundred years. Still, while we have an ample supply for present needs, there is need for conservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This means the harvesting and use of ripe trees while still maintaining the forests as a whole. Such conservation is a business, just as much as farming. In fact, it is a sort of longterm farming that deals with colossal plants instead of small ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If left alone, nature reaches a balance of death and decay; but man steps in and substitutes use for decay and waste. So wood is a crop that needs to be cut when ripe. Failure to do this would mean loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the United States the government has a hundred million acres of forest land which the Forest Service administers on the principle named above. Congress created these great public forests as sources of a “perpetual supply of timber for the people of the United States”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At present, forests cover about 30 percent of the land area of the United States, and about 25 percent of Canada; although in both countries the original stand of timber has been greatly depleted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The British Empire owns about 1,571,000,000 acres of forest land; Russia, nearly 1,582,000,-000; Brazil, 1,000,000,000; United States and possessions being fourth, with 685,000,000; France and its colonies, 295,000,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Forests react on climate. Humidity and summer coolness of the air are greater in forest regions than in open countries. Rainfall does not evaporate or drain oil so rapidly, and the force of windstorms is broken. Forest land does not suffer so much from a dry spell as open land, and floods are not so likely to occur where the banks of the rivers are covered with trees, because such land gives up its water very slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Forests also afford protection for and thus conserve wild life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Food and clothing, shelter and warmth, have been provided for man by the forests all down through the ages. From them he has procured the intimate articles of his life and the means of travel by land and water, thus trees are woven into the life and history of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chief enemy of trees and forests is the demon fire. Often lightning has caused fires which have burned for countless eons. Pines and other coniferous trees have no doubt been burning and growing ever since their appearance on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The coming of man increases the fire hazard. Often savages fire forests in order to promote success in hunting and to improve the berry crop. Much of the prairie country, and probably some of the plains of the United States and Canada, were created in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Usually new forests succeed old ones, but if the fires recur too often the young growth, seeds and fertile topsoil itself are destroyed. Thus ages of grass, brush and straggling growth must come before solid forest appears again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a fire it commonly happens that the dominant tree in the new forests is of a different species. A pine forest will succeed an oak, or an oak will succeed pine. That is the unfortunate effect of fires: the new trees may be of inferior species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people are very careless with fire; hunters, campers, trappers, explorers and others often leave camp fires smouldering or throw down matches without fully extinguishing, the flame. Sparks from locomotives also start fires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the wind favors a fire it often becomes an on-rushing monster of destruction and devastation. Often whole communities have been wiped out of existence, with great loss of life and property. It is probable that within the last 125 years more timber in the United States has been destroyed by fire than has been used in the industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the most part reforestation is of no value unless there is a reasonable assurance that its results will not be wiped out by fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the United States $4,000,000 is expended annually for the protection of privately owned forests, of which state appropriations or special taxes make up nearly half and lumbermen the remainder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The federal government also expends $2,500-000 a year on protection, but all but $400,000 of this is spent in the national forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Federal Reforestation Law recently enacted, when fully operative, will, it is hoped, be productive of adequate funds for forest fire fighting and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not fire, but the owner of the hand that lights the fire, is the enemy of the public; so the fire problem is not a fire-hunt but a man-hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Great damage is also done to trees and forest products by insect pests, worms and fungi. Notable among these, is the spruce bud worm, which has devastated whole forests in Maine and Quebec; and the western pine beetle has destroyed half a billion board feet of standing timber in the Pacific coast and Rocky mountain forests. In addition, gangrenous canker, rotting roots and heart rot rapidly reduce timber production and impair the quality of the living tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chestnut blight and the white pine blister have done great damage to forests; and in the case of the blight, the chestnut tree has been practically exterminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Logging operations and manufacturing of wooden products both entail much waste of material, but science is ever finding new uses for wood, and the tendency is toward utilization of all parts, even including bark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the whole, the watchword is for more conservation and economy in the use of forests and forest products and more protection against fire, pests and decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The original forest area of the United States “is estimated at 822,000,000 acres, or about two-fifths of the whole land area, but now commercially it is commonly put at about 470,000,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These forests are divided into three broad belts. One extends from the Atlantic to just west of the Mississippi; the second extends from the Pacific across the Sierra and Cascade mountains; while the third lies along the Rocky mountain system from Canada to Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Eastern forest is or was predominately hardwood in about half its extent, and these are scattered among the conifers in the northern and southern parts. The Eastern forest region is commonly separated into Northeastern, Central and Southern forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The virgin Northeastern forest was largely white pine, red spruce and hemlock and other conifers, with some beech, birch and hard maple. Much of this land, however, is in second growth timber and is not nearly so valuable as formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Central forest region is mainly of hardwood. But very little virgin timber is found in it, as the land has been permanently cleared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The magnificent Southern forest is mainly yellow’ pine. Cypress is found, also oak, hickory, ash, elm, sycamore, maple and red gum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. The Rocky mountain forest contains western <sup>f</sup> pine, white pine and other coniferous trees, as well as hardwoods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">( . The Pacific coast forests have the largest trees and the heaviest stands in America, if not in the world. These are chiefly of redwood, Douglas fir, true fir, western hemlock, Sitka spruce, red cedar and Port Orford cedar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The majestic beauty and towering mass of the great redwoods and firs are beyond description. Few of man’s boasted edifices exceed them in height, and no other tree, unless it be the Australian gum tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font8"> few thousand square miles of such trees at their largest and densest continually renewed might well supply the world with wood forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;From one redwood tree have come 400,000. board feet of lumber—enough to build 40 cottages; and from one acre 1,430,000 feet—sufficient to erect a ten-story building covering the space of an acre.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our American Forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;These -wonderful trees! Who would ever dream that earth could bear such growths? Lonely, silent, serene, -with a physiognomy almost god-like and so old that as far as man is concerned they are the same yesterday, today and forever, emblems of permanence.”—John Muir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nothing so conveys the concept of the awful mysterious powers of the primeval natural world as the depths of these forests. If these great trees could speak they would tell a thrilling story of -wood, a story touching the dawn of man that sketches the epic romance of America from the subjection of the savage wilderness to the populating, upbuilding and enrichment of this blessed land of ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">East of the Cascade mountains grow western pine, Douglas fir and -white pine. The Sierra Nevada range has thick forests of California white pine, sugar pine, incense cedar and red fir. Here grow the stupendous “Big Trees”, or Sequoias, which are no longer cut but are jealously guarded as rare and ancient natural monuments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although the Pacific coast forests are much less in area than the other two main forest regions, they have such dense timber stands that the three states of Oregon, Washington and California hold more than one-half the volume of standing commercial saw-timber in the United States, the total being about two and a half trillion feet, as against the original stand estimated at five trillion two hundred billion feet. Constantly, however, the forest lands are being encroached upon by agriculture. On this account the federal government has taken over 157,000,000 acres and set them aside as national forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These must not be confused with national parks and monuments, which are set aside for maintenance in a state of nature for recreational, scientific and aesthetic purposes. The national forests are reserved for the growing of trees and production of forest products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is generally agreed that the United States has a sufficient area of forest land to yield the present production of forest products indefinitely if it were properly cared for and protected. This conservation is of the greatest importance. The standing forests must be prudently administered and rigidly protected, if not there will be a period of uncomfortable scarcity.” (From </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our American Forests,</span><span class="font8"> by the National Lumber Manufacturers Association.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It does not matter who holds the title to the forests, they are in a very real sense commonwealth. They not only cover, protect and beautify the land in many ways, but also maintain the flow of springs, wells, brooks and rivers; and not only shelter wild life and afford recreation, but give shelter, occupation, tools and wealth to vast numbers of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most Americans prefer timber-built houses, and probably 70 percent live in them, and the rest in those built partly of wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Our railways would scarcely be possible without the forests which supply them with more than a hundred million cross-ties a year and give them the material for the majority of their freight cars. Telephone and telegraph companies would have a sorry time of it without poles. Coal and other mines could scarcely be operated without mine posts. Farmers would be greatly annoyed if there were no wood for fence-posts and fortheir agricultural machinery or for fuel. Public information and education would be sadly crippled if the newspapers and books had no forests to yield their paper. Without turpentine our towns would be paintless. Without timbers most streams would be bridgeless. Deprived of their lumber a hundred varieties of wood-working and wood-using industries, having thousands of establishments and employing hundreds of thousands of men, would shut down. With wood eliminated from the tools, furniture, instruments, machinery, and articles of daily life, men wmuld scarcely know how to live.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our American Forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lumber is measured and sold by the board foot. A board foot is a square foot of lumber assumed to be one inch thick. Thus a board twelve feet long, twelve inches wide and one inch thick would contain twelve board feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lumber is classified according to species, use, size, form of manufacture, and quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Heretofore there has been much confusion in the classification, both as to size and quality, because each regional group of manufacturers has had its own size and grade rules. Within the past few years the National Lumber Manufacturers Association and other associations in cooperation with the United States Forest Service have established and procured the adoption of ‘American Standards’ of lumber sizes and grades of soft wood. In the same way national standards for hard woods are now nearly completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If lumber is bought from manufacturers or dealers operating under “American Lumber Standards”, the buyer need have no concern about his receiving his desired selection of size and grade if he will but plainly specify that he wishes them to be in accordance with “American Lumber Standards”, approved by the United States department of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of the facts herein presented there can be no doubt in the minds of those who are watching and using God’s Word as their guide, that the kingdom of God is near, even at the door—that glorious time when “they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands”, and “they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall hurt nor make afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it”. “Praise ye Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rights of Conscience Inalienable</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE United States circuit court of appeals, reversing the decision of the lower courts, has admitted Dr. Macintosh, of Yale University, to citizenship despite his conscientious objections to war and has stated that “the rights of conscience are inalienable rights which the citizen need not surrender and which the society or government can not take away”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Witnessing in the Transvaal </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Bartels \Colp.\</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'(A letter to a friend)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Y</span><span class="font8">OU are wondering how many books I placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, you will be surprised if I tell you that I have worked in this place for three days and delivered only ten books. This place is hopeless! The people are so narrow-minded, they won’t have anything to do with books outside their church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This morning, after working for three solid hours without leaving one book, I just felt like going home and giving up the whole business, when someone said to me, It is no use going to the next house, because they are English. So I thought, Well, I would like to meet with English people, for a change. I went and knocked. A woman came out, put both her hands on my chest and nearly pushed me off the stoop, and said, “Go!” You can imagine my surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I stood there for quite a few minutes not knowing what to do next; but I plucked up courage again and went on, because I wanted to finish the street before lunch time, when at just the next house I came across Brother and Sister Eberson. I did not know there were Bible Students here. It was so nice to meet with smiling faces and kindness, after all the rebuffs of the morning, that I just burst out in tears and had a good old cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then I felt better; and when I got home, or to my room, I found your letter. It was very sweet of you to write, and it came just when I needed it most. Sister A. is doing better; she works the business places, and the men are not so nasty as the women. She places quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now I must tell you a few experiences we had in other places. When I got to Beaufort West, Sister A. had already worked there for two days and it had already come to the ministers’ ears, so we decided to just go on and make the best of it. As it was the end of the month I just took orders and placed quite a few books, not knowing that the minister was following me up all the time. Where he could not go, he sent others to warn against our books; and then Sunday came and that was the finish of us, as he also warned the people from the pulpit. But still we went on, although it was a hard fight. I took about 70 orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the end of the month came I started to deliver, and walked for two days; and can you guess how many I got out of the 70 orders? Only one! and as far as I went the people came running out of the houses with the books they had, wanting me to take them back. But, of course, I refused to take them back; so I suppose they burned them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next we went to Murraysburg. The reception w<sup>T</sup>e got there was far worse than at Beaufort West. It was really the limit. We got there late in the afternoon, tried all the boarding houses, but could not get a room. It looked rather suspicious, but we could not dream of what was going to happen the next day. At last a man took jis in. His wife was on holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, when morning came we started off with’ high hopes that we were going to do quite a good bit before the minister came to hear about us, little knowing that he had everything ready for us. The first place Sister A. went was the post office. The minister saw her going in (his house is quite near); so he immediately called up the postmaster and told him to tell her to come to his house and see him, but she told him that she was very busy, that if he wanted to see her she would be home after 7 o’clock in the evening, and then he could come and see her there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the game started. He sent out a colored boy with a bell and big board with the inscription, “There are two women going about town with very dangerous books. Don’t buy; and those that have bought already, please burn them.” I saw the boy with the bell. He was always just ahead of me, but I took no notice of him; I thought perhaps it was an announcement of something on that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Sister A. and I met at lunch time she told me that the minister phoned all the business places to warn them; and it was only then that I heard what the bell and board meant. But we did not give in. We started off again in the afternoon; then something else happened. The teachers sent the school boys after us. They followed us up wherever we went, calling us names like ‘Russellites’, ‘Castor oil,’ and I don’t know what not; it was too funny for words. We had a good old laugh over it that night, and the next morning I went to the minister and told him what I thought of him and the teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Illegalities in Law Enforcement</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N THE questionnaire or application for citizenship which must be filled out by those born in foreign lands who would become citizens of the United States there is now a question, “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This question was not inserted until the year 1924, after this government had stood for 148 years. That it was put in at the behest of the militarists goes without saying. In effect it says that Jesus Christ would be debarred citizenship from this country if He were to seek it, and the courts have so construed it in the case of some who believe in Him and are trying to follow His precepts. The insertion of this question was mischievous and illegal, because not required by law and thus invading a latent right never as yet surrendered by the people who own this government and for whom the government works. Employers do- not relish being ordered about by employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A similar case of officiousness and illegality in civic administration is noted in New York city where, so it is claimed, an airplane loaded down with deadly gases daily hovers over the city, ready to drop its load whenever and wherever the people who send it up in the air dictate. The people were never consulted about this thing, not in the least, and the people do not like it. It is another case of the servant girl getting ready to throw the mistress out of the house. Big Business likes this Mussolini idea through and through, but there are several times ten million Americans who do not like it, and they have yet to be heard from, and doubtless will be, in due time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Mace, Ohio. “I am done with the churches and the preachers; and I would like to know how to get back into Christ’s glad service. I used to preach as a Methodist, but am through. Please tell me the conditions of selling your books and how to get them. I have read them all, but would like for all others to read them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Baltimore, Md. “We wish to express our appreciation of your watchtower programs on Sunday mornings, and hope you will continue them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Malden, Mass. “I have listened to you for the first time today, over the radio, and your lecture has opened my eyes to many things which I did not sec before. I hope that you will continue these lectures and I shall be hearing you each Sunday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Webster Groves, Mo. “I am writing this letter for the family. Four of us listen in each Sunday to the watchtower chain program. My husband has no faith in the preachers nor in their churches. All work is suspended in our home while the watchtoweb lecture is on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bronx, N. Y. “It seems as though a sabbath day would be incomplete if I did not listen in to Judge Rutherford’s lecture in the morning. Your lectures have been a great help and inspiration ; and, by all means, I pray you may continue to give the light to those who walk in darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Guthrie, Ky. “AVe enjoy the lectures from Judge Rutherford more than anything else that we can get over the radio. My husband will not go to any church, as it bores him to sit through the sermons, but he eagerly listens to the voice of the judge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Acton, Ind. “Keep up the good work. Here in my neighborhood we all gather’ in the home of one of the neighbors. I say all, about six. We enjoy the message of truth. I say we do, so much , so that we stay here and hunt Bible scriptures until twelve o’clock. Some time ago I was in the ‘churches’, so called, but I have pulled out and feel good about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cherokee, Kans. “I am one of your many radio listeners, and will say I want the lectures continued if possible, as it is the only Sunday school or church in which I take part.”</span></p>

We know that the Lord is with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Acton, Ind. “AVe enjoy the programs and want them continued. They sure are meat in season, and highly seasoned for Satan and his organization. Thanks to Jehovah, we will not have to endure Satan’s reign very much longer. Conditions are bad in Indiana.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Baltimore, Md. “Your lectures are wonderful, especially on the ‘League of Nations’ and ‘Prohibition’. May you continue to tell the truth concerning God, for we are just waking up to the fact that we have not been taught the truth all these eighty years. I say, please continue to explain to us His works and words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Marion, Ind. “We wish to express our appreciation for the watchtower programs. We listen in every Sunday morning and enjoy every word, and we hope that they will be continued, as they are the best on the air.”</span></p>

In addition to purchasing the full set of books containing Jehovah’s message to the people, he handed me $5.00 with the following statement: ‘I hear Judge Rutherford over the radio. I believe this message is for the people’s good. Please take this $5.00 to help pay the expenses.’ Since then we had a meeting of those who had purchased the books in the neighborhood. Last night 19 were in attendance. Jehovah is surely with us; nothing will stop the message now<sup>T</sup> until completed. Indeed it seems now that everyone has heard Judge Rutherford give the kingdom message over the air. Many people who once refused to even hear our story are now anxious to hear it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Philadelphia, Pa. “I listen in every Sunday morning to the watchtower service on the radio and I have been more enlightened on the Bible than in all the churches I ever attended, and know I am getting the truth from your services. I am sure I am only one of the many thousands wherever your voice is hoard. Would you let me know where I could get ‘Judge Rutherford’s book, and also the price, as I would like to have it. Trusting you will still live long to send out God’s message to the people—”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Arlington, N. J. “I’m deeply interested in the addresses given by Judge Rutherford every Sunday morning, especially the ones on prohibition. It is about time someone came to the front and exposed the untruth which the Anti-Saloon League has been broadcasting throughout this nation.

Second, the subject was interesting because of the allimportance of it, and it was so fully established, too. It was practical and, to me, absolutely in keeping with a rational conception of the heart of the Divine.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH’S expressed word to man, which is the Bible, is the authority for the answers to the questions considered on this occasion. Because there are so many questions and the time is so limited I must make the answers brief. I will read the question and give the answer immediately following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> If it is true, as you say, that when one dies he remains dead until the resurrection for judgment, why did Jesus promise the thief on the cross that he should be with Him that day in paradise ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font8"> When an error becomes well entrenched in the mind it is hard to get rid of it. Satan through his agents has seen to it that the people have been taught the falsehood that at death there is merely a change of condition and that the good immediately go to heaven and the bad to torment. This scripture concerning the thief has been greatly misused to support Satan’s lie. Look at the facts now in an unbiased manner. Jesus died upon the cross and was buried, and on the third day thereafter was raised out of death. After He was raised from the dead He said to His followers: “I have not yet ascended to my Father.” Forty days thereafter He did ascend into heaven. It was therefore forty-three days, at least, from the time of the conversation with the thief before Jesus went to heaven. Surely the thief did not go to heaven before Jesus did. There must be some mistake in the claim that Jesus or the thief went to heaven that day. The fact is that the thief did not go to heaven and never will be in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Jesus was being crucified between two thieves. One cursed Him. The other believed that He was the Christ, and said to Him: ‘Master, remember me when you come into your kingdom’; and to that request Jesus replied: T say unto you today, you shall be with me in paradise.’ He did not say, You shall go to paradise today, but His words were: T say unto you today that when I set up my kingdom you shall have a place under it.’ “Paradise” means the restored earth, which will be the home of all those who will then obey Christ, including the thief. In the resurrection the thief will be brought back to earth and have a full opportunity to know the truth, and if he obeys the Lord and follows righteousness he will be restored to perfection and dwell forever in paradise, or the restored earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> My son killed himself. Shall I ever see him again?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Naturally a parent feels great concern about a son who takes life, and the correct answer thereto is a real consolation to such a one. It is not conceivable that a sane person would kill himself. At least, he must be temporarily insane. An insane person is not responsible for his deeds, and therefore the Lord would not hold him responsible. Jesus stated, in John 5: 28, 29: “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection by judgment.” It is also written, in Acts 24:15: “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.” Upon the authority of these scriptures I am glad to say that your son will be awakened out of death, given an opportunity to understand the truth, and then, obeying the truth and following righteousness, will receive the blessings of life and live on the earth forever. Take courage. Trust in the Lord and wait patiently for the fulfilment of His promises. He always keeps His word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Why did not the churches of organized Christianity protest strongly against the wholesale murder that the World War brought upon the people? There was not one of the churches that dared voice a protest. Will you answer why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Anszver:</span><span class="font8"> This is another strong proof that the church denominations do not represent Jehovah God but that they are a part of this world which is under the rule and control of the invisible one Satan the Devil. Almost all of those in the churches remain there because they are ignorant of the truth. The church denominations have grown to be merely political and social organizations, and form a part of this world. Their leaders and teachers do not believe the Bible, and they do not teach it, and of course do not follow its teachings. When war was declared the church denominations rushed forward and advocated the shedding of human blood. They urged the young men to join the army. They did not stop at that. They entered into a conspiracy to destroy everyone who did believe and teach the Bible during the war. They combined against the Bible Students, and cruelly persecuted, illtreated and killed a number of them because they took advantage of the law which Congress enacted affording an opportunity for a conscientious objector to refuse to enter into mortal combat. The clergy .and their allies caused the arrest and prosecution of many men because they taught the truth. I know this because I was included amongst those prosecuted and tried, together with others, in the United States Court before one Judge Howe, upon the false charge of resisting the war. In utter violation of the law Judge Howe directed the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty and then he sentenced us each to eighty years’ imprisonment and caused us to be kept in prison for nine months illegally without bond. When the chief justice of the supreme court of the United States granted bond the government dismissed the cases. Except for the Lord’s interference doubtless we should have been in prison yet. The only “offense” of which any of us was guilty was that of telling the truth to the people, and that without charge, and without a cent for so doing. The record of the many cruel and wicked persecutions carried on by the clergy during that war is set forth in No. 27 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> magazine. The clergy expected to destroy those who were then telling the truth. They should have known better. The truth is mighty and will prevail, because truth proceeds from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Hebrews 12: 23 says: “[We are approaching] the spirits of just men made perfect.” What is the meaning of that scripture?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The apostle is there discussing the assembling of those who will compose God’s organization under Christ and which is called “Zion”. He mentions a company of holy angels and members of the church and then says: “The spirits of just men made perfect.” In the preceding chapter is given a list of men from Abel to John the Baptist all of whom were faithful to God and who died in faith and before the crucifixion of Christ Jesus. God’s promise is that these faithful men shall be resurrected out of death and made the visible representatives of His kingdom on earth. “Just men” means “approved men”. ‘The spirit’ means the life of the creature, including the right to life. Those men proved faithful to God and were by Him counted just oi’ approved. But their right to live could not be given until first the sacrifice of Christ Jesus was made and presented as a sin-offering in heaven. God then selects the members of the body of Christ and after that gathers together those that make up His organization, and these faithful men, being brought forth from the grave and made perfect, are given the right to live upon the earth. Psalm 45:16 is authority for the statement that these men shall be the visible rulers under the kingdom on the earth. Seeing that w<sup>T</sup>e are now “in that day” of the Lord it is confidently expected that within a short time these faithful men will be back on the earth and through them the Lord will direct the affairs of the governments on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Since we have heard your lectures on Sunday mornings and have your books we have not cared to go to church and hear sermons. Your lectures are so’different from them, and we feel that you are right. Please tell us if it is wrong to feel that way and to stay away from the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font8"> The Lord speaks of those as unclean who do not worship Him in truth and in fact. In 2 Corinthians 6:17 it is written: “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.” Your course in refusing to go to the churches is right. It would be proper for you to attend church if the clergymen told about God’s provision for the salvation of the human race through the blood of Christ Jesus and of the vindication of God’s word and name through His kingdom. They do not preach about these things, however. They talk politics and about so-called “science”, and everything except the Bible. Then why go there upon the pretext of serving God and listen to that which does not honor God but which tends to turn the mind of man away from Jehovah God? What the people greatly need above everything else is a knowledge of God’s word of truth as set forth in the Bible. If the preachers sincerely wanted to help the people understand the Bible they -would tell them what -wonderful truths it contains. They not only fail to tell the people the truth of the Bible, but conspire with others to prevent the people from having the truth. Men and women who humbly go from home to home and tell their neighbors about the truth the clergy seek to have arrested and prosecuted in the courts upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the pretext that they are breaking the Sunday law or working without a license. Their real purpose is to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. My advice therefore is that, instead of your wasting time going to the church buildings and listening to the palaver of some man about things other than the Bible, you study your Bibles yourselves, learn of the truth, and then go and tell your neighbors about these wonderful truths and ask them to study the Scriptures with you. Let it be clearly understood that the Bible Students do not want you to join anything. They want to help you get a knowledge of the truth; and when you get that knowledge of the truth it will make you so glad that you will want to tell someone else about it. A knowledge of the truth is beneficial to the people because by it they learn the way to life, and life is what every sane person wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> I was informed by a clergyman that the terms of my consecration to do God’s will mean that I must regularly attend some Catholic or Protestant church service and pay my dues regularly. Is this a part of consecration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The clergyman who told you that, whether ignorant or not, did not tell you the truth. Consecration means an agreement to do God’s will. There is no place in the Scriptures where it says that a man, to perform his consecration vow, must attend either a Catholic or Protestant church and pay his dues. The will of God concerning those who consecrate to do His will is that such shall study His Word, learn the truth, and tell the truth to others that they top may take their stand on the side of God and prepare themselves . for His kingdom. The Apostle Paul never collected dues. In order to support himself he made tents. None of the apostles nor any of the teachers in the early church ever took up any collections. This practice of church attendance and passing the plate or collection box regularly is entirely a human invention and for the benefit of those who profit by it in a pecuniary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Since there is but one God, what---does it mean to be baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Baptism means a full consecration or agreement to be obedient to God’s will. God does His work by and through Christ Jesus, who is His Chief Officer. The holy spirit is the power of God sent forth to perform a work in behalf of His people. Baptism in water is merely a symbol or outward confession that you have agreed to do God’s will. It is proper, therefore, because it is Scriptural, to be baptized in water, symbolizing the real baptism, and to be baptized in the name of God, the Father; in the name of Christ Jesus, His Son; and in the name of the holy spirit or invisible power of God which He sends forth in behalf of His people. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Did the Jews always baptize as John did? And who baptized John?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> No, the Jews did not practice water baptism before the coming of John. The Prophet John baptized for the remission of sins. The Jews were in the law covenant with God, which covenant they had broken, and the breaking of which constituted sin. Any of the Jews having violated their covenant and who repented and desired to come into harmony with God, John the prophet warned to do so and to openly confess their repentance by being baptized in water. John was devoted to God from the time of his birth and never willingly violated the covenant, and it was not necessary for him to be baptized. The baptism of Jesus by John was for an entirely different purpose. The baptism of Jesus symbolically represented that Jesus had agreed to do God’s will; and this is so stated in the fortieth Psalm, verse eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> What is the meaning of Matthew 6:17, which reads: “But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> God hates a hypocrite. You have often seen men assume a sad countenance and speak very meekly, and appear to be suffering, and anxious for it to be known by others that they were suffering and denying themselves for the Lord’s benefit. The real purpose of men’s thus assuming that attitude is to attract the attention of others to them that they may bo looked upon and that someone might say, What a good Christian that man is! They thus deceive the people, and doubtless deceive themselves, but they do not deceive the Lord for a moment. The Lord knows that such men are hypocrites. For this reason Jesus instructed His disciples in these words: “Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear m t unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6:16-18) You may put it down as an infallible rule that when you see one going around and acting in a sanctimonious manner and appearing to be much more holy than others, and calling attention to that fact, such a one is a hypocrite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> How can we worship in spirit and in truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Anszuer:</span><span class="font8"> Those who worship God in spirit and in truth have the spirit, and worship God honestly and truly. It means, therefore, to be in Christ, to have the spirit of Christ, and to honestly and sincerely worship God by the power of God put in His children through Christ. The Jews in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> formal way worshiped at Jerusalem, the capital city of their land, and that was a picture of God’s organization. Christ is the Head of God’s real organization. Those who worship God properly do so by recognizing Christ as their Redeemer and Head and then sincerely serve God by and through the power of Christ to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Did Jesus teach the Lord’s prayer to His disciples only, or to the multitude ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> He taught that prayer to His disciples only, but for the benefit of all who should thereafter believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be brought into full harmony with God through Christ Jesus. None other properly utter that prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Can we truly call ourselves God’s children even though we are sinners ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font8"> If willingly committing sin, No. The child of God while on earth is imperfect and cannot always do just the right thing. It is written in 1 John 2:1: “These things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate, .. . Christ Jesus the righteous.” He is the One who advocates with Jehovah for those who are His followers; and it is further written that God is just and faithful to forgive our sins if we confess them to Him and ask forgiveness by and through Christ Jesus. But if one who claims to be a son of God deliberately commits sin, that proves that he does not have God’s favor and he can no longer be properly called a child of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> What is the unpardonable sin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> It is any act willingly done or committed against the light of the truth that has been received from the Lord. To repudiate the blood of Christ Jesus as the redemptive price of man constitutes such a sin. Where one has a knowledge that God will have a kingdom of righteousness and that Christ Jesus is King, and then openly denies or opposes that kingdom, such one commits the unpardonable sin. Concerning this, Jesus said, in Matthew 12:32: “Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the holy spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” This scripture means that a man might ignorantly speak against Christ, but if one first receives the light by receiving a knowledge through the spirit of God, and knows the truth, and then deliberately goes contrary thereto he is sinning against light, hence sinning against the holy spirit. The Pharisees or clergymen knew that Jesus was the Messiah, and yet they deliberately persecuted Him, connived at His death, and caused Him to be put to death. Their punishment will not be merely because of what they did against Jesus, but because they knew that they were persecuting God’s beloved Son. They were willingly and maliciously sinning against the light of truth. There are those today who are carrying the message of God’s kingdom to the people. A man who knows that these are honestly serving the Lord and then illtreats such and persecutes them sins against the light and is committing a sin against the holy spirit. If, however, he ignorantly does injury to one of God’s witnesses, and does not do so merely because that one is representing God, he is not committing sin against the holy spirit. God shows clearly in His Word that the unpardonable sin is to willingly oppose what one knows is a right work. The clergymen of the land ought to know that every man who is trying to inform others about God’s kingdom is doing a work to the honor of the Lord. They must bear the responsibility before God for persecuting His faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> The Bible states that God knows everything from the beginning. Then why did God appoint Lucifer the overlord of man when He knew that Lucifer was going to bring disaster upon mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aziswer:</span><span class="font8"> God never coerces any creature to do that which is right. He sets right before His creature, and then permits that creature to take his own course. When God appointed Lucifer to the high position of overseer of man Lucifer was a perfect creature. Lucifer was ambitious to have the worship of creatures for himself even as God rightfully has. To accomplish this selfish purpose he rebelled against God. God did not restrain him from taking that wrongful course, but He did pronounce His judgment upon it. Lucifer was thereafter called Satan, and he challenged God’s Word and said in substance that God could not put a man on earth who would hold fast his integrity to God. Jehovah then let Satan go his length in wickedness, and now God’s due time approaches when He will prove to all creation that His Word is true and that He is supreme, and that those who live must obey Him and do right. All creation must be brought to a knowledge of the truth and be given an opportunity to do right and live or to do wrong and die. The time has come for the truth to be taught to the people. It is the privilege of every one who learns the truth to tell it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> When is there to be any relief for the people? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> There never can be and never will be relief for the people by reason of what the governments of the earth do foi’ them. Satan is the great oppressor and the invisible ruler of the world. The people suffer under his rule. Soon Christ shall completely destroy Satan’s organization and power and put in operation His own kingdom of righteousness; and then, and only then, will there come complete relief for the people from their burdens. For that reason the truth is all-important to the people. Every man and woman who knows the truth should tell it to their neighbors and friends. Bo this, and do it unselfishly and because you love the truth, and the Lord will greatly bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Concerning the statement about the rich man’s being unable to enter the kingdom of heaven: Is it right for a -workingman to own a house, without any debt on it, and to save a little money ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> In Romans 12:17 it is written: “Provide things honest in the sight of all men.” In 1 Timothy 5: 8 it is written: “But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.” It is both right and honest and the duty of every man to provide, if possible, a house for himself and family to live in and to keep himself free from debt. The injustice practiced amongst men, however, makes this impossible with the majority of the people. The acquiring of a home and a little money is not growing rich nor laying up treasure on earth, within the meaning of the Scriptures. One who does not provide for his family, if he can do so, is worse than an unbeliever. After a man has made a reasonable provision for his family, then his substance should be devoted to doing good to others; but the best way of doing that is to do it according to God’s Word, by enabling others to get a knowledge of the truth. Such is the course of the real Christian. The Bible Students do not constitute a church organization, as that term is generally understood. They are men and women who are anxious to do right and, above all, to serve God. The clergy and their allies cannot understand how the Bible Students get the money to carry on their work, since they never take up a collection. Those who really have the truth and appreciate it have the love of the truth, and all their substance they regard as belonging to the Lord. After they have provided the things necessary for themselves and dependent ones, then they are anxious to use their substance in making known the truth of God’s Word to others and they do not need to be asked to use their money for that purpose. For that reason they spend their time and their own money to visit their neighbors and go from house to house on Sunday mornings to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom by taking to the people the message of truth in book form. The little money they take for the books is used to print more books. If you love the Lord and want to see others have the truth, you will appreciate why these men and women do this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Why do the Bible Students call at the homes of the people on Sunday? and why do the preachers oppose them in doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Anszver:</span><span class="font8"> During the working days of the week these Christian people must work to earn money to support themselves and dependent ones. On Sunday the people have more time to listen. Sunday is a good time to hear about God and His Word. The Bible Students are preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, that the people may know the truth. Sunday is one of the best days for them to do this. They are violating no law in doing it. They are obeying God’s law by loing if. If they were going from house to house Sunday morning to take up a collection for the preachers, you would never hear an objection made by any of them for that. Because they are telling’ the people the truth the clergy object, for the reason that they know that the truth will expose them and they therefore fear losing their position if the people get the truth. The question now is, Do the people want the clergy to do their thinking for them and their children or do they want to think for themselves? The people do not receive any help or relief from the clergy and their organizations. The people must help each other to get a knowledge of God’s Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> If Christ died for the sins of the world why do we find so many sinful people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The answer to that question is found in 1 Timothy 2: 3-6, which says that the blood of Christ Jesus provides redemption or salvation for all who accept and believe it. All must be brought to a knowledge of the truth. It is through the kingdom that God provides the way to give all a knowledge of the truth. His kingdom is at hand, and now the people must learn the truth. They are born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and the only way to get away therefrom is to know God’s truth .and to obey Him. When the kingdom of the Lord is in full sway unrighteousness will cease for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Please explain these words of John 14: Tn my Father’s house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. If I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font8"> In Jehovah’s universal organization there are many departments or places. Long ago God announced His purpose to form a new creation, with Christ Jesus as the Head thereof. Jesus must first die to provide the ransom price. He ascended on high, and since then God through Him has been preparing His kingdom. There will be with Jesus in His kingdom 144,000 who have been called, chosen and proven faithful. These, together with Christ Jesus, will constitute the heavenly ruling class of God’s organization, through which kingdom class God will administer blessings to all the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Here is a question propounded by a mountaineer of Carolina. I spent a winter in those mountains and can somewhat appreciate the condition of the people there. The question reads: Will Christ’s kingdom relieve us mountaineers from the oppression of Big Business and politics ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The Scriptures answer that question, Yes. God’s kingdom will bring complete relief to the mountaineers and to all others who have a desire for righteousness. In the Scriptures Satan’s organization visible to man is called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“a</span><span class="font8"> beast”. That organization is made up of Big Business, professional politicians, and hypocritical religionists. The mountaineers, as well as those who live in the valleys, work hard to provide the things decent in the sight of man and God, and the beastly organization takes it away from them. Here is what the Lord says about the conditions in His kingdom: In Isaiah 35:8, 9, we read: “An highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those; the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there.” In Psalm 72: 4,5 He says: “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.” He says, in Isaiah 25: 6, that He will spread a great feast for the people. In Isaiah 26:9 the Lord declares that under the rule of Christ the people shall learn righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The greatest and most important truth ever spoken or written concerning Christ is that of and concerning the kingdom of God. A knowledge of that truth is paramount in importance to all creatures. Belief can come to the people in no other way than through His kingdom. The kingdom of God will fully and completely demonstrate to all that Jehovah is supreme, that He is •wholly unselfish, that His Word is true, and that His name is worthy of all praise. In His name I call upon the people to cease their mad rush for material wealth and physical pleasure and to abandon the fraudulent and false organizations and theii' teachers that mislead and oppress them and to turn their attention to diligently acquiring a knowledge of the truth of God’s Word. There is no other hope for the human race. There is hope and complete relief for the people through God’s kingdom. Next Sunday, by His grace, I will speak concerning hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Running Fits” in Dogs </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By W. C. Harman, M. I). (Va.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font8">N AN issue of your valuable magazine I read an item “Demonism in Dogs”. This was a news item from England. A few days later I saw an article in our local paper describing about the same thing here in Virginia. I thought something on this subject might be of interest to dog lovers and dog owners, although I have nothing of much benefit to offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the past ten years we have had a disease in southside Virginia, affecting hunting dogs, particularly hounds and bird dogs, which for want of a better name we call “running fits”. The dog, without showing previous symptoms, will start running, usually in a circle, and usually yelping. He shows momentary intelligence if spoken to, but keeps up his running for some time, usually seeking a dark place, as under a building, where he will lie, with glassy eyes, sometimes for hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sometimes they will start to run and fall down and jerk and froth at the mouth, having a typical convulsion as of an epileptic child. This disease, as in a child, if it occurs in a young dog, will ruin its mind, and, if in a young dog or a weakly one, usually kills it sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Veterinarians report that dogs dying of this disease have been carefully dissected, but that no pathology could be found to account for the symptoms. The disease has been attributed to intestinal worms, but post-mortem findings have not confirmed this. This disease has become so widespread in southside Virginia that it is almost impossible to raise a hunting dog. I have found that the same treatment as would be given to an epileptic human creature is of some benefit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Give purgative pills or castor oil once or twice a week, and a daily dose of sodium bromide until all symptoms disappear. Pheno Barbital is also of benefit in one-grain doses daily. Dogs should be fed a mixed diet, and the feeding of white-flour bread should be avoided.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Since that time our office has been flooded with coupons asking for the author’s edition of this book.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark16"></a>And the Reason Is</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">that for centuries people who have read the Bible have wanted to know about REVELATION. More now than ever before do they want to understand it. For instance, you have often wondered about the ‘seven messengers to the churches’ and the ‘book sealed with seven seals’; about Revelation 11:3, where it reads, “I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.” And then that wonderful thirteenth chapter, where we read, “And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea.” Probably you have wondered what this beast represents, with its “seven heads and ten horns”. Then there are other beasts mentioned in Revelation: the “scarlet coloured beast” and the “image of the beast”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'This book explains everything in Revelation logically, clearly and concisely. And then the author adds an explanation of the second chapter of Daniel, truly a most marvelous explanation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. You will enjoy every page of this book. These are some of the reasons why so many people are interested in Revelation. We feel sure that all will enjoy it. You will want to read it not only once, but twice; yes, three times. The author’s edition is now ready, containing a letter to its readers by the author. Book One and Book Two will be mailed to you, postpaid, anywhere, upon receipt of $1.</span></p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>1-2. </strong>(a) Why is Armageddon good news for mankind? (b) What questions will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">HAVE you heard people apply the word “Armageddon” to a nuclear war or an environmental disaster? In contrast, what the Bible says about Armageddon involves good news, a cause for happiness! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 1:3</a>) The war of Armageddon will not destroy but save mankind! How so?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Bible shows that the war of Armageddon will save mankind by ending human rule. That war will save mankind by removing the wicked and preserving the righteous. And it will save mankind by protecting our planet from ruin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>) To help us understand these points more clearly, let us consider four questions: What is Armageddon? What events will lead up to it? How can we be among those who will be saved at Armageddon? How can we remain faithful as Armageddon draws near?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>(a) What does the word “Armageddon” mean? (b) Based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 16</a>, why can we say that Armageddon is not a literal place?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 16:14,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <strong>16</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The word “Armageddon” appears just once in the Scriptures, and it comes from a Hebrew term that means “Mountain of Megiddo.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 16:16</a>; ftn.) Megiddo was a city in ancient Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11</a>) But Armageddon does not refer to any literal <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>place on earth. Strictly speaking, it refers to the situation to which “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” are gathered in opposition to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14</a>) However, in this article, we will also use the term “Armageddon” to refer to the war that immediately follows the gathering of the kings of the earth. How do we know that Armageddon refers to a symbolic place? First, there is no literal mountain of Megiddo. Second, the area around Megiddo is far too small to hold “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” and their armies and war machines. Third, as we will see later in this article, the war of Armageddon will begin when the world’s “kings” attack God’s people, who are scattered throughout the earth.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why did God connect his final great war with Megiddo?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Why did Jehovah connect the final great war with Megiddo? Megiddo and the nearby Jezreel Valley were the sites of many battles. On occasion, Jehovah directly intervened in those battles. For example, “by the waters of Megiddo,” God helped Israelite Judge Barak defeat a Canaanite army led by a chief named Sisera. Barak and the prophetess Deborah thanked Jehovah for their miraculous victory. They sang: “From heaven the stars fought . . . against Sisera. The torrent of Kishon washed them away.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:19-7:5:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judg. 5:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>In what important way will the war of Armageddon differ from the battle that Barak fought?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Barak and Deborah ended their song with the words: “So let all your enemies perish, O Jehovah, but let those who love you be like the sun rising in its glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:31-7:5:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 5:31</a>) At Armageddon, God’s enemies will likewise perish, while those who love God will be saved. But there is one important difference between the two conflicts. At Armageddon, God’s people will not fight. They will not even be armed! Their “strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust” in Jehovah and his heavenly armies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:15-23:30:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 30:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:11-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How may Jehovah defeat his enemies at Armageddon?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How will God defeat his enemies at Armageddon? He may use any number of ways. For example, he may use earthquakes, hail, and lightning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:22-18:38:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:19-26:38:22" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezek. 38:19-22</a>) He may turn his enemies against one another.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:36-23:37:36" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 37:36</a>) Whatever means God uses, his victory will be complete. All his enemies will be destroyed. And all the righteous will be saved.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:25-20:3:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 3:25, 26</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>That will be the foretold proclamation of “peace and security.” Why will world leaders say that? Will religious <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>leaders participate? Possibly. Nevertheless, the proclamation will be just another demon-inspired lie. But this lie will be especially dangerous because it will give people a false sense of security just before the greatest tribulation in human history begins. Yes, “sudden destruction is to be instantly on them, just like birth pains on a pregnant woman.” What about Jehovah’s loyal servants? They may be surprised by the sudden start of Jehovah’s day, but they will not be caught off guard.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>In what order will God destroy Satan’s world?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah will not wipe out Satan’s entire world all at once, as he did in Noah’s day. Rather, he will destroy it in two main stages. First, he will destroy Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. Then, at Armageddon, he will destroy the rest of Satan’s world, including its political, military, and commercial systems. Let us take a closer look at those two major events.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:1" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:6-66:17:6" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 6 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 18:24</a>, why will Jehovah destroy Babylon the Great?</p>

The ten horns represent the current political powers supporting that organization. At God’s appointed time, those political powers will turn on symbolic Babylon. They “will make her devastated and naked” by plundering her wealth and exposing her wickedness.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:3-46:8:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:3</a>) How so? Because to be “known by him” can mean having God’s approval.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>“The good news about our Lord Jesus” includes all the truths that Jesus <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>taught, as found in God’s Word. We obey the good news when we apply it in our lives. That obedience includes keeping Kingdom interests in first place, living by God’s righteous standards, and announcing God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 24:14</a>) It also includes supporting Christ’s anointed brothers as they care for their weighty responsibilities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:40" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-40</a>.</p>

Before the war of Armageddon begins, all of the 144,000 will have been raised to heaven as immortal spirits. They will then be part of the heavenly armies that will crush Gog and safeguard “a great crowd” of sheeplike ones.

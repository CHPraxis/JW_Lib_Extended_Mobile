<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">WHO do you think should set the standards for what is good and what is bad? When Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, they sent a clear message: They did not trust Jehovah and his standards. They chose to set their own standards of good and bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 3:22</a>) But look at what they lost. They lost their friendship with Jehovah. They also lost the opportunity to live forever, and they passed sin and death on to their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Adam and Eve’s choice led to misery.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Compare the way Adam and Eve behaved with the way that the Ethiopian eunuch responded when Philip preached to him. The eunuch appreciated so much what Jehovah and Jesus had done for him that he immediately got baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:34-44:8:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:34-38</a>) When we dedicate ourselves to God and, like that eunuch, get baptized, we send a clear message. We show that we appreciate what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us. We also show that we trust Jehovah and recognize that he is the one who should set the standard of good and bad.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Think of the blessings we receive when we serve Jehovah! For one thing, we have the prospect of eventually gaining all that Adam and Eve lost, including the opportunity <span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>to live forever. Because of our faith in Jesus Christ, Jehovah forgives our mistakes and gives us a clean conscience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:43-44:10:43" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 10:43</a>) We also become part of Jehovah’s family of approved servants with a blessed future ahead of us.

What might prevent them from getting baptized? And how can they overcome those challenges?</p>

His father has an excellent reputation as a caring father and an effective elder. Yet, Avery held back from getting baptized. Why? “I did not think that I would be able to live up to my father’s reputation,” he says. Avery also lacked confidence that he would be able to handle responsibilities that he might be given in the future. “I worried about being asked to pray in public, to give talks, or to lead a group in the field service.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Hannah, aged 18, suffered from a severe lack of confidence. She was raised by parents who serve Jehovah. Even so, she doubted that she could live by Jehovah’s standards. Why? Hannah had developed a very low opinion of herself. At times, she felt so bad that she would deliberately injure herself, which only made things worse. “I never told anyone about what I did, not even my parents,” she says, “and I imagined that Jehovah would never want me because of what I was doing to myself.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Adam and Eve chose not to serve Jehovah because they failed to develop a strong love for him. Even so, Jehovah allowed them to live long enough to have children and to set their own standards for raising those children. The results of Adam and Eve’s decision to be independent of Jehovah soon made it clear how foolish they had been. Their oldest son murdered his innocent brother, and in time violence and selfishness dominated the human family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:8-1:4:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 6:11-13</a>) All the while, Jehovah had a means to save all of Adam and Eve’s children who want to serve him.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>Continue learning about Jehovah. </strong>The more you learn about Jehovah, the more confident you will become that you can serve him successfully. Avery, mentioned earlier, says: “I gained confidence by reading about and meditating on the promise found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 19:7</strong></a><strong>.” </strong><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>(Read.) </strong>When Avery saw how Jehovah fulfilled that assurance, his love for God grew stronger. Love not only builds confidence but also helps us to focus on Jehovah and on what he wants. Hannah, mentioned earlier, says: “Through my personal Bible reading and study, I came to realize that when I hurt myself, I hurt Jehovah as well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7</a>) Hannah became a ‘doer of God’s word.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22</a>) With what result? She says: “When I saw how obeying Jehovah benefited me, I developed a strong love for him. Now I’m sure that Jehovah will always guide me when I need his help.” Hannah was able to overcome the urge to hurt herself. She dedicated herself to Jehovah and got baptized.</p>

So she ended the friendship. But Vanessa did more. She worked hard to make new friends, inside the congregation. She says that the example set by Noah and his family helped her. “They were surrounded by people who didn’t love Jehovah,” she says, “but they had good association with one another.” After she got baptized, Vanessa became a pioneer. She now says, “This has helped me to make good friends not only in my own congregation but also in other congregations.” You too can make good friends by being as involved as possible in the work that Jehovah has assigned us to do.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>Have a balanced view of fear. </strong>Some kinds of fear are good for us. For example, we need to have a healthy fear of displeasing Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10</a>) If Adam and Eve had developed that type of fear, they would not have rebelled against Jehovah. But they did rebel. After they did so, their eyes were opened in that they became fully aware <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>that they were sinners. They could only pass sin and death on to their children. Because they could see, or understand, their condition, they became ashamed of their nakedness and covered themselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:7-1:3:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 3:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:21-1:3:21" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>While we need to have a healthy fear of Jehovah, we do not need to have a morbid fear of death. Jehovah has made a way for us to gain everlasting life. If we commit a sin but are genuinely repentant, Jehovah will overlook our mistakes. He will forgive us in line with our faith in the ransom sacrifice of his Son. A primary way we show faith is by dedicating our life to God and getting baptized.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:21</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We have many reasons to love Jehovah.

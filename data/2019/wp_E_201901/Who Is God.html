<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><em>Many people say that they believe in God. But ask who God is, and you will get different answers. To some, God is a harsh judge, bent on punishing people for their misdeeds. To others, he is always loving and forgiving, no matter what they do. Still others believe that God is far away and disinterested in us. Given such conflicting views, many may feel that it is simply impossible to know who God is.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Does it matter? </strong>Yes, it does. Knowing God better can add purpose and meaning to your life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:26-28</a>) The closer you draw to God, the more he will love and help you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) Ultimately, having accurate knowledge of God can lead to unending life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>How can you come to know God? </strong>Think of someone you know well, such as a close friend. How did that friendship develop? Likely you got to know that person’s name, personality, likes and dislikes, as well as what he or she has done and plans to do, and more. This is what drew you to that person​—you <em>learned about </em>him or her.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>Similarly, we can come to know God by considering the following:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  WHAT IS GOD’S NAME?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  WHAT IS HE LIKE?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  WHAT HAS GOD DONE?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  WHAT WILL HE DO?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">  WHAT CAN KNOWING GOD MEAN FOR YOU?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This magazine is designed to provide Bible answers to those questions. The articles will help you learn not only who God is but also what is in store for you as you come into a personal relationship with him.</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Do You Perceive God’s Invisible Qualities?




When you look at a colorful flower, a starry sky, or a thundering waterfall, do you see the handiwork of the Creator? The creation around us clearly reveals Jehovah’s invisible qualities. (Ro 1:20) By pausing to reflect on what we see with our eyes, we are able to perceive God’s power, love, wisdom, and justice, as well as his generosity.​—Ps 104:24.
What are some of Jehovah’s creative works that you notice each day? Even if you live in a city, you may see birds or trees. Observing intently Jehovah’s creation can help us to reduce anxiety, put our problems in proper perspective, and increase our faith in Jehovah’s ability to care for us throughout eternity. (Mt 6:25-32) If you have children, help them to perceive Jehovah’s matchless qualities. As we grow in appreciation for the creation around us, we will draw closer to the Creator.​—Ps 8:3, 4.

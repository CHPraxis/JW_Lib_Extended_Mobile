<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>WHY IMPORTANT: </strong>People must call on the name of Jehovah in order to be saved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ro 10:13, 14</a>) Yet, not everyone who agrees to study the Bible wants to live by Jehovah’s standards. We make the best use of our precious time in the ministry by helping those who truly want to make changes to please Jehovah. If a Bible student does not make meaningful progress after a reasonable period of time, we wisely redirect our efforts to those whom Jehovah is drawing to him and his organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 6:44</a>) Of course, if at a future time the person gives evidence of being “rightly disposed for everlasting life,” we gladly resume his Bible study.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 13:48</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Kindly discuss Jesus’ illustration of the sower, and ask him to consider what may be holding him back.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mt 13:18-23</a></p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Keep Eagerly Waiting With Endurance




How long have you been waiting for God’s Kingdom to come? Have you been enduring patiently despite hardship? (Ro 8:25) Some Christians face hatred, mistreatment, imprisonment, or even the threat of death. Many others cope with such trials as chronic illness or advancing age.
What will help us to wait eagerly in the face of any trial? We must feed our faith daily with Bible reading and meditation. We must focus on our hope. (2Co 4:16-18; Heb 12:2) We must supplicate Jehovah in prayer and beg him for the power of his holy spirit. (Lu 11:10, 13; Heb 5:7) Our loving Father can help us “endure fully with patience and joy.”​—Col 1:11.

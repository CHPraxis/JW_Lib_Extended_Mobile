Are You “Waiting With Eager Expectation”?




8:19-21
  “The creation”: mankind with the earthly hope

  “The revealing of the sons of God”: when the anointed ones share with Christ in destroying Satan’s wicked system of things

  “The basis of hope”: Jehovah’s promise of deliverance through Jesus’ death and resurrection

  “Set free from enslavement to corruption”: the gradual deliverance from the effects of sin and death










How can you show that you are “waiting with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God”?
  Diligently study the Bible, and pray for holy spirit

  Take full advantage of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions

  Do not let Satan deceive you into thinking that God’s ways are unduly restrictive

  Live the truth; make it your own

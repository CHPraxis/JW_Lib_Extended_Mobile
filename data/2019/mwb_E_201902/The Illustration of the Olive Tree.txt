The Illustration of the Olive Tree




11:16-26
What do the various features of the symbolic olive tree represent?





  The tree: the fulfillment of God’s purpose regarding the Abrahamic covenant

  The trunk: Jesus, the principal part of Abraham’s offspring

  The branches: the full number of the secondary part of Abraham’s offspring


The “broken off” branches: natural Jews who rejected Jesus

The “grafted in” branches: spirit-anointed Christians out of the nations


As foretold, Abraham’s offspring​—Jesus and the 144,000—​will bring blessings “to people of the nations.”​—Ro 11:12; Ge 22:18
What do I learn about Jehovah from the way he fulfilled his purpose regarding Abraham’s offspring?

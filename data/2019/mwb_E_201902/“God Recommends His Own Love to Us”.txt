TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ROMANS 4-6
“God Recommends His Own Love to Us”




5:8, 18, 21
Jehovah’s gift of the ransom addresses issues of universal importance, such as the vindication of his name and sovereignty. But the ransom also enables us to have a righteous standing before Jehovah now and offers the prospect of a happy future for all obedient mankind.
How can we show our gratitude for the gift of the ransom?





  Dedication and baptism show that we have faith in the ransom and that we want to belong to Jehovah






  Preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom shows that we imitate Jehovah’s far-reaching love for people.​—Mt 22:39; Joh 3:16


In what other ways can I show my gratitude to Jehovah for the gift of the ransom?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">ON THE night before our Lord Jesus was put to death, he said that all who choose to be his disciples will be hated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:14</a>) Up until now, faithful Christian Witnesses of Jehovah have been persecuted by those who oppose true worship.

We do not need to imagine all the things that could happen to us. If we did, we could be overwhelmed with fear and anxiety.

If we allow small obstacles to keep us from attending meetings now, what will happen in the future if we have to risk our safety to meet with fellow believers? On the other hand, if we develop a firm resolve to attend meetings, we will not give in when opposers try to stop us from gathering together. Now is the time to develop a love for our meetings. When we love to attend meetings, no opposition, not even a government ban, will stop us from obeying God rather than men.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

(b) What important lesson do we learn from David’s example?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>To face persecution, you need courage. If you feel that you lack that quality, what can you do? Remember that true courage does not depend on your size, strength, or ability. Consider the example of young David when he faced Goliath. Compared with that giant, David was smaller, weaker, and poorly armed. David did not even have a sword. Yet, he was full of courage. David boldly ran to fight that arrogant giant.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Why was David so courageous? He firmly believed that Jehovah was with him. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:37-9:17:37" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 17:37,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:47" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> <strong>45-47</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>David did not concentrate on how big Goliath was compared with him.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>We do not know when a wave of persecution or even an outright ban will affect our worship of Jehovah. However, we do know that we can prepare now by strengthening our relationship with Jehovah, by building up our courage, and by learning to cope with hatred from men. The preparations that we make now will help us stand firm in the future.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But what if a ban on our worship does come? In the following article, we will discuss principles that will help us continue serving Jehovah even when under ban.</p>

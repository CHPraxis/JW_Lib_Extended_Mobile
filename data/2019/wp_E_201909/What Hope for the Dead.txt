What Hope for the Dead?









Death affects every one of us. But does death end it all? Are the dead forgotten forever? Is there any hope for the dead?



CONSIDER WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS:

THE DEAD ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
“All those in the memorial tombs will . . . come out.”​—John 5:28, 29.

God remembers the dead; those in his memory will come back to life.
THERE WILL BE A RESURRECTION ON EARTH
“There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”​—Acts 24:15.

Billions will be brought back to life with the hope of living forever in an abundance of peace.
THE RESURRECTION HOPE IS BELIEVABLE
“[God] counts the number of the stars; he calls all of them by name.”​—Psalm 147:4.

Being able to call all the stars by name, God can easily remember people whom he will resurrect.

The earth should have been filled with people who respect the Creator’s sovereignty, benefit from his guidance, and reflect his loving personality.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong>How can you find the road to life? </strong>There are many religions, but Jesus warned: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:21" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21</a>) He also said: “By their fruits you will recognize them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:16-40:7:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 7:16</a>) The Bible can help you identify true worship and distinguish it from false worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>How can you follow the road to life? </strong>It involves getting to know the Source of life: Who is he? What is his name? What is he like?

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God wants humans to do more than merely work, eat, play, and raise a family. We can know our Creator and become his friend. We can show that we love him by doing his will.

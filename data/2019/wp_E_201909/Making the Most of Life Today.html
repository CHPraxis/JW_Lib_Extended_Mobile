<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>FINDING CONTENTMENT</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>The Bible’s advice: </strong>“Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The world today bombards us with countless must-have products and services. Yet, the Bible says that we can be “content with the present things.” How?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Avoid “the love of money.” </strong>People sacrifice health, family, friendships, morals, even their dignity​—all for “the love of money.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:10-54:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) What a high price to pay! In the end, a lover of wealth “will never be satisfied.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Value people, not things</strong>. Granted, material things have their place. But things cannot love or appreciate us; only people can do that. Having “a true friend” contributes to our contentment in life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>COPING WITH POOR HEALTH</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>The Bible’s advice: </strong>“A joyful heart is good medicine.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 17:22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Like “good medicine,” joy can help us to cope with poor health. But how can we find joy when we suffer from poor health?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Be appreciative</strong>. If we dwell on our afflictions, “all the days” will appear bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:15</a>) Instead, “show yourselves thankful,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:15</a>) Learn to appreciate the good things in life, however small. A beautiful sunset, a gentle breeze, the smile of a loved one​—these things can enrich our life.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Do things for others. </strong>Even if our health is not good, “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) When others appreciate our efforts, we feel a warm glow of satisfaction, and this takes our mind off our problems. We can make our life better by helping others to make their life better.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>The Bible’s advice: </strong>“Make sure of the more important things.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 1:10</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Couples who spend little time together risk drifting apart. Husbands and wives are thus wise to give priority to their marriage​—one of the <em>more </em>important things in life.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Do things together. </strong>Instead of pursuing personal interests alone, why not plan on doing things together? “Two are better than one,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:9-21:4:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>) Together, you can cook a meal, exercise, relax over a beverage, or take up a hobby.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Express your love</strong>. The Bible encourages a husband and a wife to love and respect each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 33</a>) A warm smile, a loving embrace, or a small gift can do much to strengthen a marriage. Of course, spouses should reserve expressions of sexual intimacy only for each other.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc"><strong>—Told by Ryoko Miyamoto, Japan.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sc">Life was hard. My husband abused alcohol and could not keep a job. He abandoned his responsibilities as father to our four children. No matter how hard I worked, there seemed to be no light at the end of the tunnel. I wondered, ‘Was this fate, or was this punishment for sins I had committed in a previous life?’</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sc">Then, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door. With a warm smile, she spoke enthusiastically about God’s Kingdom and everlasting life. She offered me a Bible study. I soon learned that God exists and that he is wise, just, and loving. I also learned about the condition of the dead and that my sufferings were not due to fate.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sc">Above all, I came to appreciate that a truly satisfying life is built on a relationship with God. Knowing Bible truth has brought me much encouragement, freedom, and refreshment. At last, I found purpose in life!</p>

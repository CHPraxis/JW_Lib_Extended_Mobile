If you feel that it would be unwise to give your own address, you may use the Kingdom Hall address if the elders give you permission to do so. However, you should NEVER use the address of the branch office as your return address.</p>

<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Give attention to proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. The letter should look neat, not messy. If it is handwritten, it should be easy to read. The wording should be neither too casual nor too formal.</p>

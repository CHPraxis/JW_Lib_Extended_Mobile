TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | 1 CORINTHIANS 1-3
Are You a Physical Man or a Spiritual Man?




2:14-16
Each of us needs to cultivate spirituality and keep growing as a spiritual person. (Eph 4:23, 24) In order to make progress, you must feed yourself spiritually, set spiritual goals, and cultivate the fruitage of the spirit.





How does your spirituality now compare with your spirituality a year ago, ten years ago, or when you got baptized?

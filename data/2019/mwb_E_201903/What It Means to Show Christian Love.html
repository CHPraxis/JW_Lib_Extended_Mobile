<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">When someone wrongs us, Christian love requires that we go beyond simply not retaliating. “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:20-45:12:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 12:20</a>) The kindness that we show to someone who has mistreated us may even cause that person to regret his or her actions.</p>

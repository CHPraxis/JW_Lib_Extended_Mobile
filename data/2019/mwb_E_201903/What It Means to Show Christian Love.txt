What It Means to Show Christian Love




12:10, 17-21
When someone wrongs us, Christian love requires that we go beyond simply not retaliating. “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.” (Ro 12:20) The kindness that we show to someone who has mistreated us may even cause that person to regret his or her actions.





How did you feel when someone you inadvertently hurt responded kindly?

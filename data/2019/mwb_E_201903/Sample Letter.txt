LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Sample Letter




  Use your own return address. If you feel that it would be unwise to give your own address, you may use the Kingdom Hall address if the elders give you permission to do so. However, you should NEVER use the address of the branch office as your return address.

  Use the personâ€™s name if you know it. This will avoid giving the impression that the letter is a commercial advertisement.

  Give attention to proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. The letter should look neat, not messy. If it is handwritten, it should be easy to read. The wording should be neither too casual nor too formal.


The included sample letter illustrates these points. It is not meant to be copied word for word each time you write someone in your territory. Tailor your letter according to its purpose and local circumstances and customs.

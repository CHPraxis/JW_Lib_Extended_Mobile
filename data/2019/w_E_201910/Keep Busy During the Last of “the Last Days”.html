<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We know some things about the declaration of “peace and security.” However, other things we do not know. We do not know what will lead up to it or how the declaration will be made. And we do not know whether it will involve just one proclamation or a series of announcements.

For example, we need to be alert to the danger of compromising our neutrality by getting drawn into the world’s political issues. If we were to get involved, we could become “part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>) We know that God’s Kingdom is the only hope for world peace.</p>

We need to make sure that we are “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) Jesus foretold what we would do. When he spoke about all the significant things that would happen during the last days, he added: “Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:4-41:13:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:8-41:13:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>) Just think: Every time you go in the ministry, you are having a share in fulfilling that Bible prophecy!</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>What can we say about the progress of the Kingdom-preaching work? Year by year, this work is moving ahead. For example, think about the increase in the number of Kingdom proclaimers worldwide during the last days. In 1914, there were 5,155 publishers in 43 lands. Today, there are some 8.5 million publishers in 240 lands! Even so, our work is not yet over. We must keep proclaiming God’s Kingdom as the only solution to all mankind’s problems.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:11-19:145:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 145:11-13</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>) How can we help these people before it is too late?</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Through his organization, Jehovah is giving us all that we need to teach people the truth. For example, we receive training each week at <strong><em>the midweek meeting. </em></strong>This meeting helps us know what to say on initial calls and return visits.

(Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > ONLINE LESSONS.) Why were these lessons created? Each month, tens of thousands of people around the world search the Internet for Bible lessons. The lessons on our website can introduce these people to the truth of God’s Word. Some of the people you talk to may be hesitant to accept a personal Bible study. If so, show them this feature on our website or send them a link to the lessons.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span></p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Our Online Bible Study Lessons cover these subjects: “The Bible and Its Author,” “The Bible’s Main Characters,” and “The Bible’s Message of Hope.” Within those subjects, they teach:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="su">  How the Bible can help a person</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The online lessons do not replace the Bible study arrangement. Jesus has given us the privilege of making disciples. We hope that interested ones will go through the online lessons, appreciate what they learn, and want to learn more. If so, perhaps they will accept a Bible study. At the end of each lesson, the reader is invited to submit a request for a personal instructor to study the Bible with him. Through our website, on average worldwide, we are receiving over 230 Bible study requests each day! That personal one-on-one instruction is vital!</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14-17</a>) For example, he would not be an employee of a church. Furthermore, a Christian who is employed by some other business would not want to do extensive work at a facility that promotes false worship. And if he owns a business, he would certainly not bid on a job or do contract work for any part of Babylon the Great. Why do we take such a firm stand? Because we do not want to share in the works and sins of religious organizations <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>that are unclean in God’s eyes.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11</a>.<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span></p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Years ago, a self-employed elder was asked by a contractor to accept a small carpentry job at a church in the town where the brother lived. The contractor knew that the brother had always said he would not work on churches. But this time the contractor was desperate to find someone for the job. Even so, the brother stuck to Bible principles and declined the work. The next week, the local newspaper showed a photograph of another carpenter attaching a cross to the church. If our brother had compromised his stand, it could have been his picture in the paper. Think of how damaging that would have been to his reputation among his fellow Christians!

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p51" data-pid="51">Soon we expect to hear the nations claim that they have achieved “peace and security!” That will be the signal that the great tribulation is about to begin. What does Jehovah expect us to do between now and then? This article will help us find the answer.</p></div>
<div><p id="p52" data-pid="52">For example, on its website the United Nations claims to “maintain international peace and security.”</p></div>
<div><p id="p53" data-pid="53">See the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2019601/">God’s Judgments​—Does He Always Give Enough Warning?</a>” in this issue.</p></div>
<div><p id="p54" data-pid="54">For details on how to use the items in the Teaching Toolbox, see the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2018604/">Teaching the Truth</a>” in the October 2018 issue of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p></div>
<div><p id="p55" data-pid="55">The lessons are currently available in English and Portuguese, with more languages to come.</p></div>
<div><p id="p56" data-pid="56">We also need to avoid such organizations as youth camps or recreational facilities that have ties to false religion. For example, regarding membership in the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association), see “<a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1979010/">Questions From Readers</a>” in the January 1, 1979, issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>The same stand must be taken toward the YWCA (Young Women’s Christian Association). Even though some local affiliates try to downplay the religious aspects of their activities, these are, in fact, organizations with religious roots and objectives.</p></div>
<div><p id="p57" data-pid="57">For a more thorough discussion of the Scriptural view of employment involving religious organizations, see “<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1999286/">Questions From Readers</a>” in the April 15, 1999, issue of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p></div>

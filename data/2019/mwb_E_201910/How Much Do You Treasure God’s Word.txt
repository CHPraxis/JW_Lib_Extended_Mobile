LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
How Much Do You Treasure God’s Word?




The Bible contains the thoughts and sayings of Jehovah God, the Author of this sacred book. (2Pe 1:20, 21) By emphasizing the vindication of God’s sovereignty by means of his Kingdom, the Bible offers to all mankind the hope that better days will soon be here. The Bible also reveals the loving personality of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.​—Ps 86:15.
Each of us values Jehovah’s Word for different reasons. But do we show that we treasure this precious gift by reading it every day and then applying it in our life? May our actions prove that we share the psalmist’s feelings: “How I do love your law!” ​—Ps 119:97.

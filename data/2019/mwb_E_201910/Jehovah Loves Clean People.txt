LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Jehovah Loves Clean People




“Wash your hands. Clean your room. Sweep the floor. Take out the trash.” Many parents teach their children how to stay clean physically. However, the principles of cleanliness originate with our holy God. (Ex 30:18-20; De 23:14; 2Co 7:1) When we keep our body and belongings clean, we honor Jehovah. (1Pe 1:14-16) What about our home and surroundings? In contrast to people who toss litter on roads and in parks, Christians do their best to keep their earthly home clean. (Ps 115:16; Re 11:18) Even small things, such as how we dispose of candy wrappers, soda cans, or chewing gum, could reveal our attitude toward cleanliness. In every aspect of life, we want to “recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”​—2Co 6:3, 4.

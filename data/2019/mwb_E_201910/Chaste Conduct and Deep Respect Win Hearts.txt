LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Chaste Conduct and Deep Respect Win Hearts




Wives who become believers often win their husbands over to the truth by their Christlike conduct. However, this may require enduring hardship for many years. (1Pe 2:21-23; 3:1, 2) If you are suffering unjustly, continue to conquer the evil with the good. (Ro 12:21) Your fine example may have a positive effect that words alone never could.
Try to look at matters from your mate’s perspective. (Php 2:3, 4) Show empathy and compassion, and do your best to fulfill your own responsibilities honorably. Be a good listener. (Jas 1:19) Be patient, and assure your mate of your love. Even if your mate never shows you the same kindness and respect, you can rest assured that Jehovah appreciates your faithfulness.​—1Pe 2:19, 20.

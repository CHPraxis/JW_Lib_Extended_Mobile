(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Pe 2:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 3:1, 2</a>) If you are suffering unjustly, continue to conquer the evil with the good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:21-45:12:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ro 12:21</a>) Your fine example may have a positive effect that words alone never could.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Try to look at matters from your mate’s perspective. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Php 2:3, 4</a>) Show empathy and compassion, and do your best to fulfill your own responsibilities honorably. Be a good listener. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas 1:19</a>) Be patient, and assure your mate of your love. Even if your mate never shows you the same kindness and respect, you can rest assured that Jehovah appreciates your faithfulness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:19-60:2:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Pe 2:19, 20</a>.</p>

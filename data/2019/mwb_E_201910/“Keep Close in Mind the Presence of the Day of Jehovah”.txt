“Keep Close in Mind the Presence of the Day of Jehovah”




3:11, 12
Jehovah will quickly execute justice at his appointed time. Do our actions show that we are ready for Jehovah’s coming day?
What does it mean to be involved “in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion”?
  We must be morally clean and stand up for our faith

  We must regularly participate in spiritual activities, both in public and in private










How can I show that I am keeping Jehovah’s day close in mind?

  “The mystery of this lawlessness” (vs. 7)​—“The lawless one” was not clearly identifiable in Paul’s day






  “The lawless one” (vs. 8)​—Today it is the clergy of Christendom as a group

  “The Lord Jesus will do away with [the lawless one] . . . by the manifestation of his presence” (vs. 8)​—Jesus will make his heavenly presence as King manifest by executing Jehovah’s judgments on Satan’s system of things, including “the lawless one”

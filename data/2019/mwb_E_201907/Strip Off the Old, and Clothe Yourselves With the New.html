<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">Did you make big changes in your personality when you came into the truth? You can be sure that Jehovah was pleased by your efforts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:11-26:33:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eze 33:11</a>) However, continuous effort is needed in order to prevent traits of the old personality from surfacing and to keep displaying the new personality. Answer the following questions to see areas where you can improve:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Am I holding a grudge against someone who has wronged me?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Do I show patience, even when I am in a hurry or tired?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  If I have an immoral thought, do I dismiss it quickly?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Do I have negative feelings about people of another race or nationality?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  Have I recently spoken unkindly to anyone or lost my temper?</p>

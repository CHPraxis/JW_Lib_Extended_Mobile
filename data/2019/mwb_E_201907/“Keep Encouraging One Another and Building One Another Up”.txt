“Keep Encouraging One Another and Building One Another Up”




5:11-14
Every Christian has the ability to encourage others. For instance, we encourage fellow Christians when we faithfully attend meetings and share in the ministry, perhaps “amid much struggling” because of poor health or other difficulties. (1Th 2:2, ftn.) Additionally, with advance thought and maybe some research, we can speak consolingly to fellow worshippers who need encouragement.
Where can you find helpful information on how to encourage someone dealing with a specific challenge?
Whom in the congregation do you want to encourage?

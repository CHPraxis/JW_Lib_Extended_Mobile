<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">As noted at the outset, many people consider the Bible to be a sacred book. They find that when they read it and apply its guidance, they feel uplifted spiritually and come to understand their purpose in life.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible uses the word “spirituality” to refer to an attitude or an approach to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:18-65:1:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jude 18, 19</a>) Unlike a fleshly-minded person, who focuses more on self, those with a spiritual outlook value God’s standards.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>HOPE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong>“If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be meager.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>WHAT IT MEANS: </strong>Discouragement can sap us of the strength we need in order to deal with life’s problems. On the other hand, hope can give us the courage to keep going. It can be comforting to acknowledge that the problems we face may well be temporary; in fact, something good may come from them.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO: </strong>Try to have an optimistic view of the future. Instead of worrying about what <strong><em>might </em></strong>happen or waiting for the perfect set of circumstances, take action in harmony with your goals. Granted, “unexpected events” can occur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>) Realistically, though, things often turn out better than we may expect. Thus, using an agricultural metaphor, the Bible says: “Sow your seed in the morning and do not let your hand rest until the evening; for you do not know which will have success, whether this one or that one, or whether they will both do well.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:6-21:11:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong>“Give me understanding . . . Your word is truth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:144-19:119:144" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:144,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:160-19:119:160" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 160</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span><strong>WHAT IT MEANS: </strong>The Bible provides answers to the questions that virtually everyone asks. For example, it answers such questions as</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  Where did we come from?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  Why are we here?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  What happens when a person dies?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">  Is this life all there is?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Millions of people around the world have improved their lives by examining the Bible’s answers to those questions and more.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO: </strong>Examine for yourself what the Bible teaches. Ask any one of Jehovah’s Witnesses for help to understand the Bible. Browse our website, jw.org, or attend one of our meetings, which are free and open to the public.</p>

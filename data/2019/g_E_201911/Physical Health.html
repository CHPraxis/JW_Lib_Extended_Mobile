<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong>“No man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:29-49:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>WHAT IT MEANS: </strong>This Bible principle encourages us to do what we can to care for our physical health. One study shows that many health problems are related to personal lifestyle choices. Hence, making the right personal choices can lead to better health.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  <strong>Nutrition. </strong>Take charge of your nutrition by eating healthful foods and drinking enough water.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  <strong>Stay Active. </strong>Physical activity can improve your health regardless of your age, even if you are disabled or limited by chronic illness. While loved ones and health practitioners can assist you with your exercise program, only you can make it work!</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  <strong>Get Enough Sleep. </strong>Prolonged sleep deprivation is associated with risks for serious illnesses. As a result of the choices they make, many people do not get enough sleep. Yet, by choosing to sleep enough, you choose to live better.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>WHAT IT MEANS: </strong>We benefit from not polluting our bodies with harmful substances such as <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>tobacco products, which are known to be a major cause of disease and death.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO: </strong>Set a date to quit, and mark it on your calendar. Just before that day, dispose of cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters, and other paraphernalia associated with this harmful habit. Avoid places where others engage in habits like this. Tell supporting friends about your decision.</p>

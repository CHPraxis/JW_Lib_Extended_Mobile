TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | REVELATION 17-19
God’s War to End All Wars




19:11, 14-16, 19-21
Why did Jehovah, “the God of love and of peace,” assign his Son, the “Prince of Peace,” to fight a war?​—2Co 13:11; Isa 9:6.
  Jehovah and Jesus love righteousness and hate wickedness

  Lasting peace and justice will come only when the wicked are removed

  God’s heavenly army “carries on war in righteousness,” as pictured by the white horses and the white, clean, fine linen


How can we assure our deliverance through this decisive conflict?​—Zep 2:3

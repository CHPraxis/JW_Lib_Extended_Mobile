In order to help people who have diverse customs and religious beliefs, we need to present the “everlasting good news” in a way that appeals to them as individuals.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Re 14:6</a>.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Choose a topic and scripture that will touch the hearts of people <em>in your territory. </em>You might select a sample conversation or pick something that you have used with success.

</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Include in your conversation greetings and customs that are common <em>in your area.​</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Co 6:3, 4</a></p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Being Adaptable




WHY IMPORTANT: The anointed and the other sheep invite people of all sorts to “take life’s water free.” (Re 22:17) This symbolic water represents all of Jehovah’s provisions for recovering obedient humans from sin and death. In order to help people who have diverse customs and religious beliefs, we need to present the “everlasting good news” in a way that appeals to them as individuals.​—Re 14:6.
HOW TO DO IT:
  Choose a topic and scripture that will touch the hearts of people in your territory. You might select a sample conversation or pick something that you have used with success. What topics and scriptures are well received? Is there a current news item on the minds of people? What would appeal to a man or a woman?

  Include in your conversation greetings and customs that are common in your area.​—2Co 6:3, 4

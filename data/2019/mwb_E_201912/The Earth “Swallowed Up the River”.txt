LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
The Earth “Swallowed Up the River”




At various times throughout history, secular authorities have helped Jehovah’s people. (Ezr 6:1-12; Es 8:10-13) Even in modern times, we have seen “the earth”​—elements of this system that are more reasonable—​swallow up “the river” of persecution instigated by “the dragon,” Satan the Devil. (Re 12:16) Jehovah, the “God who saves,” may at times move human rulers to provide relief for his people.​—Ps 68:20; Pr 21:1.
What, though, if you are imprisoned because of your faith? Never doubt that Jehovah is watching over you. (Ge 39:21-23; Ps 105:17-20) Be assured that your faith will be rewarded and that your integrity encourages your brothers worldwide.​—Php 1:12-14; Re 2:10.

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | REVELATION 7-9
An Unnumbered Great Crowd Is Blessed by Jehovah




7:9, 14-17





Why does Jehovah bless the great crowd?
  They are “standing before [Jehovah’s] throne,” giving their complete support to Jehovah’s sovereignty

  They wear “white robes,” indicating their clean, righteous standing before Jehovah because of their faith in Christ’s sacrifice

  They render “sacred service day and night,” worshipping Jehovah with consistency and earnest effort


What must I do to be part of the great crowd?

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | 2 JOHN 1-13; 3 JOHN 1-14–JUDE 1-25
We Must Fight to Stay in the Truth




Jude 3





Jesus admonished: “Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door.” (Lu 13:24) Jesus’ words imply struggling, extending ourselves in order to be approved by God. Jude, Jesus’ half brother, was inspired to write something similar: “Put up a hard fight for the faith.” Diligent effort is needed to do the following:
  Resist sexual immorality.​—Jude 6, 7

  Respect those in positions of authority.​—Jude 8, 9

  Strengthen our belief in the “most holy faith,” Christian teachings.​—Jude 20, 21

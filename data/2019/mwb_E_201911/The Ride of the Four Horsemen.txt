TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | REVELATION 4-6
The Ride of the Four Horsemen




6:2, 4-6, 8





Jesus “went out conquering” by warring with Satan and his demons in heaven and confining them to the earth. Jesus continues to conquer in behalf of his servants by helping and protecting them during these last days. He will “complete his conquest” when he terminates the ride of the other three horsemen at Armageddon and thereafter reverses the effects of their destructive ride.

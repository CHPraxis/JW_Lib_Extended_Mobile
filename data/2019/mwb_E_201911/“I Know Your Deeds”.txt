TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | REVELATION 1-3
“I Know Your Deeds”




1:20; 2:1, 2





  “The seven stars”: Anointed elders and, by extension, all elders

  “In [Jesus’] right hand”: The stars are under Jesus’ full control, power, and direction. If someone on a body of elders needs correction, Jesus will see to it that this is done in his own time and way

  “The seven golden lampstands”: Christian congregations. Just as the lampstand in the tabernacle radiated physical light, Christian congregations radiate spiritual light. (Mt 5:14) Jesus “walks among” the lampstands in that he oversees the activity of all congregations





How does this vision help you . . .
  When the elders give you direction or counsel?

  If you observe injustices or problems in your congregation?

  To share the good news at every opportunity?

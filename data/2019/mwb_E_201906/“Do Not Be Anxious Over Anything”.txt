“Do Not Be Anxious Over Anything”




4:6, 7





  Prayer is the antidote to worry

  If we pray in faith, Jehovah will give us peace that “surpasses all understanding”

  Although we may not see a way out of our problems, Jehovah can help us to endure. He may even do the unexpected.​—1Co 10:13





What are causes of anxiety in my life?
How can I show greater trust in Jehovah?

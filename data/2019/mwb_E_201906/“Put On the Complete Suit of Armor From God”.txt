“Put On the Complete Suit of Armor From God”




6:11-17
The apostle Paul compared Christians to soldiers engaged in combat. Our enemies are “wicked spirit forces.” Although we may appear weak and vulnerable, we can win the battle with Jehovah’s help if we “put on the complete suit of armor from God.”
Identify each piece of armor and what it represents





FOR MEDITATION: Is my suit of armor complete?

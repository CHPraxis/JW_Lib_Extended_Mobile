Choose Your Entertainment Wisely




Why must we choose our entertainment wisely? Because when we select a movie to watch, a song to listen to, a website to visit, a book to read, or a video game to play, we are choosing what to fill our mind with. Our choices affect our behavior. Sadly, much of the entertainment available today contains elements of things that Jehovah condemns. (Ps 11:5; Ga 5:19-21) For this reason, the Bible urges us to continue considering things that honor Jehovah.​—Php 4:8.

ACTIVE OR PASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT?
Much of today’s popular entertainment teaches a person to be passive rather than active. Movies, books, and television programs present another person’s creative ideas, not your own. While there is a place for passive entertainment, many have found active entertainment to be more rewarding. For instance, some enjoy playing a musical instrument or drawing a picture. Others enjoy outdoor recreation, such as playing sports or hiking or camping. Whatever entertainment we choose, let us “do all things for God’s glory.”​—1Co 10:31.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Make Your Personal Study More Rewarding




WHY IMPORTANT: Personal study of God’s Word helps us “to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth” of the truth. (Eph 3:18) It also helps us to remain blameless and without blemish in the midst of a wicked world and to keep “a tight grip on the word of life.” (Php 2:15, 16) Personal study of God’s Word allows us to choose material that we need as individuals. How can we make the most of the time we spend reading and studying the Bible?
HOW TO DO IT:
  Highlight verses and make notes in your personal study Bible, either on paper or in electronic format

  Ask yourself these questions as you read God’s Word: ‘Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?’

  Get the facts. Using the research tools available, search by topic or Bible verse

  Meditate on what you read to discern how the information applies to you

  Apply what you learn to your day-to-day life.​—Lu 6:47, 48

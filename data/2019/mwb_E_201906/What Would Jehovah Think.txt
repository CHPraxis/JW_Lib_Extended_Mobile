LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
What Would Jehovah Think?




Before making big or small decisions, do we ask ourselves, ‘What would Jehovah think?’ Although we will never know everything about Jehovah’s mind, he does reveal enough in his Word to equip us for “every good work.” (2Ti 3:16, 17; Ro 11:33, 34) Jesus clearly perceived Jehovah’s will and made it his priority in life. (Joh 4:34) In imitation of Jesus, may we do our best to make decisions that please Jehovah.​—Joh 8:28, 29; Eph 5:15-17.

Jehovah’s Administration and Its Work




1:8-10
Jehovah’s administration is an arrangement to unify all his intelligent creatures.
  It prepares the anointed for life in heaven with Jesus Christ as their spiritual Head

  It prepares those who will live on earth under the Messianic Kingdom


What are some ways that I can contribute to the unity of Jehovah’s organization?

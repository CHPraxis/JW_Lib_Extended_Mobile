(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) So we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Where am I looking for help and direction?’ Centuries ago, a psalmist acknowledged the need for us to raise our eyes to Jehovah for help in times of need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:123:1-19:123:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 123:1-4</a>) He compared our looking to Jehovah with the way a servant looks to his master. What did the psalmist mean by that? Well, not only does a servant look to his master for food and protection but the servant needs constantly to watch his master to discern his wishes and then to carry them out. In a similar way, we daily need to search God’s Word to ascertain what Jehovah’s will is for us personally and then to follow that direction. Only then can we be sure that Jehovah will show us favor in our time of need. <a class="xt" data-xtid="240" href="jwpub://p/E:2018483/8-9"><em>w18.07 </em>12 ¶1-2</a></p>

During the final months of his life on earth, Jesus was under intense stress. He knew that he would be executed and that he would suffer terribly.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:50-42:12:50" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 12:50</a>) And just days before his death, Jesus said: “I am troubled.” We can sense his humility and his submissiveness to God as he poured out his feelings in prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:27-43:12:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 12:27, 28</a>) When the time came, Jesus courageously handed himself over to God’s enemies, who executed him in the most agonizing and humiliating way possible.

Note, however, that in order to make our mind over to Jehovah’s way of thinking, we need to “stop being molded by this system.” We must stop taking into our minds ideas or viewpoints that are in opposition to God’s. The importance of this preliminary step can be illustrated with food. A person might seek to improve his health by eating food that is nutritious.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">We must be firmly resolved to live in harmony with the truth day by day. Wear the belt of truth around your waist. In Bible times, the belt of a soldier supported and protected his waist and his internal organs. For his belt to provide protection, however, it had to be tight. A loose belt gave little support. How does our spiritual belt of truth protect us? If we keep it wrapped tightly around us like a belt, the truth will guard us from faulty reasoning and will help us to make sound decisions. When we are tempted or under trial, Bible truth will strengthen our resolve to do what is right. Just as a soldier would never have thought of going into battle without his belt, we must be determined never to loosen or remove our belt of truth. Rather, we do all we can to keep it tight around our body by living in harmony with the truth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="250" href="jwpub://p/E:2018646/25-25"><em>w18.11 </em>12 ¶15</a></p>

As the wise writer of Proverbs notes, once we “buy,” or acquire, “truth,” we must be careful not to “sell,” or lose, it. Even something that is free may come at a cost. The Hebrew word translated “buy” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:23-20:23:23" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:23</a> can also mean “acquire.” Both words imply making an effort or exchanging something for an item of value. We might illustrate the idea of buying truth this way. Let us say that a market advertises “Free Bananas.” Will those bananas miraculously appear on our table? No. We have to make the effort to go to the market to pick them up. Are the bananas free? Yes, but we must expend the effort and take the time to go to the market. Similarly, we do not need money to buy truth. However, we must make an effort to obtain it. <a class="xt" data-xtid="249" href="jwpub://p/E:2018645/12-13"><em>w18.11 </em>4 ¶4-5</a></p>

That mental picture helps us understand what we must do to stop Satan from corrupting our thinking. In ancient times, watchmen worked closely with city gatekeepers.

In one country, a well-qualified ministerial servant was entrusted with weighty responsibilities. Although the elders in his congregation agreed that the young brother met the Scriptural qualifications of an elder to a reasonable degree, he was not recommended for appointment. A few older elders insisted that the brother looked too young to be viewed as an elder. Sadly, the brother was held back from appointment simply because of the way he looked. Reports indicate that this way of thinking affects many in various parts of the world. How important it is that we rely on the Scriptures rather than on our own viewpoints!

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Perhaps the governor feared that Jesus could cause political unrest, a principal concern throughout Pilate’s rule. Jesus answered: “My Kingdom is no part of this world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="90-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) He would not get involved in politics, for his Kingdom was to be a heavenly one. He told Pilate that his work on earth was to “bear witness to the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="91-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) When we understand our assignment as clearly as Jesus understood his, we will avoid even lending tacit, or unspoken, support for political independence movements. This may not be easy. “People in our area are becoming more and more radical,” notes one traveling overseer. “A nationalistic spirit has taken over, and many take for granted that political independence will improve their lives. Thankfully, the brothers have safeguarded their Christian unity by concentrating on preaching the good news of the Kingdom. They look to God to solve injustice and the other problems we face.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="237" href="jwpub://p/E:2018441/14-15"><em>w18.06 </em>4-5 ¶6-7</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Only three books of the Hebrew Scriptures, 1 Chronicles, Job, and Zechariah, mention Satan, which means “Resister.” Why was little said about our enemy prior to the arrival of the Messiah? Apparently, Jehovah did not want to give Satan undue prominence by devoting large portions of the Hebrew Scriptures to discussing him and his activity. Jehovah’s primary purpose for inspiring that section of the Scriptures was to identify the Messiah and lead God’s people to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Luke 24:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:24-48:3:24" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> Gal. 3:24</a>) When that was accomplished and the Messiah arrived, Jehovah used him and his disciples to reveal much of what we know about Satan and the angels who joined him. That is fitting, since it is Jesus and his anointed corulers whom Jehovah will use to crush Satan and his followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Rom. 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:14-66:17:14" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> Rev. 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="94-3" class="b"> 20:10</a>) Remember, the Devil’s power is limited.

Politicians have used lies to mislead mankind. One of the biggest lies is yet to be heard when men proclaim that they have achieved “peace and security!” But “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.” May we not be taken in by their attempt to minimize how precarious this system of things really is!

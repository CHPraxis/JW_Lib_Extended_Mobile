One way we can praise him is by making heartfelt comments at our meetings. We can show the depth of our love for Jehovah and his Son by being willing to make sacrifices for them. Often, we must make sacrifices of various kinds to attend our meetings. Many congregations hold one meeting at the end of a workday when we are most likely tired. And another meeting is held on the weekend when other people are resting. Does Jehovah notice that we attend our meetings even though we are tired? Certainly he does! In fact, the greater our struggle, the more Jehovah appreciates the love we show for him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:41-41:12:44" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 12:41-44</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="296" href="jwpub://p/E:2019246/20-21"><em>w19.01 </em>29 ¶12-13</a></p>

Consider an example of the beautiful word picture Isaiah uses to illustrate how Jehovah protects us. He refers to Jehovah as a shepherd and to God’s servants as lambs. Isaiah says of Jehovah: “With his arm he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:11-23:40:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Isa. 40:11</a>) When we sense Jehovah’s strong arms wrapped around us, we feel protected and calm.

Let your facial expressions reflect your sincere, loving concern. If the other Christian feels the need to explain things in greater detail, be patient and resist any urge to interrupt. By listening patiently, you will more likely understand the feelings involved.

It helps us keep a balanced view of secular authorities and motivates us in our witnessing work. We understand that Jehovah wants us to respect governmental authorities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="99-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>) And he expects us to obey the laws of human governments as long as those laws do not conflict with his standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:4" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1-4</a>) But we realize that we must remain neutral, never favoring one political party or human leader over another.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">In the event of marital problems, is separation a justifiable solution? The Scriptures do not outline various grounds for separation. Paul wrote: “If a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is agreeable to staying with her, let her not leave her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:13" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:12, 13</a>) That applies in our day too. Admittedly, there have been instances where an “unbelieving husband” seems to prove that he is not “agreeable to staying with her.” He might be extremely physically abusive, even to the point that she feels that her health or life is in danger. He might refuse to support her and the family or severely endanger her spirituality. In such cases, some Christians have personally decided that, despite what he might say, the mate is not “agreeable to staying” together and that a separation is necessary. But other Christians in comparably difficult situations have not; they have endured and tried to work at improving matters. <a class="xt" data-xtid="290" href="jwpub://p/E:2018683/24-24"><em>w18.12 </em>13 ¶14,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="291" href="jwpub://p/E:2018683/26-26"> 16;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="292" href="jwpub://p/E:2018683/27-27"> 14 ¶17</a></p>

The soil represents man’s figurative heart. The seed that fell on the fine soil took root, sprouted, and “produced 100 times more fruit.” Just as the fine soil in Jesus’ illustration retained the seed, we accepted the message and held on to it. As a result, the seedlike Kingdom message took root and grew, as it were, into a wheat stalk that, in time, was ready to bear fruit. And just as a wheat stalk produces as fruit, not new stalks, but new seed, we are producing as fruit, not new disciples, but new Kingdom seed. How do we produce new Kingdom seed? Each time we in one way or another proclaim the Kingdom message, we duplicate and scatter, so to speak, the seed that was planted in our heart.

An outstanding example in this respect was given by Jesus himself after his death and resurrection. He had some firm counsel to give to certain congregations in Asia Minor, but notice how he went about it. Before giving them counsel, he gave warm commendation to the congregations in Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira.

You will find this very upbuilding, and both you and they will be even more motivated to let the light of truth shine. And all of us can make it a point to welcome those who attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall. If you are assigned to handle a meeting for field service, you can do much to help older ones to have a share in the ministry. Do they have suitable territory? In some cases, you may choose to assign them to work with a younger companion who can provide physical support. You can also show understanding to those whose health and circumstances limit what they can do. Yes, your consideration and discernment can help young and old, experienced and less experienced, to preach the good news with zeal.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:32-3:19:32" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Lev. 19:32</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="272" href="jwpub://p/E:2018447/19-21"><em>w18.06 </em>23-24 ¶10-12</a></p>

The apostle Peter warned against using our freedom as an excuse for catering to our fleshly desires. Does that warning not remind you of what befell the Israelites in the wilderness? And the danger is still with us, perhaps even more so. Satan and his world offer ever more alluring choices in dress and grooming, food and drink, recreation and entertainment, and a host of other things. Clever advertisers often feature attractive people deceptively promoting as must-haves many things we really do not need.

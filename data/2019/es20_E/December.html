<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Someone might ask, ‘Is there ever a basis for a Christian to divorce and remarry?’ Well, Jesus stated his view on divorce: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:11-41:10:12" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Mark 10:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:18-42:16:18" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Luke 16:18</a>) Clearly, Jesus thus honored marriage and wanted others to do so. A man divorcing his faithful wife (or a woman, her faithful husband) on some pretext and marrying another was committing adultery. This is true because merely divorcing one’s mate does not end the marriage. In God’s eyes, the two would still be “one flesh.” Moreover, Jesus said that a man’s divorcing his innocent wife would make her subject to adultery. How so? Back then, a divorced woman might feel compelled to remarry in order to gain financial support. Such a remarriage would amount to adultery. <a class="xt" data-xtid="427" href="jwpub://p/E:2018683/16-18"><em>w18.12 </em>11 ¶8-9</a></p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">What makes integrity so vital that each of us needs it? You need integrity because Satan has challenged Jehovah, and he has challenged you. That rebellious angel smeared Jehovah’s good name by implying that God is a bad, selfish, and dishonest Ruler. Sadly, Adam and Eve sided with Satan, rebelling against Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-6</a>) Life in Eden had given them countless opportunities to strengthen their love for Jehovah. But at the time of Satan’s challenge, their love was not complete, sound, or whole. Another question arose: Would any humans remain loyal to Jehovah God out of love for him? In other words, are humans capable of showing integrity? That question came to the fore in the case of Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:11" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Job 1:8-11</a>) Like us, the man was imperfect. He made mistakes.

Was Moses thinking mainly of his own feelings instead of how he could glorify Jehovah? If such a faithful prophet as Moses could be distracted and stumbled, the same thing could easily happen to us. Like Moses, we are about to enter a symbolic land, the new world that Jehovah has promised us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="93-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>) None of us want to miss out on that special privilege. To fulfill our goal, though, we need to keep our eyes fixed on Jehovah, always seeking to do his will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="414" href="jwpub://p/E:2018483/24-26"><em>w18.07 </em>15 ¶14-16</a></p>

For example, nowhere do the Scriptures indicate that they can read the mind or heart of an individual. Only Jehovah and Jesus are spoken of as having that ability.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Suppose you plan to travel to a distant town for an important event. Getting there requires a long journey by bus. At the bus station, there are many buses. You need to board the bus that is going to your chosen destination! Boarding a bus going anywhere else would mean that you would head in the wrong direction. Adolescents today face a similar situation: a long journey, not by bus, but in life. At times they may feel overwhelmed by the opportunities and decisions that confront them. Youths, you can make it easier for yourselves if you have a good idea where you want to go in life. Will you focus your life on your desire to please Jehovah? That means including him in all aspects of life​—education, employment, family responsibilities, and so on. And it means reaching out for spiritual goals. Young people who keep focused on serving Jehovah can be sure of his blessing in making a success of life. <a class="xt" data-xtid="409" href="jwpub://p/E:2018368/8-10"><em>w18.04 </em>25 ¶1-3</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">A significant number of angels joined Satan’s rebellion. Prior to the Flood, Satan lured at least some of them into having immoral relations with the daughters of men. The Bible reveals this truth by symbolically portraying the dragon as dragging a third of the stars of heaven with him in his fall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:4" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:3-66:12:4" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:3, 4</a>) When those angels abandoned God’s family, they put themselves under Satan’s control. These rebels, however, are not just a mob of troublemakers. Satan has set up an imitation of God’s Kingdom, with himself as king. In the invisible realm, Satan has organized the demons into governments, given them authority, and made them world rulers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) By means of his spirit organization, Satan exerts authority over all human governments. <a class="xt" data-xtid="410" href="jwpub://p/E:2018406/13-14"><em>w18.05 </em>23 ¶5-6</a></p>

He meditated on God’s thoughts, making them his own and allowing them to mold him. When you in faith do the same, you too will grow in love for God and in your desire to obey him. You will also gain spiritual maturity and depth. A sister named Christin said, “When I do research and meditate on what I read, I get the feeling that Jehovah had this penned just for me!” It is no exaggeration to say that a spiritual outlook on life also gives you exceptional knowledge and insight by enabling you to see the world and its future through God’s eyes. Why does God give you such knowledge and insight? He wants you to set sound priorities in your life, to make wise decisions, and to look forward to the future with confidence!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:3-23:26:3" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Isa. 26:3</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="429" href="jwpub://p/E:2018688/18-19"><em>w18.12 </em>26 ¶9-10</a></p>

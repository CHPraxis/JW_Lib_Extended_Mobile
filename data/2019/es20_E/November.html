Adam and Eve chose not to serve Jehovah because they failed to develop a strong love for him. Even so, Jehovah allowed them to live long enough to have children and to set their own standards for raising those children. The results of Adam and Eve’s decision to be independent of Jehovah soon made it clear how foolish they had been. Their oldest son murdered his innocent brother, and in time violence and selfishness dominated the human family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:8-1:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6:11-13</a>) All the while, Jehovah had a means to save all of Adam and Eve’s children who want to serve him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:1-45:16:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rom. 16:1-15</a>) Paul was aware that his brothers and sisters were imperfect, but he chose to focus on their good qualities.

Why? Stressful events​—such as when a loved one dies or is disfellowshipped or when faced with a divorce or the loss of a job—​can rob us of happiness. Domestic strife and a breakdown in peaceful communication can erode our sense of well-being. Ridicule by workmates or classmates, religious persecution, or imprisonment can undermine our happiness. So can deteriorating health, chronic illness, or depression. Nevertheless, Jesus Christ, “the happy and only Potentate,” delighted in bringing comfort and happiness to people.

What did newly converted Christians in Ephesus who had been practicing magical arts do in order to put away those unscriptural practices and buy truth?

At times, this may require learning the languages and customs of those whom society in general has marginalized. In no way should Witnesses who reach out to such ones view themselves as superior.

Granted, many people do not listen to us, but they do observe us. They notice our neat attire, polite behavior, and warm smile. In time, our conduct may help some to see that their negative views about us may not be correct after all. Sergio and Olinda, pioneers, relate: “Because of illness, we did not go to the square for a while. When we returned, passersby asked, ‘What happened? We missed you.’” Indeed, as long as we “do not let [our] hand rest” from sowing Kingdom seed, we have a valuable share in giving “a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Above all, we have the deep joy that comes from knowing that we have Jehovah’s approval, for he loves all those who “bear fruit with endurance”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:15-42:8:15" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Luke 8:15</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="375" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/27-29"><em>w18.05 </em>16 ¶16-18</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Jas. 1:19</a>) We all can be encouraging to a brother or a sister who is in need of comfort.

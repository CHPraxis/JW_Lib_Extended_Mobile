<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What about us? Do we think God’s thoughts or those of this world? Granted, we have likely conformed our conduct to God’s requirements. But what about our thinking? Are we bringing our thoughts and viewpoints into alignment with Jehovah’s? Doing so requires a deliberate effort. On the other hand, little or no effort is needed to absorb the world’s thinking. That is because the spirit of the world is all around us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>) Furthermore, because it often appeals to self-interest, the world’s way of thinking can be enticing. Yes, it is challenging to think like Jehovah but all too easy to think like the world. However, if we allow the world to mold our thinking, we will be inclined toward selfishness and a desire for moral independence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:21-41:7:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 7:21, 22</a>) It is therefore vital that we cultivate “God’s thoughts,” not “those of men.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="137" href="jwpub://p/E:2018642/8-8"><em>w18.11 </em>18 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:2018642/10-11"> 19 ¶3-4</a></p>

At the same time, Jesus prepared his followers for what they would soon face. Jesus also showed courage by setting aside any anxiety he may have had and by focusing attention on the needs of his faithful apostles.

He told them to their face: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you travel over sea and dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him a subject for Gehenna [everlasting destruction] twice as much so as yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:15-40:23:15" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matt. 23:15</a>; ftn.) Jesus condemned those false religious leaders in the strongest terms.

He went on to say: “Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:12-40:5:12" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 5:12</a>) When the apostles were beaten and commanded to stop preaching, “they went out from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing.” Of course, they did not relish the pain of being whipped. Yet, they rejoiced “because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus’] name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:41-44:5:41" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Acts 5:41</a>) In our time, Jehovah’s people also endure with joy when they suffer in behalf of Jesus’ name or when they face difficult trials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:4" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2-4</a>) Like the apostles, we do not take delight in any kind of suffering. But if we maintain our integrity to God during trials, Jehovah can help us to endure with fortitude. When we have the smile of approval of “the happy God,” we can be happy despite religious persecution or opposition at home.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="131" href="jwpub://p/E:2018567/29-31"><em>w18.09 </em>21 ¶18-20</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="106-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) Estimates suggest that more than 800,000 people die every year from suicide​—about one death every 40 seconds. Sad to say, even some Christians have succumbed to such pressures and have taken their own life. Even if our brothers and sisters do not necessarily feel like giving up, many today deal with stressful situations and need to be built up in love. Some endure persecution and ridicule. Others are the victims of criticism or backbiting at their workplace. Or they are exhausted because of working overtime or having to meet relentless deadlines. Still others deal with strength-sapping domestic problems, perhaps being the target of criticism by an unbelieving mate. As a result of these and other pressures, many in the congregation feel physically and emotionally drained. <a class="xt" data-xtid="128" href="jwpub://p/E:2018566/11-11"><em>w18.09 </em>13 ¶3,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="129" href="jwpub://p/E:2018566/13-13"> 5</a></p>

Many who have done so have later seen their sons and daughters take up full-time service assignments far from home. Some are missionaries; others pioneer where the need for publishers is greater; still others serve at Bethel. Distance might mean that families cannot get together as often as they would like to. Nevertheless, the self-sacrificing parents encourage their children to persevere in their assignments. Why? They find great joy and satisfaction in knowing that their children are putting Kingdom interests first. Perhaps many of these parents feel like Hannah, who said that she “lent” her son Samuel to Jehovah. These parents rightly view such cooperation as a precious privilege. They would not want things any other way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:28-9:1:28" data-bid="108-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:28</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="126" href="jwpub://p/E:2018522/12-12"><em>w18.08 </em>24 ¶4</a></p>

Many poor people did not respond. The point is, We simply cannot judge a person’s relationship with Jehovah by his material possessions. We are blessed to have many brothers and sisters, rich and poor, who love and serve Jehovah with a complete heart. The Scriptures instruct those who are rich “to place their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:17-54:6:19" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:17-19</a>) At the same time, God’s Word admonishes all of God’s people, rich and poor, to be careful not to love money.

Perhaps they have in mind Paul’s words to the Corinthian Christians about food: “Why should my freedom be judged by another person’s conscience?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:29-46:10:29" data-bid="121-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:29</a>) While it is true that we have the freedom to make these personal choices, we need to remember that our freedom is relative and that all decisions we make have consequences. For that reason, Paul prefaced his statement with the words of today’s text. That certainly helps us to see that there are far more important factors to consider than our own preferences when it comes to exercising personal freedom in all aspects of our life. <a class="xt" data-xtid="119" href="jwpub://p/E:2018362/18-18"><em>w18.04 </em>10 ¶10</a></p>

The first couple’s life was completely free from worries about food, work, sickness, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 15</a>) When it comes to freedom, though, a key point for us to bear in mind is that Jehovah God alone has what can be called absolute and unlimited freedom. Why? Because he is the Creator of all things and the almighty Sovereign of the universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 4:11</a>) Accordingly, all creatures in heaven and on earth have freedom in only a relative sense. They must recognize that Jehovah God has the ultimate authority to impose what he determines to be just, necessary, and reasonable limits. That, in fact, was what Jehovah God did with his human creation right from the beginning. <a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:2018361/12-12"><em>w18.04 </em>4 ¶4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="77" href="jwpub://p/E:2018361/14-14"> 6</a></p>

Like Jesus, we feel pity for them, and we are moved to bring them “good news of something better.” So be patient with those whom you teach. Remember, they may never have considered some of the Bible truths we know very well. And many have a strong emotional connection to their current beliefs. They may see their religious views as uniting them with their family, their culture, and their community. Before we ask people to give up their cherished “old” beliefs, we may first need to help them build a strong appreciation for “new” truths​—Bible teachings that at the outset are unfamiliar to them. Only then will they be ready to abandon their former viewpoint.

We were happy to make material sacrifices in order to walk in the truth. Over time, however, we may see others buying the latest electronic devices or enjoying other material advantages. We could begin to feel that we are losing out. No longer content with the necessities, we might put spiritual pursuits aside in favor of accumulating material possessions. Such a course reminds us of Demas. His love for “the present system of things” led him to abandon a life of service with the apostle Paul. Why did Demas leave Paul? Whether he loved material things more than spiritual activities or he was no longer willing to make personal sacrifices in order to serve with Paul, the Bible does not say. We surely do not want to rekindle a desire for material things and let those attractions crowd out our love for the truth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:2018646/18-18"><em>w18.11 </em>10 ¶9</a></p>

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Despite Moses’ long record of unselfish leadership, the people complained not only about the lack of water but also about Moses, as if it were his fault that they were thirsty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:1-4:20:5" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Num. 20:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:9-4:20:11" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>) In the heat of anger, Moses lost his mild disposition. Rather than speak in faith to the rock, as Jehovah had commanded, Moses spoke in bitterness to the people and gave credit to himself. Then, he struck the rock twice and much water gushed out. Pride and anger caused him to make a painful mistake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:32-19:106:33" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Ps. 106:32, 33</a>) For his temporary lack of meekness, Moses was not allowed to enter the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:12-4:20:12" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Num. 20:12</a>) From this incident, we learn valuable lessons. First, we must constantly work at maintaining our meek attitude. If we neglect it for a moment, pride may reassert itself and cause us to speak and act foolishly. Second, stress can weaken us, so we must strive to be meek, even when we are under pressure. <a class="xt" data-xtid="109" href="jwpub://p/E:2019282/27-29"><em>w19.02 </em>12-13 ¶19-21</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">A young person who focuses his life on the desire to please Jehovah gives special attention to the ministry. Because the preaching work is so urgent, it should be high on our list of priorities. Could you set the goal of sharing in the ministry more often? Could you pioneer? But what if you find little joy in preaching? And how can you be more effective at giving a witness? Two basic steps will help: Prepare well, and do not give up sharing what you know with others. It might surprise you how much joy you will then find when preaching. You could start by working out an answer to a question commonly raised by schoolmates, such as “Why do you believe in God?” Our jw.org website contains articles designed to help young people work out for themselves how to answer that question. There you will find a worksheet entitled “<a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014157&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">Why Do I Believe in God?</a>” The worksheet will guide you in preparing your own answer. <a class="xt" data-xtid="81" href="jwpub://p/E:2018368/19-20"><em>w18.04 </em>27 ¶10-11</a></p>

Some of them were instinctive, but they were limits nonetheless. For example, our first parents knew that to keep on living, they had to breathe, eat, sleep, and so on. Would they feel a loss of freedom for having to do these things? No, for Jehovah saw to it that even in doing such routine things, they could find enjoyment and contentment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:14-19:104:15" data-bid="115-1" class="b">Ps. 104:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:12-21:3:13" data-bid="115-2" class="b"> Eccl. 3:12, 13</a>) Jehovah specifically commanded Adam and Eve to populate the earth and to take care of it.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">If we are patient with people in the ministry, we will not expect them to understand or accept Bible truth the first time they hear it. As an example, consider how we might reason with someone about the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth. Many believe that death is the end of it all or that all good people go to heaven. One brother relates an approach that he finds effective. First, he reads <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>. Then, he asks the householder where and in what conditions God wanted the human family to live. Most people answer, “On earth, in good conditions.” Next, the brother reads <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a> and asks whether God’s purpose has changed. Often, the householder will answer no. Finally, the brother reads <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a> and asks what mankind’s future will be like. Using this Scriptural reasoning, he has helped a number of people to understand that God still wants good people to live forever in Paradise on earth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="114" href="jwpub://p/E:2019321/21-22"><em>w19.03 </em>24 ¶14-15;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="115" href="jwpub://p/E:2019321/27-27"> 25 ¶19</a></p>

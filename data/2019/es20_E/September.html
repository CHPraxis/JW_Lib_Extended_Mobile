We benefit greatly from learning about Jesus’ fellow feeling. Of course, we are not perfect as he was. Yet, we love him for the way he treated others. We are encouraged to know that he is now ruling as King of God’s Kingdom. He will soon eliminate all suffering. He is in the best position to help humanity recover from the wounds inflicted by Satan’s rulership, for Jesus too was once human.

Is that your view of marriage in general and particularly of your own marriage if you have a mate? In honoring marriage, you are in the best of company. Jesus honored marriage. When the Pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, he referred to what God had said regarding the first marriage: “For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother, and the two will be one flesh.” Jesus added: “What God has yoked together, let no man put apart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:2-41:10:12" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Mark 10:2-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Gen. 2:24</a>) Jesus thus agreed that marriage is of divine origin and stressed its permanence.

While learning to think like Jehovah is a delight, it can also be a challenge. At times, our imperfect reasoning might get in the way. For example, we might have difficulty understanding Jehovah’s view of moral cleanness, materialism, the preaching work, the misuse of blood, or something else. What can we do? How can we continue to make progress in making God’s thoughts our own? The answer lies in making our mind over by studying God’s Word with a view to grasping his thoughts, meditating on them, and bringing our thinking into alignment with God’s thinking. <a class="xt" data-xtid="324" href="jwpub://p/E:2018643/9-12"><em>w18.11 </em>23-24 ¶2-4</a></p>

That is where our Bible-trained conscience comes into play. Jehovah has lovingly given us principles that work in conjunction with our Bible-trained conscience. He himself says: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One guiding you in the way you should walk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17, 18</a>) By using our mind and heart to reason on Bible principles, we correct, direct, and mold our conscience.

Yet, many allowed bad desires to take root and grow. Similarly, we may have served for decades in the earthly part of God’s organization. Yet, even in this spiritually clean environment, unclean desires can take root. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="88-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:12</a>) How important it is that we constantly search our heart, reject immoral thoughts, and suppress unhealthy pride!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Gal. 5:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> Col. 3:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="308" href="jwpub://p/E:2018406/20-21"><em>w18.05 </em>25 ¶11-12</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Paul felt discouraged by the Jews’ negative reaction to the Kingdom message. Even so, he did not give up on them. Note what he further said in his letter to the Christians in Rome about his feelings toward those Jews: “The goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are indeed for their salvation. For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to accurate knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:1-45:10:2" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Rom. 10:1, 2</a>) Paul stated why he kept on preaching to the Jews. He was moved by <em>“the goodwill of [his] heart.” </em>It was his heart’s desire that some Jews would find salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:13-45:11:14" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Rom. 11:13, 14</a>) He implored God in prayer to help individual Jews to accept the Kingdom message. Paul added: <em>“They have a zeal for God.” </em>He saw a potential for good in people. Zeal, if properly directed, can transform sincere individuals into zealous disciples of Christ, as Paul well knew. <a class="xt" data-xtid="305" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/12-12"><em>w18.05 </em>13 ¶4;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="306" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/23-24"> 15-16 ¶13-14</a></p>

Paul gave this advice: “If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship, if any tender affection and compassion, make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind. Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you, as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:4" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Phil. 2:1-4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="303" href="jwpub://p/E:2018367/20-20"><em>w18.04 </em>22 ¶10;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="304" href="jwpub://p/E:2018367/22-22"> 23 ¶12</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Gal. 5:16</a>) Consider, for example, the patriarch Noah and his family. They lived in a violent and immoral world. Yet, they kept free from being entangled in the desires and pursuits of the people around them. How did they manage to do that? They chose to keep busy in all that Jehovah had assigned them to do​—build the ark, store up food for themselves and the animals, and sound the warning to others. “Noah did according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:22-1:6:22" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Gen. 6:22</a>) The result?

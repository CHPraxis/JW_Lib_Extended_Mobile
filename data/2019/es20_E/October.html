<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When applied to us as servants of God, integrity means wholehearted love for and unbreakable devotion to Jehovah as a Person, so that his will comes first in all our decisions. One basic meaning of the Bible word for “integrity” is this: complete, sound, or whole. For example, the animals sacrificed to Jehovah had to be sound. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:21-3:22:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Lev. 22:21, 22</a>) God’s people were not allowed to offer up an animal that was missing a leg, an ear, or an eye; nor could they offer one full of disease. It was important to Jehovah that the animal be complete, sound, or whole. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mal. 1:6-9</a>) We can understand why Jehovah cares about soundness or completeness. When we purchase something, whether a piece of fruit, a book, or a tool, we do not want one that has gaping holes or parts missing. We want one that is complete, sound, or whole. Jehovah feels similarly when it comes to our love for him, our loyalty. It must be complete, sound, or whole. <a class="xt" data-xtid="368" href="jwpub://p/E:2019281/9-9"><em>w19.02 </em>3 ¶3</a></p>

If the gates were never open, the inhabitants of the city would starve. Similarly, we need to open our heart regularly to the influence of God’s thinking. The Bible contains Jehovah’s thinking, so each time we read it, we allow Jehovah’s thoughts to affect the way we think, feel, and act. How can we get the most from our Bible reading? Prayer is vital to help us “see clearly the wonderful things” in his Word.

Think of the type of sacrifices that he accepted from the Israelites. Some Israelites were able to offer a lamb or a goat. But a poor Israelite might offer “two turtledoves or two young pigeons.” And if an Israelite could not afford two birds, Jehovah accepted “a tenth of an ephah of fine flour.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:7-3:5:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Lev. 5:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:11-3:5:11" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Flour was less expensive, but Jehovah still appreciated that sacrifice, as long as it was “fine flour.” Our kind God feels the same way today.

It could well be that Habakkuk was the first to whom Jehovah revealed that the end of that violent era was very near. Jehovah showed Habakkuk that He was ready to act. The punishment of that violent and wicked generation was imminent.

When we study, we consider what the material tells us about Jehovah, his ways, and his thinking. We try to understand <em>why </em>God commands one thing and condemns another. We also give thought to what changes we need to make in our life and in our thinking.

Many who have had the privilege of conducting progressive Bible studies will tell you that few things are more rewarding. Great happiness comes from seeing appreciative individuals light up when they grasp spiritual truths, grow in faith, make changes, and start sharing the truth with others.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">How can we imitate Paul? First, we strive to maintain a heartfelt desire to find any who might be “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” Second, we supplicate Jehovah in prayer to open the heart of sincere ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Acts 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> 16:14</a>) Silvana, a pioneer for nearly 30 years, says, “Before I go to a house in my territory, I pray to Jehovah, asking him to give me a positive attitude.” We also pray to God that angels may direct us to find honesthearted ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:13" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:6</a>) Notes Robert, a pioneer for over 30 years, “To work along with angels who know what is going on in the householders’ lives is exciting.” Third, we try to see a potential for good in people. Says Carl, an elder, “I look for any small sign that may reveal a person’s sincerity, perhaps a smile, a kind look, or an honest question.” Yes, like Paul, we can endure in bearing fruit. <a class="xt" data-xtid="339" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/23-23"><em>w18.05 </em>15 ¶13;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="340" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/25-25"> 16 ¶15</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">News of faithfulness on the part of those we have helped in the past can be a real source of encouragement, as it was for the apostle John, who wrote: “No greater joy do I have than this: that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="97-1" class="b">3 John 4</a>) Many pioneers can attest to how encouraging it is for them to learn that some of those they helped into the truth years ago are staying faithful and perhaps are even serving as pioneers. Simply reminding a discouraged pioneer of past joys can be a real source of comfort. Many circuit overseers have stated how encouraged they and their wives felt after receiving even a short note of gratitude for their visit to a congregation. The same can be true of elders, missionaries, pioneers, and Bethel family members who receive a word of appreciation for their faithful service. <a class="xt" data-xtid="338" href="jwpub://p/E:2018367/25-26"><em>w18.04 </em>23 ¶14-15</a></p>

Solomon built an altar to the idol goddess Ashtoreth and at least one other altar to the false god Chemosh. There he joined his wives in pagan worship. He built those altars on, of all places, a mountain located directly in front of Jerusalem, where he had built Jehovah’s temple!

Nineteen-year-old Ida struggles with feelings of unworthiness. She says, “I have often felt that Jehovah isn’t close to me and that he doesn’t want to be my Friend.” How does she deal with this attack? “The meetings are a giant boost to my faith,” says Ida. “I used to sit there and never comment, thinking that nobody would want to hear what I had to say. Now, though, I prepare for the meetings and try to answer two or three times.” Ida’s experience highlights an important truth: The literal shield given to a soldier had fixed dimensions, but the size of our shield of faith can either shrink or grow. It is up to us.

Perhaps they may have lost their longtime job unexpectedly and are left in shock. Others may be at a loss after being diagnosed with a serious illness, or they may be heartbroken after losing a loved one in death. They may ask questions about the meaning of life that at one time they ignored. Perhaps they even wonder, ‘What must I do to get saved?’ When we meet them, they may want to listen to our message of hope for the first time in their life.

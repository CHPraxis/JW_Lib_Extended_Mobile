In saying so, they are confusing the exercise of one’s free will with the right to <em>decide </em>what is good and what is bad. Adam and Eve did have the freedom to choose whether they would obey God or not. However, only Jehovah has the right to decide in the absolute sense what is good and what is bad, as symbolized by “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad” in the garden of Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:9-1:2:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 2:9</a>) By means of his command, Jehovah lovingly taught Adam and Eve the way to exercise true freedom.

In striving for self-determination, they lost the true freedom they had been given. <a class="xt" data-xtid="196" href="jwpub://p/E:2018361/18-21"><em>w18.04 </em>5-6 ¶9-12</a></p>

Jehovah said to Moses: “I have certainly seen the affliction of my people . . . , and I have heard their outcry . . . I well know the pains they suffer.

Centuries later, in the Promised Land, the Israelites faced enemy attacks. How did Jehovah respond? He “was moved to pity over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them and those who were treating them abusively.” Again, empathy moved Jehovah to help his people.

Young and old would be safe.

Their land would produce abundant fruit, made possible by an ample supply of water, even as the garden of Eden was well-watered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:10-1:2:14" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Gen. 2:10-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:12-24:31:12" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:12</a>) Would that be the only fulfillment? There is no evidence that those returning from exile were miraculously cured. For example, the blind did not regain their sight.

How can we strengthen our determination to go on walking in the truth? Continue to study the precious truths of God’s Word and meditate on them. Yes, buy truth by regularly setting aside time to feed on the precious truths of God’s Word. You will thus deepen your appreciation for the truth and strengthen your resolve never to sell it. In addition to buying truth, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:23-20:23:23" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:23</a> says that we should also buy “wisdom and discipline and understanding.” Knowledge alone is not enough.

At times, the truth disciplines us, showing us where we need to make changes. May we always be responsive to such guidance.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">The sword used by Roman infantrymen at the time Paul wrote his letter was about 20 inches (50 cm) long and was designed for hand-to-hand combat. One reason that Roman soldiers were so effective is that they practiced with their weapons every day. Paul likens God’s Word to a sword that Jehovah has given us. But we must learn to use it skillfully when defending our beliefs​—or when adjusting our own thinking.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) In his wisdom, Jehovah has never told us the personal name of the angelic son who rebelled against him.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">If you have ever felt discouraged when preaching in less responsive territories, you will relate to the apostle Paul. During his approximately 30-year-long ministry, he helped numerous individuals to become disciples of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:21" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Acts 14:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:2-47:3:3" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 3:2, 3</a>) Still, he did not succeed in moving many Jews to become true worshippers. On the contrary, most rebuffed Paul, and some even persecuted him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:19" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Acts 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:1-44:17:1" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> 17:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:4-44:17:5" data-bid="107-3" class="b"> 4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:13-44:17:13" data-bid="107-4" class="b"> 13</a>) How did that adverse reaction from the Jews affect Paul? He freely admitted: “I am telling the truth in Christ . . . I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:3" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Rom. 9:1-3</a>) Why did Paul experience such feelings? His heart was in the preaching work. He preached to the Jews out of deep concern for them. So it pained Paul to see them reject God’s mercy. Like Paul, we preach to people out of heartfelt concern.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Matt. 22:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:1</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="200" href="jwpub://p/E:2018403/12-13"><em>w18.05 </em>13 ¶4-5</a></p>

Brothers and sisters who remain single because they want to obey the admonition to marry “only in the Lord” make up another group that merits encouragement.

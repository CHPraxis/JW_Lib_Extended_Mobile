In fact, he had been so quick-tempered that he killed a man who he judged was acting unfairly. Moses assumed that Jehovah would agree with his actions. Jehovah spent 40 years helping Moses to understand that he needed more than courage to lead the Israelites; he needed to be meek. And to be meek, he also needed to be humble, submissive, and mild. He learned that lesson well and became an excellent overseer.

He observed that the people “were as sheep without a shepherd.” Maybe Jesus saw that some of them were poor and were working long hours to provide for their families. Perhaps others were dealing with the loss of a loved one. If so, Jesus could likely relate to their situation. He may have faced some of these problems himself. Jesus was concerned about others, and he felt moved to bring them a message of comfort.

There, Jesus said something that startled them: “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.” Instead of asking Jesus to explain, they were stumbled by his words and said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?” As a result, “many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:53-43:6:66" data-bid="41-1" class="b">John 6:53-66</a>) Sadly, some today have failed to hold on to the truth. Some were stumbled by what a prominent brother said or did. Others were offended by Scriptural counsel they received, or they let go of the truth because of a personality clash with a fellow Christian. <a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:2018646/10-13"><em>w18.11 </em>9 ¶3-5</a></p>

Even so, our enemies are real. Satan and the demons are skilled warriors with vast experience. At first glance, our prospects may seem bleak. Young Christians in particular may appear to be vulnerable. How can they hope to win against superhuman, wicked spirit forces? The fact is, young ones can win, and they are winning! Why? Because they “go on acquiring power in the Lord.” But they do more than draw on God’s power. They are dressed for battle. Like well-trained soldiers, they have “put on the complete suit of armor from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:12" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Eph. 6:10-12</a>) When developing his illustration, Paul perhaps had in mind the armor worn by Roman legionnaires.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:16" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Acts 28:16</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:2018407/8-9"><em>w18.05 </em>27 ¶1-2</a></p>

For instance, by proclaiming the truth about Jehovah’s wonderful qualities and his unchangeable purpose for mankind, we defend God’s name against Satan’s lies and slander.

As a young person, think of all you owe to Jehovah. Your life, your faith, the Bible, the congregation, and your wonderful hope for the future. Giving priority to spiritual matters is a way of showing gratitude to God for these blessings, and that brings you closer to him. Once you start working toward spiritual goals, you begin building a record of good works in Jehovah’s eyes. This brings you even closer to him. The apostle Paul promised: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) You are never too young to set goals.

Yet, much of the power and glory of the Roman Empire was built on the backs of slaves. At one point, some 30 percent of the population were slaves. Undoubtedly, slavery and freedom were topics on the minds of the common people, including Christians. The letters of the apostle Paul have much to say about freedom. However, the objective of his ministry was not social or political reform, the very thing people of that day were seeking. Rather than looking to any human ruler or agency for freedom, Paul and his fellow Christians worked hard to help others learn the good news of God’s Kingdom and the incomparable value of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus. Paul directed his fellow believers to the Source of true freedom. <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:2018362/8-9"><em>w18.04 </em>8 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">To be able to do what one wants to do or to live the way one wants to live seems to be much desired by people everywhere. How to satisfy those desires, however, is quite another matter. On the social or political level, many resort to protests, demonstrations, revolts, even revolutions. But do such confrontations achieve the desired results? On the contrary, they often lead to tragedies and loss of life. All of this once again testifies to the truthfulness of King Solomon’s inspired observation: “Man has dominated man to his harm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="116-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9</a>) In today’s text, James pointed out the key to finding true happiness and satisfaction. Jehovah, who gave that perfect law, knows best the things humans need in order to be completely happy and satisfied. He gave the first human couple everything that they needed to be happy​—including true freedom. <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:2018361/8-10"><em>w18.04 </em>3 ¶1-3</a></p>

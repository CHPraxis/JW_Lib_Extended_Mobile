The more we develop similar tender feelings for people, the more effective we will be in accomplishing our ministry. What can help us show fellow feeling to those to whom we preach? We want to put ourselves in the place of those we meet in the ministry and treat them as we would like to be treated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>) Consider the needs of each individual. Do not try to use the same approach with everyone we meet in our ministry. Rather, take into consideration the specific circumstances and viewpoints of each individual. Draw the person out with tactful questions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 20:5</a>) When we draw others out, we in effect allow them to tell us why they need the good news.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:44" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 24:42-44</a>) Meanwhile, exercise patience, being ever watchful. Read God’s Word each day, and be vigilant with a view to prayers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:7-60:4:7" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:7</a>) Take note of sterling examples of brothers and sisters whose lives reflect their joy in keeping on the watch as well as letting their light shine. Fill your life with upbuilding activity and association. That will bring you great joy, and it will seem to you that time is passing quickly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16</a>) It is faith-strengthening to know that our imperfection does not stop us from serving Jehovah acceptably. Consequently, appreciate Jehovah’s provision of “gifts in men,” congregation elders.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Jesus told his disciples not only to <em>be </em>in his love but to <em>“remain </em>in [his] love.” Why? Because living as a true disciple of Christ year after year calls for endurance. Jesus stressed the need for endurance by using forms of the word “remain” over and over in the brief passage recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:4-43:15:10" data-bid="102-1" class="b">John 15:4-10</a>. How do we show that we want to remain in Christ’s love and keep his approval? By observing Jesus’ commandments. Simply put, Jesus tells us, ‘Be obedient to me.’ Yet, Jesus only asked us to do what he himself did, for he added: “Just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.” Jesus sets the example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:15-43:13:15" data-bid="103-1" class="b">John 13:15</a>) By carrying out Jesus’ command to go and preach, we too show our love for God because Jesus’ commandments reflect his Father’s thinking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:5-40:17:5" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Matt. 17:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> John 8:28</a>) In response to our expression of love, Jehovah and Jesus keep us in their love. <a class="xt" data-xtid="40" href="jwpub://p/E:2018404/14-16"><em>w18.05 </em>18 ¶5-7</a></p>

The earlier you make plans by setting good goals, the sooner you will have success. Thousands of young ones in congregations all over the world deserve warm praise. They commit themselves to Jehovah and focus their lives on theocratic goals. Such young people enjoy life to the full while at the same time learning to follow Jehovah’s guidance in all endeavors. This also includes family life. “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,” wrote Solomon. “In all your ways take notice of him, and he will make your paths straight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) Youths in the Christian congregation are precious in the eyes of Jehovah, who loves them dearly and gives them his protection, guidance, and blessing. <a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:2018368/15-15"><em>w18.04 </em>26 ¶7;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:2018368/17-17"> 27 ¶9</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">The apostle John was a pillar in the early Christian congregation. His riveting Gospel account of Jesus’ ministry has been a source of encouragement to Christians throughout the centuries​—and still is. His Gospel alone preserves Jesus’ statement that love is the identifying mark of his true disciples.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="109-1" class="b">1 John 1:7</a>) And if our heart continues to condemn us, do we not get a lump in our throat and tears of gratitude in our eyes when we read that “God is greater than our hearts”?

For this reason, <em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>states: “The laws of every organized society form a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms and restrictions.” “Complicated” is surely the right word. Just think of the volumes and volumes of laws written by man, let alone the armies of lawyers and judges needed to interpret and administer them. Jesus’ direction for gaining true freedom involves two requirements: First, accept the truth that he taught, and second, become his disciple. Doing so will lead to true freedom. But freedom from what? Jesus went on to explain: “Every doer of sin is a slave of sin. . . .

He will help quiet our fears so that we can maintain our integrity to him, even if we face death.

Jehovah, however, advises you to take a different course. To be sure, he wants you to work hard while you are at school so that you are able to earn a living after you graduate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Col. 3:23</a>) But when you are deciding on your priorities in life, he encourages you to be guided by sound principles that take into account his purpose and his will for us during this time of the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Jehovah knows what lies ahead for the present world, and he knows how soon its end will come.

Of course not! Indeed, the account tells us that Samuel “was afraid to tell Eli of the vision.” However, God made clear to Eli that He was calling Samuel. As a result, Eli took charge of the situation and told Samuel to speak and not to hide “a single word.” Samuel obediently “told him everything,” and his words harmonized with an earlier message.

As the article states, there are people who “lie with ease, in ways big and small, to strangers, co-workers, friends, and loved ones.” What is the result of all this lying?

When Mary eventually gave birth to Jesus, Jehovah did not honor any of the prominent officials or rulers in Jerusalem and Bethlehem by letting them know what had happened. Angels appeared to lowly shepherds who were caring for sheep in the fields outside Bethlehem.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Why was Jehovah’s anger raised against Solomon? The Bible reports: “Because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah . . . , who had appeared to him twice and had warned him about this very thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded.” As a result, God withdrew his approval and support. Solomon’s heirs lost the unified kingdom of Israel and suffered many calamities for generations to come. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:9-11:11:13" data-bid="100-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:9-13</a>) As in Solomon’s case, one of the greatest threats to spirituality is friendship with those who do not understand or respect Jehovah’s standards. Some may be associated with the congregation but may be spiritually weak. Others could be relatives, neighbors, coworkers, or schoolmates who are not worshippers of Jehovah. In any case, if our close associates do not show a high regard for Jehovah’s standards, they can in time destroy our good standing with God. <a class="xt" data-xtid="168" href="jwpub://p/E:2018486/18-19"><em>w18.07 </em>19 ¶9-10</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Satan uses movies and television shows to spread his way of thinking. He understands that storytelling does much more than entertain us; it teaches us how to think, feel, and act. Jesus made good use of this method of teaching. Take, for example, his parables of the neighborly Samaritan and of the son who left home and wasted his inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:34-40:13:34" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Matt. 13:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:29-42:10:37" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> Luke 10:29-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:11-42:15:32" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 15:11-32</a>) However, those who are infected with Satan’s thinking can use storytelling to corrupt us. We need to be balanced. Movies and TV shows can entertain and educate us without contaminating our thinking. But we must be cautious. When choosing entertainment, we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Is this movie or TV show teaching me that it is all right to give in to my fleshly desires?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Gal. 5:19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:3" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:1-3</a>) What should you do if you detect that a program is promoting satanic thinking?

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">Just as a helmet protects a soldier’s brain, our “hope of salvation” protects our mind, our thinking ability.

Consider the way he dealt with Jesus. Satan surely knew that Jesus had the hope of eventually ruling mankind. But Jesus would have to wait until Jehovah’s appointed time. And before then, he would have to suffer and die. So Satan offered Jesus the chance to fulfill his hope sooner. Satan suggested that if Jesus would do one act of worship, he could have it all and have it right then. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:7" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-7</a>) Similarly, Satan knows that Jehovah offers us material benefits in the new system. But we have to wait, and we might have to suffer hardships in the meantime. So Satan offers us tempting opportunities to enjoy such a life now. He wants us to seek material benefits first​—to have it all and have it now. Satan urges us to seek the Kingdom second.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Matt. 6:31-33</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="163" href="jwpub://p/E:2018407/27-29"><em>w18.05 </em>30-31 ¶15-17</a></p>

Youths do this by reaching out for spiritual goals and by giving the preaching work high priority. Moreover, they make up their mind not to be distracted by this world. Adolescents can be sure that their hard work is not in vain.

How All Can Share in Caring for Our Places of Worship




Our Kingdom Halls are more than just buildings; they are places of worship dedicated to Jehovah. How can each of us share in caring for the Kingdom Hall?





WATCH THE VIDEO CARING FOR OUR PLACES OF WORSHIP, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
            What purposes do meeting places serve?

            Why should we keep the Kingdom Hall clean and well-maintained?

             How has participating in the maintenance program benefited you?

             Why is safety important, and what examples of safety did you observe in the video?

             How can we honor Jehovah by our donations?


HOW DO I PLAN TO SHARE?

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">Imagine two families living in the same dilapidated apartment building. One family is understandably in despair. Strangely, the other family is happy. Why? The second family will soon move to a beautiful new home.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="se">Although “all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now,” God’s servants have a hope that sustains them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:22-45:8:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 8:22</a>) We know that our present troubles, even those that have plagued us for decades, are “momentary and light” when compared to an eternity in God’s new world. Focusing on future Kingdom blessings will help us have a measure of joy and not give up.</p>

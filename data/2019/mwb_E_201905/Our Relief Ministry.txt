Our Relief Ministry




8:1-4; 9:7
Christians have a twofold ministry​—“the ministry of the reconciliation,” or our preaching and teaching work, and “the relief ministry” in behalf of fellow believers. (2Co 5:18-20; 8:4) Therefore, helping needy Christians is part of our sacred service. By having a share, we
  provide well for the needs of our brothers and sisters.​—2Co 9:12a

  help afflicted ones get back into their spiritual routine, which includes zealously sharing in the preaching work as an expression of their thanks to Jehovah.​—2Co 9:12b

  bring glory to Jehovah. (2Co 9:13) Relief work gives a witness to all, including those who have a negative view of Jehovah’s Witnesses

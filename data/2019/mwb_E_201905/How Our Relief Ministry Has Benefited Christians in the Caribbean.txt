LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
How Our Relief Ministry Has Benefited Christians in the Caribbean




Today, just as in the first century, we have the privilege of demonstrating love to fellow Christians who have experienced disasters. (Joh 13:34, 35) Watch the video Love in Action​—Relief Work in the Islands to see how Christians have responded to the needs of their brothers and sisters living in the Caribbean, and then answer the following questions:
  How were our brothers in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria?

  How has Jehovah helped our brothers in the Caribbean by means of fellow Christians?

  How were the victims of the hurricanes affected by the outpouring of love shown by their brothers?

  How many brothers and sisters have participated in disaster relief in the Caribbean?

  How may all of us have a share in relief work?

  How did this video make you feel about being part of this loving organization?

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS

  Song 92

  “How All Can Share in Caring for Our Places of Worship”: (15 min.) Discussion by an elder. After playing the video Caring for Our Places of Worship and considering the questions, briefly interview the congregation’s representative on the operating committee by asking the following questions. (If your congregation does not have a representative, interview the coordinator of the body of elders. If your congregation is the only one that meets in the Kingdom Hall, interview the maintenance coordinator.) How are we doing in keeping up with our regular maintenance schedule? Are we working safely? What maintenance work has been accomplished recently, and what is planned for the future? If someone has maintenance skills or would like to learn by assisting those with skills, what should he or she do? How can all of us, regardless of our circumstances, share in caring for the Kingdom Hall?

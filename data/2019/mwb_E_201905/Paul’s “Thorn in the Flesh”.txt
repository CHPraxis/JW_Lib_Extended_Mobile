Paul’s “Thorn in the Flesh”




12:7-10
In the Bible, thorns are often used in a figurative sense. They may describe people who are troublesome and cause injury or things that pose problems. (Nu 33:55; Pr 22:5; Eze 28:24) When Paul wrote about his “thorn in the flesh,” he may have been referring to false apostles and others who challenged his apostleship and work. How do the scriptures below indicate another possibility for Paul’s “thorn in the flesh”?





  Ac 23:1-5

  Ga 4:14, 15

  Ga 6:11


What is your “thorn in the flesh”?
How can you rely on Jehovah to help you endure?

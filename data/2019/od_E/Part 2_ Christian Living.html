Responding to what you have learned, you may have made a number of adjustments in your personal conduct and in your attitude toward life itself. Now that you have resolved to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards, you are in a position to render acceptable service as a minister of the good news.</p>

You will no doubt deepen your appreciation for Jehovah’s arrangements to educate and build up his people spiritually. These include congregation meetings that you will want to attend and participate in as your circumstances allow.</p>

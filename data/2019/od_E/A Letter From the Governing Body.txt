A Letter From the Governing Body




Dear Fellow Publishers of the Good News:
What an amazing privilege we have to be united in the worship of the only true God, Jehovah! We are his “fellow workers,” entrusted with the sacred and lifesaving work of preaching and teaching the good news of his established Kingdom. (1 Cor. 3:9; Matt. 28:19, 20) To accomplish this worldwide work in peace and unity, we must be well-organized.​—1 Cor. 14:40.
This book will help you to understand how the Christian congregation functions today. It discusses the privileges and responsibilities that you have as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. If you value your privileges and fulfill your responsibilities, you will be “made firm in the faith.”​—Acts 16:4, 5; Gal. 6:5.
Therefore, we encourage you to study this book carefully. Look for ways that you can apply the information in your own life. For example, if you have recently become an unbaptized publisher, what steps must you take to get baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? On the other hand, if you are baptized, what can you do to grow spiritually and expand your service to Jehovah? (1 Tim. 4:15) How can you contribute to the peace of the congregation? (2 Cor. 13:11) Look for the answers to these questions in this book.
If you are a baptized male, what can you do to qualify to serve as a ministerial servant and later as an elder? As thousands of new ones continue to flock to God’s organization, there is an urgent need for qualified brothers to take the lead. This book will help you to see what is involved in “reaching out” for these spiritual goals.​—1 Tim. 3:1.
We earnestly pray that this book will help you to see your place in Jehovah’s arrangement and to treasure it. We love all of you very much and continue to pray that you will be among those who eternally rejoice in worshipping our heavenly Father, Jehovah.​—Ps. 37:10, 11; Isa. 65:21-25.



Your brothers,
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

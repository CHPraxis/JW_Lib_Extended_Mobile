QUESTIONS FOR THOSE DESIRING TO GET BAPTIZED
Part 2: Christian Living




In your study of the Bible, you have gained knowledge about what Jehovah asks of you and how to measure up to his righteous standards. Responding to what you have learned, you may have made a number of adjustments in your personal conduct and in your attitude toward life itself. Now that you have resolved to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards, you are in a position to render acceptable service as a minister of the good news.
A review of the following questions will help you fix clearly in mind Jehovah’s righteous requirements and will remind you of some of the things you can do in order to be one of his approved servants. This information will impress on you the importance of doing all things with a good conscience and to Jehovah’s honor.​—2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Tim. 1:19; 1 Pet. 3:16, 21.
Having reached this point in your study, you are no doubt eager to be submissive to Jehovah’s rule and to become part of his organization. The questions and Scripture references will help you to examine your own understanding of submission to Jehovah’s arrangement, whether in the congregation, in the family, or in regard to the political elements of this system of things. You will no doubt deepen your appreciation for Jehovah’s arrangements to educate and build up his people spiritually. These include congregation meetings that you will want to attend and participate in as your circumstances allow.
Additionally, this section will consider the importance of having a regular share in the Kingdom-preaching work, helping others to come to know Jehovah and what he is doing for mankind. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Finally, it will impress on your mind the seriousness of your dedication to Jehovah God and your baptism. You can be certain that Jehovah appreciates your sincere response to his undeserved kindness expressed in your behalf.

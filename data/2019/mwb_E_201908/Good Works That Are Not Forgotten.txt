LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Good Works That Are Not Forgotten




All of Jehovahâ€™s people can build a record of good works in sacred service to our God. Like a loving parent who treasures the accomplishments of his children, Jehovah does not forget our work and the love we show for his name. (Mt 6:20; Heb 6:10) Of course, abilities and circumstances vary. Yet, if we do our best in our service to Jehovah, we can rejoice. (Ga 6:4; Col 3:23) Over the years, thousands of brothers and sisters have served at Bethel. Are you able to volunteer for Bethel service? If not, can you encourage someone else to do so or help a Bethel family member to continue serving in this special way?

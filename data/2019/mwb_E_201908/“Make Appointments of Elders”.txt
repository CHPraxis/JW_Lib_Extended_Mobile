“Make Appointments of Elders”




Tit 1:5-9





Titus was commissioned to “make appointments of elders in city after city.” This Biblical precedent is followed today when circuit overseers make appointments in the congregation.



GOVERNING BODY

Following the first-century pattern, the Governing Body entrusts circuit overseers with the serious responsibility to appoint elders and ministerial servants.








CIRCUIT OVERSEERS

Each circuit overseer must consider carefully and prayerfully the recommendations made by the elders and then appoint the men who qualify.








APPOINTED ELDERS

Even after elders are appointed, they must continue to meet the Scriptural qualifications.

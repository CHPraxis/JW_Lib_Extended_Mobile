<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In his inspired letter to Titus, the apostle Paul wrote that younger men, including Titus, should strive to be “an example of fine works in every way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:6-56:2:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Tit 2:6, 7</a>) Later in the same chapter, he indicated that Jehovah’s people are cleansed so that they may be “zealous for fine works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Tit 2:14</a>) One of those fine works is to preach and teach about God’s Kingdom. If you are a young one, can you use the strength of your youth to serve as an auxiliary or a regular pioneer?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:29-20:20:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Pr 20:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you would like to serve as a pioneer, develop a realistic plan of how you can become one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:28-42:14:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lu 14:28-30</a>) For instance, how will you support yourself financially while serving in the full-time ministry? How will you fulfill the hour requirement? Make your situation a matter of prayer to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:5-19:37:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 37:5</a>) Discuss your plan with your parents and those who have been successful as pioneers. Then take steps to reach your goal. Jehovah will surely bless your zealous efforts in his service!</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Spend Time With Those Who Love Jehovah




Why should we spend time with those who love Jehovah? Because our associates influence us either positively or negatively. (Pr 13:20) For instance, King Jehoash did “what was right in Jehovah’s eyes” as long as he spent time with High Priest Jehoiada. (2Ch 24:2) After Jehoiada died, Jehoash abandoned Jehovah because of bad association.​—2Ch 24:17-19.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul compared the Christian congregation to “a large house” and members of the congregation to “utensils,” or household implements. We remain “an instrument for an honorable use” when we avoid close association with anyone, even a member of our family or the congregation, who does what displeases Jehovah. (2Ti 2:20, 21) Therefore, may we continue to make friends with those who love Jehovah and who encourage us to serve him.

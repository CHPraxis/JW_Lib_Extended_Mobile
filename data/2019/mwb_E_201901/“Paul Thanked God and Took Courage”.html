<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the congregation in Rome heard that Paul was coming, a delegation of brothers journeyed some 40 miles (64 km) to meet him. How did their self-sacrificing love affect Paul? “On catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:15-44:28:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 28:15</a>) Although Paul was known for building up the congregations that he visited, on this occasion when he was a prisoner, he was the one who received encouragement.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:13:10-47:13:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Co 13:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today circuit overseers travel from congregation to congregation to build up the brothers and sisters. Like all of God’s people, at times they experience tiredness, anxiety, and discouragement. The next time the circuit overseer and his wife serve your congregation, what can you do to help them take courage, so that there is “an interchange of encouragement”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 1:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">Paul never stopped sharing his faith despite being a prisoner. While on the ship, he witnessed to crew members and fellow passengers. After being shipwrecked on Malta, he no doubt took the opportunity to share the good news with those he healed. Just three days after arriving in Rome, he called together the principal men of the Jews in order to witness to them. And during the two years of his house arrest, he preached to all who visited him.</p>

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 25-26
Paul Appeals to Caesar and Then Witnesses to King Herod Agrippa




25:11; 26:1-3, 28
Although we need not be anxious about what to say when “brought before governors and kings,” we should be “ready to make a defense” before everyone who demands a reason for our hope. (Mt 10:18-20; 1Pe 3:15) If opposers try to frame “trouble in the name of the law,” how can we imitate Paul’s example?​—Ps 94:20.
  We make use of legal provisions to defend the good news.​—Ac 25:11

  We are respectful when speaking to the authorities.​—Ac 26:2, 3

  If appropriate, we explain how the good news has benefited us and others.​—Ac 26:11-20

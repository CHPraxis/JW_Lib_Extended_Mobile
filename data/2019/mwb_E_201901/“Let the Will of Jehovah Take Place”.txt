TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ACTS 21-22
“Let the Will of Jehovah Take Place”




21:8-14
Paul felt that holy spirit was leading him to Jerusalem, where trouble awaited him. (Ac 20:22, 23) Therefore, when well-meaning Christians begged him not to go, he replied: “What are you doing by weeping and trying to weaken my resolve?” (Ac 21:13) We never want to dissuade others from pursuing a self-sacrificing course in their service to Jehovah.



How can we strengthen, not weaken, the resolve of a fellow Christian in the following circumstances?





  He is willing to accept humble work in order to expand his ministry instead of pursuing a lucrative career






  He wishes to transfer to another congregation in order to serve where the need is greater






  He makes great effort to share in the ministry despite poor health

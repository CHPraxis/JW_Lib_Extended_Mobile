<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>(a) Why can we say that the Mosaic Law was built on love? (b) As recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:40" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matthew 22:36-40</a>, what commandments did Jesus highlight?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We can say that the Mosaic Law was built on love because love motivates all that Jehovah does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) Jehovah founded that entire code of laws on two basic commands​—love God, and love your neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:5</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:40" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 22:36-40</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>So we can expect that each of the 600 and more commandments that make up the Law reveals a facet of Jehovah’s love. Let us look at some examples.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>5-6. </strong>What does Jehovah want married couples to do, and of what is Jehovah aware? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup>Be loyal to your marriage mate, and care for your children. </strong>Jehovah wants married couples to develop a love so strong that it lasts for life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:3-40:19:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 19:3-6</a>) Adultery is one of the most unloving crimes a person can commit. With good reason, the seventh of the Ten Commandments prohibited adultery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:18-5:5:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 5:18</a>) It is a sin “against God” and a cruel blow to a marriage mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 39:7-9</a>) A victim of adultery might feel the pain of betrayal for decades.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah is keenly aware of how marriage mates treat each other. He particularly wanted Israelite wives to be treated well. A husband who respected the Law would love his wife and would not divorce her for trivial reasons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:1-5:24:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 24:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:3-40:19:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matt. 19:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:8-40:19:8" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 8</a>) But if a serious problem arose and he did divorce her, he had to give her a certificate of divorce. This certificate protected a woman from false accusations of immorality. In addition, before the husband could give his wife the certificate of divorce, he apparently had to consult the city elders. In this way, the elders would have the opportunity to try to help the couple save their marriage. When an Israelite man divorced his wife for selfish reasons, Jehovah did not always intervene. Nevertheless, he saw the tears that the wife shed, and he felt her pain.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:13-39:2:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mal. 2:13-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>7-8. </strong>(a) What did Jehovah command parents to do? (See cover picture.) (b) What lessons do we learn?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The Law also reveals that Jehovah cares deeply about the welfare of children. Jehovah commanded parents to provide not only for their children’s physical needs but also for their spiritual needs. Parents were to take every opportunity to help their children appreciate Jehovah’s Law and learn to love him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:13-5:7:13" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7:13</a>) One of the reasons the Israelites were punished by Jehovah was that they mistreated some of their children in a shocking way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:31-24:7:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer. 7:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:33-24:7:33" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Parents were to view their children, not as mere property that they could neglect or mistreat, but as an inheritance, a gift from Jehovah to be cherished.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup><em>Lessons: </em></strong>Jehovah pays close attention to how marriage mates treat each other. He wants parents to love their children, and he holds parents accountable for the way they treat them.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>9-11. </strong>Why did Jehovah give the law prohibiting coveting?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Do not covet. </strong>The last of the Ten Commandments prohibited coveting, or developing a wrong desire for what belongs to another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:21-5:5:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 5:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:7-45:7:7" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Rom. 7:7</a>) <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Jehovah gave this law to teach a valuable lesson​—his people must guard their heart, that is, their thoughts, feelings, and reasonings. He knows that wicked acts begin as wicked thoughts and feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>) If an Israelite allowed wrong desires to grow in his heart, he would likely treat others in an unloving way. King David, for example, fell into that trap. Normally, he was a good man. But on one occasion, he coveted another man’s wife. His desire led to sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15</a>) David committed adultery, tried to deceive the woman’s husband, and then had him killed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:11:2-10:11:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Sam. 11:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:7-10:12:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah knew when an Israelite broke the law about coveting​—He can read hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>) The law against coveting told his people that they should avoid thoughts that lead to bad behavior. What a wise and loving Father Jehovah is!</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup><em>Lessons: </em></strong>Jehovah sees beyond a person’s outward appearance. He sees what we really are inside, in our heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:7</a>) No thought, no feeling, no action can be kept secret from him. He looks for and encourages the good in us. But he wants us to identify and control wrong thoughts before they become wrong actions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:27-40:5:30" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:27-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The Mosaic Law also emphasizes that Jehovah loves justice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:8-23:61:8" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Isa. 61:8</a>) He set the perfect example of how to treat others fairly. When the Israelites obeyed the laws that Jehovah gave, he blessed them. When they ignored his just and righteous standards, they suffered. Consider two more laws from the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>13-14. </strong>What did the first two of the Ten Commandments require, and how would obeying those laws have benefited the Israelites?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>Worship Jehovah exclusively. </strong>The first two of the Ten Commandments required that the Israelites devote themselves exclusively to Jehovah and warned against the worship of idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:3-2:20:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ex. 20:3-6</a>) Those commandments were not for Jehovah’s benefit. Rather, they were for the benefit of his people. When his people remained loyal to him, they prospered. When they worshipped the gods of other nations, they suffered.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Think about the Canaanites. They worshipped lifeless idols rather than the true and living God. As a result, they degraded themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:4-19:115:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 115:4-8</a>) As part of their worship, they engaged in defiling sexual acts and horrifying child sacrifices. Likewise, when the Israelites ignored Jehovah and chose to worship idols, they degraded themselves and hurt their families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:1-14:28:4" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:1-4</a>) Those in authority abandoned Jehovah’s standards of justice.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:1-26:34:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezek. 34:1-4</a>) Jehovah warned the Israelites that he would execute judgment on those who victimized defenseless women and children.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The Mosaic Law covered many aspects of an Israelite’s life, so it was vital that the appointed older men judge Jehovah’s people with righteous judgment. They were responsible for handling not only spiritual matters but also civil and criminal cases. Note the following examples.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>If an Israelite killed someone, he was not arbitrarily executed. The elders of his city would investigate the circumstances before deciding if the death penalty was appropriate.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jehovah wanted to save his people from the corrupting influence of neighboring nations. So he required that the elders and judges enforce the Law impartially. However, those doing the judging were not to treat his people in a harsh or rigid manner.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Jehovah has compassion for his people, so he put safeguards in place to prevent individuals from being treated unfairly. For example, the Law limited the possibility that a person would be falsely accused of a crime. A defendant had the right to know who was accusing him.

And he held those who mistreated them to account.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:22-2:22:24" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 22:22-24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>The Law also protected family members from sex crimes by forbidding all forms of incest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:6-3:18:30" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Lev. 18:6-30</a>) Unlike the people of the nations surrounding Israel, who tolerated or even condoned this practice, Jehovah’s people were to view this type of crime as Jehovah did​—as a detestable act.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup><em>Lessons: </em></strong>Jehovah wants those he places in positions of responsibility to take a loving interest in all whom they oversee. He hates sex crimes and wants to ensure that all, especially the most vulnerable, receive protection and justice.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Love and justice are like breath and life; on earth, one does not exist without the other. When we are convinced that Jehovah is treating us justly, our love for him grows. And when we love God and love his righteous standards, we feel impelled to love others and treat them justly.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>The Mosaic Law covenant breathed life into the relationship between Jehovah and the Israelites. However, the Law was done away with after Jesus fulfilled the Law, and it was replaced with something even better. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:4-45:10:4" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Rom. 10:4</a>) The apostle Paul described the Law as “a shadow of the good things to come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1</a>) The next article in this series will discuss some of those good things and the role that love and justice play in the Christian congregation.</p>

Sometimes this term is used with reference to the entire inspired Hebrew Scriptures.</p></div>

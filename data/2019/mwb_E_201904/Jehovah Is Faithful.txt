Jehovah Is Faithful




10:13





Jehovah might choose to remove a trial; however, he often makes “the way out” by providing what we need so that we can endure the trial successfully.
  He can soothe our mind, our heart, and our emotions by means of his Word, his holy spirit, and the spiritual food he provides.​—Mt 24:45; Joh 14:16, ftn.; Ro 15:4

  He may guide us by means of holy spirit, which can help us remember Bible accounts and principles and then discern the wise steps to take.​—Joh 14:26

  He can use his angels in our behalf.​—Heb 1:14

  He can help us through fellow worshippers.​—Col 4:11

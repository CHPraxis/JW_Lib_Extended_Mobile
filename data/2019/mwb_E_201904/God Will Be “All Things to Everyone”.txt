God Will Be “All Things to Everyone”




15:24-28
A glorious future awaits those who prove faithful to Jehovah. His promises are impressed on our hearts when we speak enthusiastically about our hope to others. The apostle Paul encouraged fellow Christians to imagine the time at the close of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign when Jehovah will be “all things to everyone.”

<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>What role did stewards play in Bible times?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>IN Bible times, a steward managed the household or property of another person. The Hebrew and Greek words translated “steward” sometimes refer to an overseer or a household manager.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Joseph, a son of the patriarch Jacob, was a slave in Egypt, Joseph became the steward over the house of his master. In fact, his Egyptian master “left everything that was his in Joseph’s care.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:2-1:39:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 39:2-6</a>) Later, when Joseph himself became a powerful ruler in Egypt, he appointed a steward over his own house.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:4-1:44:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 44:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In Jesus’ day, landowners often lived in cities away from their agricultural estates. So the landowners appointed stewards to oversee the day-to-day activities of the laborers who tended the land of these estates.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Who was qualified for the position of steward? The first-century Roman writer Columella advised that a slave who was appointed as an overseer, or a steward, should be “one who [had] been tested by experience.” He would be an individual who had “such qualities of feeling that he [would] exercise authority without laxness and without cruelty.” He added: “This above all else is to be required of him​—that he shall not think that he knows what he does not know, and that he shall always be eager to learn.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God’s Word uses the figure of a steward to illustrate some of the activities that take place in the Christian congregation. For example, the apostle Peter encourages Christians to use their God-given abilities “in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus himself used the example of a steward in the illustration recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:1-42:16:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 16:1-8</a>. Moreover, in a prophecy about the sign of his presence as King, Jesus assured his followers that he would appoint a “faithful and discreet slave,” or “faithful steward.” The main assignment of that steward would be to provide a steady supply of spiritual food for Christ’s followers during the time of the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:42-42:12:42" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 12:42</a>) We are grateful to be among the recipients of the faith-strengthening publications that the faithful steward prepares and makes available worldwide.</p>

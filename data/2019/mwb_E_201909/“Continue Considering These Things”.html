<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What things? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8</a> says to consider things that are true, of serious concern, righteous, chaste, lovable, well-spoken-of, virtuous, and praiseworthy. Of course, Christians are not restricted to thinking only on Scriptural topics. However, the meditation of our heart should be pleasing to Jehovah. It should not weaken our resolve to be faithful to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:14-19:19:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 19:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We have a challenge to avoid unwholesome thoughts. We must contend not only with our own imperfect flesh but also with Satan, “the god of this system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Co 4:4</a>) Because he controls the world’s mass media, much of the content on television, the radio, the Internet, and in print is debased. If we are not selective in what we fill our mind with, our thinking will be corrupted, and eventually our conduct will be affected.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas 1:14, 15</a>.</p>

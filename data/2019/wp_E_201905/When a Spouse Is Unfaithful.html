<div class="openingContent metaIntro"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I wanted to die when my husband said that he was leaving me for a younger woman. It all seemed so unfair, especially when I remembered the sacrifices I had made for him.”​—Maria, Spain.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“When my wife suddenly left me, it seemed that something died inside me. Our dreams, our hopes, and our plans had been destroyed. There were days when I thought I was free from anxiety, only to find myself back in the depths of despair.”​—Bill, Spain.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Despite the heartache, many innocent spouses have found comfort in the Scriptures. They have learned that God sees their tears and shares their pain.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:13-39:2:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Malachi 2:13-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:19-19:94:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 94:19</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“As I read that verse, I imagined Jehovah soothing my pain tenderly, as a compassionate father would,” recalls Bill.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“With someone loyal you act in loyalty.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:25-19:18:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 18:25</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“My husband had not been loyal,” explains Carmen, whose husband had been unfaithful for months. “But I could trust in Jehovah’s loyalty. He would never let me down.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication . . . let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 4:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“I read this text over and over again,” says Sasha. “As I prayed more and more, God gave me peace in my life.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">All those quoted above felt like giving up at times. But they trusted in Jehovah God and drew strength from his Word. Bill put it this way: “My faith gave meaning to my life when everything else seemed to have collapsed. Though I walked for a time ‘in the valley of deep shadow,’ God was with me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:4-19:23:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 23:4</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sc"><strong>Meditate on comforting scriptures.</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc">“I read the book of Job and then the Psalms,” explains Bill, “underlining every passage that seemed to fit my own circumstances. I realized that these Bible writers had experienced the kind of pain and anxiety that I was feeling.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se"><strong>Find consolation in music.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc">“When I could not sleep at night, I listened to music,” Carmen remembers. “This was a great source of comfort.” Daniel says: “I learned to play the guitar and found that the harmony needed for the music helped me recover my inner peace and harmony.”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se"><strong>Talk about your feelings.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sc">“I was not used to talking about my feelings,” Daniel says. “But I had some good friends, and I reached out to them every day. I unburdened my feelings on them, both in writing and in conversation. That really helped.” Sasha says: “The help of my family was crucial. My mother was always there for me. If I wanted to talk, she was there to listen. My father also made me feel secure, and he helped me recover at my own pace.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><strong>Persist in prayer.</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sc">“I prayed constantly,” says Carmen. “I felt that God was near to me, listening to me, and helping me. Through this terrible time, I drew closer to God.”</p>

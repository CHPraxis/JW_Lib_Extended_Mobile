<div class="openingContent metaIntro"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Faizal</strong> required major heart surgery just over a year after his wife died. He says: “When I read the book of Job, I know Jehovah put it there for a reason. When we find an example in the Bible that we can relate to, it is a way of soothing our pain of heart.” He adds: “Life is still worth living.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa"><strong>Tarsha</strong> was young when her mother died. She says: “Knowing our Creator is what gives life purpose, hope, and joy despite all the things we may have to deal with. Jehovah is more than capable of sustaining us and helping us to get through each day.”</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">THE PRECEDING articles show how various traumatic events can make life seem unbearable. As you carry your own personal burden, you may wonder if life is worthwhile or whether anyone even cares about you. Be assured that God does care about your distress. You are precious to him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:0-19:86:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 86</a> expressed confidence toward God: “I call on you in the day of my distress, for you will answer me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:7-19:86:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 86:7</a>) You may wonder, though, ‘How will God answer me “in the day of my distress”?’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Although God may not take away your problems immediately, his Word, the Bible, assures you that he can give you inner peace to help you cope: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>, footnote) Please consider how the following Bible verses give us assurance of God’s tender care.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>CONSIDER:</strong> Seemingly insignificant birds are not inconsequential to God. Not even one tiny sparrow escapes God’s notice; every one is a precious living creature. Humans are far more valuable to God than sparrows are. Humans, as the centerpiece of God’s earthly creation, are made in his “image” and are capable of cultivating and displaying his elevated qualities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26, 27</a>.</p>

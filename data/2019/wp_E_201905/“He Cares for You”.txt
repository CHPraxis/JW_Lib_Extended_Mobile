“He Cares for You”









Even if others in your life may fail you, there is One who will never leave you. Who is that?
King David of old said: “Even if my own father and mother abandon me, Jehovah himself will take me in.”​—Psalm 27:10.
Jehovah is “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our trials.”​—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.
“Throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”​—1 Peter 5:7.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb"><strong>2. </strong>Listed below are offenses that may require review by a judicial committee. Of course, this list is not comprehensive. There may be other matters that would also merit the attention of a judicial committee. The elders must use good judgment and reasonableness when evaluating the seriousness of the alleged wrongdoing. They should consider the extent and nature of the misconduct, intent and motive, frequency or practice, and so forth. If there is a question about whether certain wrongdoing merits judicial action, the body of elders may write to the Service Department requesting further direction concerning the case.</p>

There must have been another party to the immorality​—a human of either sex or a beast. Willing participation incurs guilt and requires judicial action. It is not a casual touching of the sex organs but involves the manipulation of the genitals. It includes oral sex, anal sex, and manipulation of the genitals between individuals not married to each other.

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb"><strong>6. </strong>When determining if an individual is guilty of <em>por·neiʹa, </em>it is important to establish the facts. This is especially true when Scriptural freedom to remarry is involved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:16-39:2:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mal. 2:16a</a>) In situations in which the elders are uncertain or divided on their conclusions, it is best to write the Service Department.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/175-183">See 12:71-76</a>.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb"><strong>7. Strong Circumstantial Evidence of Sexual Immorality (<em>Por·neiʹa</em>): </strong>If at least two eyewitnesses report that the accused stayed all night in the same house with a person of the opposite sex (or with a known homosexual) under improper circumstances, judicial action may be warranted. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="143" href="jwpub://p/E:2018484/1-5"><em>w18.07 </em>p. 32</a>) The elders cannot apply one rule to every case; each situation has unique circumstances. After two elders have thoroughly investigated, the body of elders must use good judgment in determining whether serious wrongdoing has occurred. If the elders are unsure how to proceed, they should consult with the Service Department.​—If questions are raised regarding Scriptural freedom to remarry, see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/175-183">Chapter 12, paragraphs 71-76</a>.</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(1) </span>Have the couple been pursuing a romantic relationship? Have they been previously counseled regarding their conduct with each other? What circumstances led to their spending the night together? Did they plan ahead to do so? Did they have a choice in the matter, or were there extenuating circumstances, perhaps an unforeseen occurrence or genuine emergency that left them with no choice but to spend the night together? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11</a>) What were the sleeping arrangements? Since each situation is different, there may be other relevant factors. If there are no extenuating circumstances, a judicial committee would be formed on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence of sexual immorality.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(2) </span>Depending upon the attitude of the accused, there might even be evidence of brazen conduct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb"><strong>8. </strong>Consider an example in which judicial action would be warranted: A married brother spends an inordinate amount of time with his female secretary after work hours but insists there is no romantic interest. His concerned wife informs the elders, who give him strong counsel. Later, when he claims to be leaving overnight for a “business trip,” his suspicious wife and a relative follow him to the secretary’s home. They observe the secretary invite him inside at 10 p.m. and continue watching <em>all night </em>until he leaves the home at 7 a.m. When the elders speak to him, he admits that he spent the night with his secretary, but he denies that he committed adultery. In such a case, the elders have a basis to take judicial action because there is strong circumstantial evidence of <em>por·neiʹa </em>and there may be elements of brazen conduct. The innocent mate’s conscience may allow her to divorce him and remarry; she should not be criticized if that is her decision.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sb"><strong>9. </strong>Below are examples in which judicial action would likely not be warranted:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(1) </span>An elderly Christian living alone has a member of the opposite sex move into the home to help care for him. There is no evidence of a romantic attachment or reason to suspect sexual immorality.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(2) </span>After attending a social gathering at a single sister’s home, a brother walks to a train station to catch the train home. After waiting for some time, the brother learns that the last train for the day has already left the station. He walks back to the sister’s home, but by the time he arrives, everyone has left and it is quite late. The sister allows him to sleep in the living room while she sleeps in her bedroom.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(3) </span>A single brother visits a married couple for several days. One night after everyone goes to bed, the husband is called to an emergency at his place of work and does not return until morning. The wife and the single brother are alone in the home all night sleeping in separate bedrooms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb"><strong>10. Adulterous Marriage: </strong>If a divorced person remarries and he was not Scripturally free to do so​—in other words, if adultery and rejection by the innocent mate had not occurred—​he has entered into an adulterous marriage. In Jehovah’s eyes, he has married someone while still bound to another. Entering into such a marriage would call for judicial action.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/180-183">See 12:76</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb"><strong>11. </strong>The elders should be very cautious in extending any special privileges to such an individual, even after judicial restrictions have been lifted. He could share in the cleaning and repair of the local Kingdom Hall. He may eventually present student assignments on the midweek meeting if his doing so would not disturb others. However, he would not be assigned to help with literature, accounts, attendants, sound, video, or similar privileges in the congregation as long as the innocent former mate is alive, unmarried, and has not been guilty of <em>por·neiʹa.</em></p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sb"><strong>12. </strong>Although a Christian’s remarriage may not be adulterous, if he deliberately committed adultery in a scheming way so as to end his previous marriage or he pressured his innocent mate to reject him so that she eventually agreed to a divorce, he has dealt treacherously with her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:14-39:2:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mal. 2:14-16</a>) His conduct is similar to entering into an adulterous marriage, and he would not qualify for special privileges for many years.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018135/71-72">See 22:26-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb"><strong>13. Child Abuse: </strong>Child abuse includes the sexual or physical abuse of a minor. It would also include the extreme neglect of a minor by her parent. Child sexual abuse is a perversion and generally includes sexual intercourse with a minor; oral or anal sex with a minor; fondling the genitals, breasts, or buttocks of a minor; voyeurism of a minor; indecent exposure to a minor; or soliciting a minor for sexual conduct.

<h2 id="p118" data-pid="118"><strong>EVIDENCE ESTABLISHING WRONGDOING</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="sb"><strong>40. </strong>Even though a Christian has been accused of wrongdoing serious enough to require judicial action, a judicial committee should not be formed unless the wrongdoing has been established by sufficient evidence. Please note the following regarding evidence:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p120" data-pid="120" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(1) </span><strong>Confession: </strong>Admission of wrongdoing, either written or oral, may be accepted as conclusive proof without other corroborating evidence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:19-6:7:19" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Josh. 7:19</a>) There must be two witnesses to a confession, and the confession must be clear and unambiguous. For example, a statement from a married Christian that his mate is “Scripturally free” would not by itself be viewed as a clear confession of adultery. A guilty plea entered in court by a Christian as part of a plea bargain, perhaps on the advice of an attorney so as to avoid the possibility of a harsher sentence, would generally not in itself be viewed by the congregation as an admission of guilt.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p121" data-pid="121" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(2) </span><strong>Eyewitnesses: </strong>There must be two or three eyewitnesses, not just people repeating hearsay; no action can be taken if there is only one witness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:15-5:19:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Deut. 19:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:17" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> John 8:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:19-54:5:19" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:24-54:5:25" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) If there are two or three witnesses to the same kind of wrongdoing but each one is witness to a separate incident, the elders can consider their testimony. While such evidence is acceptable to establish guilt, it is preferable to have two witnesses to the same occurrence of wrongdoing. The testimony of youths may be considered; it is up to the elders to determine whether the testimony has the ring of truth. The testimony of unbelievers and disfellowshipped or disassociated ones may also be considered, but it must be weighed carefully.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p122" data-pid="122" class="sb"><strong>41. </strong>If wrongdoing has not been established but serious questions have been raised, the body of elders should appoint two elders to investigate the matter promptly. For example, there may be just one witness. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the witness to encourage the accused to approach the elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:14" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14</a>) The elders can then allow the accused a few days to approach them. In other cases, it may not be advisable for the witness to confront the accused. For example, the witness may be extremely timid. A victim of rape or of child sexual abuse is never required to confront the accused. (If the accusation involves child sexual abuse, <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018127/">see Chapter 14</a>.) Whether the witness approaches the accused or not, the two elders appointed should speak with the accused regarding the accusation.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="119" href="jwpub://p/E:1997607/7:168-18:124"><em>w97 </em>8/15 p. 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p123" data-pid="123" class="sb"><strong>42. </strong>If the accused denies the accusation, the investigating elders should try to arrange a meeting with him and the accuser together. (If the accusation involves child sexual abuse, <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018127/">see Chapter 14</a>.) If the accuser or the accused is unwilling to meet with the elders or if the accused continues to deny the accusation of a single witness and the wrongdoing is not established, the matter cannot be handled judicially. The investigating elders should compose a record, sign it, put it in a sealed envelope, and give it to the secretary to be placed in the congregation’s confidential file. (<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018135/55-72">See 22:21-27</a>.) Additional evidence may later come to light to establish matters.</p>

In either case, the coordinator of the body of elders should arrange for an elder to make the following announcement at the next midweek meeting: “[Name of person] is no longer recognized as an unbaptized publisher.” Because of his unrepentant wrongdoing, it would be best for a time not to call on him if he raises his hand to comment at meetings.</p>
<p id="p141" data-pid="141" class="sb"><strong>52. </strong>If the elders see that such a person is a threat to the flock, they can privately warn those endangered. For example, despite the announcement, the wrongdoer might attempt to socialize with youths in the congregation. In that situation, the elders would speak privately to the parents of the endangered ones and perhaps to those youths.</p>
<p id="p142" data-pid="142" class="sb"><strong>53. </strong>There is no specific arrangement for an appeal or a seven-day waiting period before announcing the decision that one is no longer recognized as an unbaptized publisher. If he expresses dissatisfaction with the conclusion, the body of elders should choose two different elders to review the case.</p>
<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="sb"><strong>54. </strong>If someone who was previously removed as an unbaptized publisher begins to make progress and wishes once again to share in the ministry, two elders (perhaps those who met with him earlier) should meet with him to determine his qualifications. If he qualifies, the coordinator of the body of elders should arrange for an announcement to be made that he is an unbaptized publisher. There is no need to wait until he reports field service again to make the announcement.</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="sb"><strong>55. </strong>If the unbaptized publisher is a minor, the two elders should meet with the Christian parents to discern what occurred, the child’s attitude, and the corrective steps that the parents are taking. If the parents have the situation in hand, the two elders may discern that it is not necessary to include the minor in the meeting. The elders will check with the parents from time to time to offer helpful counsel, specific suggestions, and loving encouragement.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018127/65-66">See Chapter 14, paragraphs 29-30</a>, if the minor engaged in sexual misconduct.</p>

<p id="p161" data-pid="161" class="sb"><strong>61. </strong>At times a wrongdoer will claim that his baptism is not valid and that he feels he is not accountable to a judicial committee because he secretly engaged in wrongdoing shortly before he was baptized. If the elders had been aware of his serious wrongdoing committed just before baptism, likely they would not have approved him for baptism. However, this does not necessarily mean that he did not make a valid dedication. Some individuals make a dedication long before their baptism; others have made a dedication shortly before. The elders are not in a position to read the heart and know for a certainty how Jehovah viewed the person at the time he was baptized. If the elders learn that a baptized individual secretly engaged in serious wrongdoing while he was an unbaptized publisher but the wrongdoing ceased before baptism, they should give counsel and encouragement. A judicial committee should not be formed for prebaptism wrongdoing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:9-11</a>) However, if the individual resumed serious wrongdoing after baptism, the elders would generally deal with him on the basis of what he has professed to be, a dedicated and baptized Christian, and would meet with him judicially.</p>
<p id="p162" data-pid="162" class="sb"><strong>62. </strong>There are rare occasions when it is obvious that the baptism was invalid because serious wrongdoing did not cease before baptism, even for a brief period of time. For example, it may be that at the time of baptism, the individual was living immorally with a member of the opposite sex or the same sex, was a member of a nonneutral organization, or something similar. If there are questions, the Service Department should be consulted.</p>

<p id="p165" data-pid="165" class="sb"><strong>64. </strong>If a wrongdoer moves before a case has been concluded, it is usually best for the elders of the original congregation to follow through if possible and if distance permits. They are acquainted with the person and his circumstances. If he has moved a great distance away, the elders of the original congregation should not insist on handling matters if the wrongdoer says he is unable to return to the congregation for the meeting. In such a case, it may be advisable to refer matters to the elders of the congregation where he now lives. There should be good communication between the two bodies.</p>
<p id="p166" data-pid="166" class="sb"><strong>65. </strong>If the elders learn that a publisher who is visiting the area for a short period of time is guilty of wrongdoing, they should promptly report the matter to the elders of his congregation.</p>

Does the other individual admit the wrong? Do their accounts match, or are there significant differences? The elders handling the matter should communicate freely and cooperate in obtaining the facts.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p170" data-pid="170" class="sb"><strong>67. </strong>If a publisher were to allow an individual to commit sexual immorality while living in the publisher’s home, he would be giving tacit approval to immoral conduct. This would also be true of allowing an individual to commit sexual immorality while visiting the publisher’s home. Such a publisher would not be exemplary.</p>
<p id="p171" data-pid="171" class="sb"><strong>68. </strong>When congregation elders come to know of such a situation, they should patiently provide Scriptural counsel. The publisher should be helped to see that what he is allowing could stumble others. He may then take action to change the situation so as “not to put a stumbling block or an obstacle before a brother.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:13-45:14:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Rom. 14:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p172" data-pid="172" class="sb"><strong>69. </strong>Perhaps the publisher is genuinely concerned that what he has been allowing may be a cause for stumbling. For certain reasons, however, he may feel that he has no recourse at the present time. For example, elderly Witness parents may need the assistance of an unbelieving son or daughter. Under such circumstances, no judicial action would be taken, but the qualifications of the publisher to serve in an exemplary position would be reviewed by the body of elders.</p>
<p id="p173" data-pid="173" class="sb"><strong>70. </strong>Suppose the publisher, upon being approached by the elders, manifests a brazen attitude, not really caring if others are stumbled. Even if he does not encourage others to do what he is doing, the elders may decide to arrange for a talk to be given that serves as a warning to the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:14-53:3:15" data-bid="47-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:14, 15</a>; <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/185-188">see 12:77-80</a>.) On the other hand, if a baptized publisher actively promotes allowing individuals to commit sexual immorality in the home, then the matter could be handled judicially on the grounds of condoning sexual immorality, causing divisions, and, in effect, speaking against “the teaching of the Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:11" data-bid="48-1" class="b">2 John 9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:20" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:20-66:2:20" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> Rev. 2:20</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p175" data-pid="175" class="sb"><strong>71. </strong>It is the responsibility of the individual desiring to remarry to produce convincing evidence to establish Scriptural freedom to remarry. If an individual’s divorce occurred before baptism, the elders should not assume the individual is Scripturally free, as baptism does not dissolve previous marital ties. Elders should be very careful when it comes to giving direction on whether an individual is Scripturally free and should consult with the Service Department on any questions. This is especially true since the decisions a person makes in such matters will affect not only his relationship with his marriage mate but also his relationship with Jehovah. Elders shoulder a heavy responsibility in such matters and need to be cautious when offering counsel, especially when the answer may not be readily apparent.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:48-42:12:48" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 12:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:1-59:3:1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Jas. 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p176" data-pid="176" class="sb"><strong>72. </strong>Scriptural freedom to remarry requires three conditions: (1) sexual immorality (<em>por·neiʹa</em>); (2) a rejection (refusal to reconcile) by the innocent mate; and (3) a legal, final divorce. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:31-40:5:32" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matt. 5:31, 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 19:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> Heb. 13:4</a>) For example, if an individual contemplating remarriage confesses that he has been guilty of sexual immorality after his former mate legally divorced him or if his former mate has admitted to committing sexual immorality since the legal divorce, both are Scripturally free to remarry.</p>
<p id="p177" data-pid="177" class="sb"><strong>73. </strong>If a baptized Christian who accuses his believing mate of adultery and wishes to establish freedom to divorce and remarry approaches an elder, the matter should be referred to the body of elders. The accuser is not free unless the evidence establishing wrongdoing is sufficient to warrant the formation of a judicial committee on a charge of <em>por·neiʹa</em>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:15-5:19:15" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Deut. 19:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:17" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> John 8:17</a>) If the accused mate is associated with another congregation, the evidence should be presented to the elders of that congregation for review and a determination. The publisher should be advised that he is not to view himself as Scripturally free until the elders have investigated the matter and guilt of <em>por·neiʹa </em>is established.</p>
<p id="p178" data-pid="178" class="sb"><strong>74. </strong>In some cases adultery is not established. However the accused may confess or two eyewitnesses may report that the accused stayed all night in the same house with a person of the opposite sex (or a known homosexual) under improper circumstances. (<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/60-67">See 12:7-9</a>.) The elders should carefully consider the situation. (<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018125/81-82">See 12:7.1</a>.) Although the elders cannot tell the innocent mate that he is free to remarry, if the innocent mate is convinced that adultery did occur, the elders may allow him to take responsibility before Jehovah for obtaining a Scriptural divorce; if he remarries, no judicial action will be taken.</p>
<p id="p179" data-pid="179" class="sb"><strong>75. </strong>Even if the accused mate is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses (disfellowshipped, disassociated, or never baptized), two witnesses are also generally required to establish wrongdoing that would provide a basis for Scriptural freedom. An exception may be made, however, if the unbeliever privately makes an unambiguous confession of adultery to the Christian mate. In such a case, if the innocent Christian mate believes that the confession is true and does not wish to reconcile, he can submit a letter to the elders outlining his situation. The body of elders should then consider the letter. Is there any known reason to conclude other than that the unbelieving mate has been immoral? For example, was the confession worded ambiguously? Did the unbeliever later deny making the confession? If the unbeliever is willing to speak with the elders and matters are unclear, the elders may choose to ask the accused mate directly. If there is no known reason to conclude otherwise, the innocent mate can be allowed to take responsibility before Jehovah for obtaining a Scriptural divorce; if he remarries, no judicial action will be taken.</p>
<p id="p180" data-pid="180" class="sb"><strong>76. </strong>The following constitutes rejection by the innocent mate:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p181" data-pid="181" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(1) </span>The innocent mate initiates a divorce either before or after learning of the adultery.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p182" data-pid="182" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(2) </span>The innocent mate signs a divorce decree or in some other way indicates he does not object to a divorce initiated by the guilty mate, either before or after learning of the adultery. In some lands it is possible for the innocent mate to sign legal documents that stipulate custody of the children and financial support without indicating he agrees with the divorce; his signing such papers in itself would not indicate a rejection.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:2000926/1-12"><em>w00 </em>12/15 pp. 28-29</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p183" data-pid="183" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(3) </span>Though verbally expressing forgiveness and not seeking a divorce, the innocent mate refuses to resume sexual relations for a very prolonged period of time, a year or even years. Before indicating to the guilty mate that he is free to pursue a Scriptural divorce, the elders should consult with the Service Department. The innocent mate is not required to make a quick decision to forgive or not.</p>

<p id="p186" data-pid="186" class="sb"><strong>78. </strong>If the disorderly conduct is <em>generally unknown to others </em>and poses no threat to their spiritual well-being, usually it is best to handle things through admonition and counsel. The body of elders should not be hasty in deciding to give a warning talk. However, if the individual does not see the error of his way but continues to be an unwholesome influence, a warning talk may be given to the congregation. Elders must use reasonableness and discernment in determining whether a particular situation is sufficiently serious and disturbing to require a warning talk.</p>
<p id="p187" data-pid="187" class="sb"><strong>79. </strong>For example, if a baptized Christian is dating an ‘unbeliever,’ the elders should first counsel him and try to help him.

If an individual is dating an <em>unbaptized publisher, </em>a warning talk may not be needed. Much would depend on the circumstances, on the attitude of the Christian, on the level of disturbance to the congregation, and other factors. Nonetheless, if he is dating with a view to marrying someone who is unbaptized, he is not obeying the Bible’s counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a> to marry “only in the Lord,” and loving counsel should be given.</p>

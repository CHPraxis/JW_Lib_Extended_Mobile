Introduction




1. As an appointed elder, you have the serious responsibility to “shepherd the flock of God under your care.” (1 Pet. 5:2, 3) Providing accurate theocratic direction to our brothers and sisters is a weighty responsibility. It is important that elders locate Scriptural and theocratic direction in a timely manner in order to assist all to be “completely united...in the same line of thought.” (1 Cor. 1:10) To that end, we are pleased to make this publication available to you.
2. Although this book covers most aspects of our work as elders, at times you may need to consult other publications, such as Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will and letters from the branch office. Be alert to adjustments so as to stay up-to-date on theocratic direction. Ensure that you are using the latest version of this publication. Supplemental direction that applies specifically in your branch territory can be found in Addendum to “Shepherd the Flock of God”​—1 Peter 5:2. We encourage each elder to make appropriate notes in his personal copy of this book directing attention to Shepherd Addendum.
3. This publication is copyrighted and confidential. It is issued to each appointed elder. If an elder is deleted for reasons other than moving to another congregation with a favorable recommendation, he should turn over this publication to the Congregation Service Committee to be destroyed, and any electronic copies in his possession should be deleted.
4. We pray that this publication will prove to be a valuable resource in assisting you to imitate Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in the way you treat the sheep. (John 10:11; Eph. 5:1; 1 Pet. 2:21, 25; 5:4) Rather than making rigid rules for the congregation, rely on Scriptural principles and direction from Jehovah’s organization.​—2 Cor. 1:24.

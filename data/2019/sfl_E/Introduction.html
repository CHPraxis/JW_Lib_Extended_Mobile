<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>1. </strong>As an appointed elder, you have the serious responsibility to “shepherd the flock of God under your care.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:2, 3</a>) Providing accurate theocratic direction to our brothers and sisters is a weighty responsibility. It is important that elders locate Scriptural and theocratic direction in a timely manner in order to assist all to be “completely united...in the same line of thought.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10</a>) To that end, we are pleased to make this publication available to you.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>2. </strong>Although this book covers most aspects of our work as elders, at times you may need to consult other publications, such as <em>Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will </em>and letters from the branch office. Be alert to adjustments so as to stay up-to-date on theocratic direction. Ensure that you are using the latest version of this publication. Supplemental direction that applies specifically in your branch territory can be found in <em>Addendum to “Shepherd the Flock of God”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>1 Peter 5:2</em></a><em>. </em>We encourage each elder to make appropriate notes in his personal copy of this book directing attention to <em>Shepherd Addendum.</em></p>

If an elder is deleted for reasons other than moving to another congregation with a favorable recommendation, he should turn over this publication to the Congregation Service Committee to be destroyed, and any electronic copies in his possession should be deleted.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>4. </strong>We pray that this publication will prove to be a valuable resource in assisting you to imitate Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in the way you treat the sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 10:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:25-60:2:25" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:4-60:5:4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 5:4</a>) Rather than making rigid rules for the congregation, rely on Scriptural principles and direction from Jehovah’s organization.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:24-47:1:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:24</a>.</p>

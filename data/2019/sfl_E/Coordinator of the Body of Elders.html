<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>1. </strong>The circuit overseer is responsible for the appointment of the coordinator of the body of elders, taking into consideration the recommendation of the body of elders. If an adjustment is needed, this appointment will be made during his regular visit to the congregation. The body of elders may assign another elder to assist the coordinator of the body of elders. If a temporary adjustment is made by the body of elders apart from the circuit overseer’s visit, the Congregation Service Committee should immediately notify the circuit overseer, explaining the reason for the change. Whether the change in the coordinator of the body of elders is permanent or temporary, a <em>Coordinator of the Body of Elders/​Secretary Change of Address </em>(S-29) form should be submitted to the Service Department. If the coordinator of the body of elders will be away temporarily, the body of elders may select another elder to substitute for him.</p>

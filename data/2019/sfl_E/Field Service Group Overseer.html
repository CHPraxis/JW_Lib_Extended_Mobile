(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 13:15-17</a>) In view of the importance of this assignment, the body of elders should select those elders most qualified to fulfill all the aspects of this assignment. If there are not enough elders in the congregation who are able to serve as group overseers or group assistants, ministerial servants may be assigned as group servants or group assistants. If there are not enough ministerial servants, a baptized brother who is a good example may serve as the group assistant. The other elders and ministerial servants in each group should be alert to support the group overseer and his assistant in caring for these responsibilities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:15-49:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 4:15, 16</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014935/38-43"><em>od </em>pp. 39-41 pars. 29-34</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p38" data-pid="38"><strong>ELDERS’ MEETINGS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><strong>3. </strong>When the body of elders discusses a matter, Christ by means of the holy spirit can influence any elder to make an expression that contributes to a wise decision, one that may not have been reached if the elders had been consulted individually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:6-44:15:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 15:6-21</a>) Meetings should normally not exceed two hours in length.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><strong>4. When to Hold: </strong>In addition to the elders’ meeting held during each visit of the circuit overseer, an elders’ meeting should be held about three months after each visit. Other meetings can be arranged any time that circumstances necessitate.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><strong>5. What to Discuss: </strong>The body of elders may discuss any matters pertaining to the congregation. Generally, these would involve matters that cannot be handled by individual elders or that are not the responsibility of another entity, such as the Congregation Service Committee or the Kingdom Hall Operating Committee.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018115/3-3">See 2:1</a>; <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018116/15-15">3:3.4</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><strong>6. </strong>Following are some matters that periodically merit the attention of the body of elders:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(1) </span>At the meeting held about three months after the visit of the circuit overseer, review the circuit overseer’s report on his previous visit to the congregation. In preparation for the next visit of the circuit overseer, consider any recommendations for the appointment or deletion of elders or ministerial servants.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018121/">See Chapter 8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(2) </span>Consider whether and how the congregation can do more to give a thorough witness in the congregation’s assigned territory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>; <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018136/">see Chapter 23</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(3) </span>Consider the spiritual and physical needs of widows, orphans, the blind, the homebound, those in nursing homes, and other publishers with special circumstances.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(4) </span>Consider what further training is needed to help brothers care properly for congregation assignments and to help those with potential, including newly baptized and younger brothers, to take on greater responsibility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:2</a>; <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018138/25-27">see 25:4-6</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sw"><span class="txtSrcBullet">(5) </span>Review the congregation assignments of all exemplary, baptized brothers. For example, is there a need to balance out the workload of the appointed brothers or to adjust the assignments so as to provide newer brothers with the opportunity to gain additional experience?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:17-2:18:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 18:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:2-20:11:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Prov. 11:2b</a>; <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018114/25-25">see 1:2.8</a>.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb"><strong>7. Compiling and Distributing the Agenda: </strong>For the meeting that is held about three months after the visit of the circuit overseer, the coordinator of the body of elders should ask the other elders to submit matters that they would like to discuss. The elders should be invited to suggest the names of brothers they would like to consider for recommendation as elders or ministerial servants. (<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018121/1">See Chapter 8</a>.) The coordinator of the body of elders should give a copy of the agenda to each elder a few days before the meeting to allow time for research and prayerful consideration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) For the meeting that is held during the visit of the circuit overseer, the circuit overseer compiles the agenda after checking whether the elders have additional points they wish to discuss. If time permits, the circuit overseer may agree to include one or two significant items on the agenda. Otherwise, he will direct the elders to consider those matters at another time.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb"><strong>8. During the Meeting: </strong>The coordinator of the body of elders should set the pace of the discussion by sticking to the agenda as much as possible and by keeping the main points to the fore. The secretary or another designated elder should take notes of the decisions, including the names of elders who will follow through and the suggested date for completion. In some cases the coordinator of the body of elders may ask the elder recommending an item for the agenda to take the lead in presenting it for discussion.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb"><strong>9. </strong>Each elder should freely express himself if he believes he has something meaningful to add. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19</a>) He should keep his comments succinct and relevant. The coordinator of the body of elders should avoid dominating the discussion, being careful as to when and how he expresses himself. There should be no anger or debates during elders’ meetings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:8-54:2:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb"><strong>10. </strong>It should be possible for bodies of elders to be unanimous in most of their decisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:25-44:15:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 15:25</a>) The body of elders should always base their decisions on Bible principles and written direction from “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) In cases that do not involve specific Bible laws or where there is no direction from the faithful slave, the body of elders must exercise their collective judgment and conscience. If a matter requires assistance from the branch office, it is usually best to write. If the matter is urgent, two elders together should call to explain the situation and to make a note of the direction given.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018127/22-66">See 14:6-30;</a><a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102018142/11-16"> 29:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb"><strong>11. </strong>No one should insist on his personal viewpoint. If a decision is not unanimous, the minority should give willing support to the final decision. If in the opinion of the minority a Bible-based decision still has not been reached, the minority should continue to cooperate with the rest of the body and should bring the matter to the attention of the circuit overseer during his regular visit.</p>

<h2 id="p54" data-pid="54"><strong>PURSUE PEACE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><strong>12. </strong>If the imperfections of those serving on the body are allowed to cause strained relations, the flow of Jehovah’s spirit can be restricted and the congregation may be adversely affected. Work hard to pursue peace with your fellow elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rom. 14:19</a>) Cultivate and maintain friendships with one another. At the same time, you should not hold back from giving fellow elders loving counsel when needed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:5-19:141:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb"><strong>13. </strong>Take the lead in showing honor to your fellow elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10</a>) One way you can do this is by keeping communication open and free, especially if there are differences in background. Younger elders should be respectful of older, more experienced elders on the body and demonstrate patience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:32-3:19:32" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lev. 19:32</a>) Older elders should not take offense when younger elders give suggestions or respectfully offer counsel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:9</a>) Humility will enable you to accept counsel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:15-20:12:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 12:15</a>) Even if you feel the counsel was not entirely justified, try to learn from it. Remember that the peace and well-being of the congregation is more important than personal interests.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:23-46:10:24" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:23, 24</a>.</p>

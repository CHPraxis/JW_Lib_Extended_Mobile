It is a haven for pedophiles, bullies, trolls and hackers,” says the newspaper <em>The Australian. </em>“Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the world. . . . The internet provides another outlet for one of the worst traits of humankind​—the capacity to be vicious and cruel.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>FINANCIAL INEQUALITY: </strong>According to a recent Oxfam International report, the eight richest people own the same amount of wealth as the poorer half of humanity. “Our broken economies,” said Oxfam, “are funnelling wealth to a rich elite at the expense of the poorest in society, the majority of whom are women.” Some fear that the growing inequality might trigger social unrest.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT: </strong>“Biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates,” states <em>The Global Risks Report 2018, </em>and “pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.” Also, insect numbers are in steep decline in some lands. Because insects pollinate plants, scientists are now warning of a potential “ecological Armageddon.” Coral reefs are in trouble too. Scientists estimate that about half the world’s reefs have died in the past 30 years.</p>

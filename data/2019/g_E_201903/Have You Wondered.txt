Have You Wondered?









  If God cares about us, why has he allowed evil and suffering to go on for so long?

  How can we be sure that we are living in the last days of the present world?

  How do we know that the Bible’s promises about God’s Kingdom will come true?

  Can the Bible help us make wise decisions in life now?


Because our Creator loves us, he has provided answers to those questions and many others. To help you find those answers, go to our website, www.jw.org, which is dedicated to Bible education.
On that website, you will find activities, articles, audio and video recordings, interviews, and a broad variety of publications, including the Bible. All are free of charge with no obligation.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong> How can the apostle Paul’s example help elders today?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">THE apostle Paul loved his brothers. He worked tirelessly in their behalf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:31-44:20:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:31</a>) In turn, his fellow believers had deep affection for Paul. On one occasion, “quite a bit of weeping broke out” when the elders from Ephesus learned that they would never see him again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:37-44:20:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:37</a>) Our devoted elders likewise love their brothers and sisters very much and spare no effort when it comes to helping them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:16-50:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 2:16, 17</a>) Sometimes, however, elders experience challenges. What can help them to overcome these?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Our hardworking elders can consider the example of Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:1</a>) He was not superhuman. Paul was an imperfect man who at times struggled to do what was right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:18-45:7:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 7:18-20</a>) And he had to contend with various hardships. But Paul did not give up or lose his joy. By imitating Paul, elders can overcome the challenges they face and maintain their joy while serving Jehovah. Let us see how.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What will we examine in this article, and what will we be helped to do?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> In this article, we will examine four common challenges that elders face: (1) balancing their preaching work with other responsibilities, (2) being caring shepherds, (3) coping with personal weaknesses, and (4) dealing with the imperfections of others. We will discuss how Paul overcame each challenge and how elders can imitate his example.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> Why might elders find it challenging to take the lead in the preaching work?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4</sup> <em>Why it can be a challenge.</em></strong> Elders have many responsibilities in addition to taking the lead in the preaching work. For example, many take turns presiding over the midweek meeting and conducting the Congregation Bible Study. They may also care for other speaking assignments. They are active in training ministerial servants and are happy to provide ongoing encouragement to the brothers and sisters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:2</a>) Some elders work on the building and maintenance of Kingdom Halls and other theocratic facilities. Still, like all in the congregation, an elder is first and foremost a minister of the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What example did Paul set as a preacher?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5</sup> <em>Paul’s example.</em></strong> The key to Paul’s success is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>, where he urges us: “Make sure of the more important things.” Paul followed his own advice. He had been assigned a ministry, and for decades he viewed that ministry as one of the more important things. He preached “publicly and from house to house.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>) He did not limit his preaching activity to a certain time of day or to one day of the week. He took advantage of every opportunity to preach! For example, while waiting for his companions in Athens, he introduced the good news to a distinguished group of people, with some positive results. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:16-44:17:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 17:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:34-44:17:34" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 34</a>) Even while in “prison bonds,” Paul preached to those who were around him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:13-50:1:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Phil. 1:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:24" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 28:16-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What training did Paul provide?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Paul made the best use of his time. He often invited others to join him in the ministry. For example, on his first missionary tour, he took John Mark, and on his second, Timothy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:25-44:12:25" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 12:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:1-44:16:4" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16:1-4</a>) No doubt Paul endeavored to teach these men how to organize a congregation, how to carry out the shepherding work, and how to become effective teachers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:17-46:4:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How can elders follow Paul’s admonition recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:14-49:6:15" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:14, 15</a>?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7</sup> <em>Lesson.</em></strong> Elders can imitate Paul not only by preaching from door to door but also by being ready and willing to give a witness on every occasion. <strong>(Read</strong> <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:14-49:6:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 6:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> For example, they can give a witness when out shopping or at their place of employment. Or when caring for theocratic building projects, they can share the good news with neighbors and vendors. Like Paul, elders can use the time spent in the ministry to train others, including ministerial servants.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> At times, what may an elder need to do?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Elders should never be so busy caring for assignments in the congregation or in the circuit that they have no time for the preaching work. To remain balanced, they may on occasion need to say no to some assignments. After prayerful consideration, they may realize that they could not care for an assignment without neglecting the more important things. Such things would include conducting family worship each week, having a full share in the preaching work, or training their children in that activity. Some find it difficult to refuse a privilege of service, but they can be sure that Jehovah understands their desire to be balanced in all things.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9</sup> <em>Why it can be a challenge.</em></strong> Jehovah’s people experience many trials. During these last days, all of us need encouragement, support, and comfort. And at times some need help to avoid wrong conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) Of course, elders cannot remove all the trials that Jehovah’s people face. Even so, Jehovah wants elders to do what they can to encourage and protect his sheep. How can busy elders find the time to provide the needed assistance?</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10</sup> <em>Paul’s example.</em></strong> Paul looked for ways to commend his brothers and build them up. Elders do well to follow his loving example by treating Jehovah’s people with tender affection. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:7-52:2:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 2:7</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Paul assured fellow worshippers that he loved them and that Jehovah loved them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:4-47:2:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:5" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:4, 5</a>) Paul treated those in the congregation as friends, spending time with them. He showed that he trusted them by speaking openly about his own fears and weaknesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:5-47:7:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:15-54:1:15" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:15</a>) Paul, however, did not focus on his own problems. Rather, he wanted to help his brothers.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> Why did Paul counsel his brothers and sisters?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> At times, Paul needed to counsel his brothers and sisters. But he never did so to vent his frustration. He gave counsel <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>because he cared about them and wanted to protect them from various dangers. He tried to make his counsel easy to understand, and he cared about how it was received. For example, in a letter to the Corinthians, Paul gave strong counsel. After writing that letter, he sent Titus to them. Paul was anxious to learn how they responded to his letter. How happy he was to find out that they had taken the counsel well!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:6-47:7:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong> How can elders strengthen fellow worshippers?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12</sup> <em>Lesson.</em></strong> Elders can follow Paul’s example by spending time with fellow worshippers. One way to do this is to arrive early at congregation meetings in order to have meaningful conversations with others. It often takes just a few minutes to provide some loving encouragement that a brother or a sister needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:12-45:1:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:16</a>) An elder who follows Paul’s example will also strengthen fellow worshippers by using God’s Word to build them up and to assure them of God’s love for them. Further, he expresses his love for those under his care. He keeps in touch with them and looks for opportunities to commend them. When an elder must offer counsel, he bases it on God’s Word. He is specific but kind because he cares about how his words are received.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14</sup> <em>Paul’s example.</em></strong> Paul humbly recognized that he could not cope with his weaknesses on his own.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:12-16</a>) With Jehovah’s help, Paul became a loving, compassionate, humble shepherd.

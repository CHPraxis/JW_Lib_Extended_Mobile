We Can Conquer Hatred!

Have you been the victim of hatred?




If not, you have likely observed it in one form or another. The news is filled with reports of racism, homophobia, and xenophobia​—expressions of hatred based on race, sexuality, or nationality. As a result, many governments are passing laws against various hate crimes.
Hatred easily leads to more hatred. Victims of hatred often retaliate with revenge and fuel an ongoing cycle of hatred.

This magazine will address the following questions and show how hatred can be conquered:
  Why is there so much hatred?

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Face Economic Hardship With Confidence




Life in the last days is full of challenges. As we near the end of this system of things, difficulties will certainly increase. We may face shortages of one sort or another. (Hab 3:16-18) What will help us to face economic hardship with confidence? We must continue to trust our God, Jehovah. He has promised to care for his servants, and he can provide for us in any circumstance.​—Ps 37:18, 19; Heb 13:5, 6.
What you can do:
  Beg Jehovah for guidance, wisdom, and his support.​—Ps 62:8

  Be willing to accept work that you may not have done before.​—g 1/10 8-9, boxes

  Maintain a good spiritual routine, including reading God’s Word daily, attending congregation meetings, and participating in the ministry

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Helpful Features of Enjoy Life Forever!




Do you appreciate the videos and viewpoint questions in the Enjoy Life Forever! book? How about the features “Some People Say,” “Goal,” and “Explore”? What other features might you find helpful as you participate in the disciple-making work?​—Mt 28:19, 20.





Media: If you prefer to conduct a Bible study using a printed book, how can you easily access all of the videos and other media in one place? In the digital book, select one of the four main sections. At the bottom of the list of lesson titles, you can select all the media for that particular section. (See picture 1.)
“Printed Edition” setting: If you are studying with someone from an electronic device, you may find it helpful to use the “Printed Edition” setting at various times during the study. While in the lesson, tap on the three dots in the toolbar at the top of the page and select “Printed Edition.” This layout may help you to keep clearly in mind how the material you are discussing relates to the overall theme of the lesson. To return to the digital edition, tap the three dots again and select “Digital Edition.”





“Am I Ready?”: These boxes near the end of the book outline the basic qualifications for preaching with the congregation and getting baptized. (See picture 2.)
Endnotes: Endnotes provide explanatory material regarding certain important subjects. The digital book includes a link at the end of each endnote that will take you back to where you left off in the lesson. (See picture 2.)



Be sure to study Enjoy Life Forever! to completion with progressive Bible students, even if they get baptized before you finish. You may continue to count the time, the return visits, and the study even after the student is baptized. If a publisher accompanies you and participates in the study, he too may count the time

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Imitate How Jehovah Exercises Authority




Jehovah has supreme authority (1Ki 22:19; it-2 21)
Jehovah honors those subject to him (1Ki 22:20-22; w21.02 4 ¶9)
Jehovah blessed the work of an angel (1Ki 22:23; it-2 245)





Especially must elders and family heads try to imitate the way that Jehovah wields authority. (Eph 6:4; 1Pe 3:7; 5:2, 3) When they do so, those under their authority will be happy and content.

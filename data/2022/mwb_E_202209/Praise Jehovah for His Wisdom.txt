TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Praise Jehovah for His Wisdom




Jehovah gave Solomon extraordinary wisdom (1Ki 10:1-3; w99 7/1 30 ¶6)
The queen of Sheba was astounded by the wisdom Jehovah gave Solomon (1Ki 10:4, 5; w99 11/1 20 ¶6)
The queen of Sheba praised Jehovah for appointing Solomon as king (1Ki 10:6-9; w99 7/1 30-31)





Like the queen of Sheba, we can show appreciation for God-given wisdom. How? One way is by applying Jesus’ teachings in our life and doing our best to imitate his example. (Mt 12:42; 1Pe 2:21) Another way is to share godly wisdom with others in our ministry.

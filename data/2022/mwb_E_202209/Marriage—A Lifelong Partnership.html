<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Successful Christian marriages honor Jehovah and bring joy to a husband and wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:9-41:10:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mr 10:9</a>) To have an enduring, happy marriage, Christians must stick closely to Bible principles when choosing a mate.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Pursue a courtship only after you are “past the bloom of youth,” a time when strong sexual feelings can distort your judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Co 7:36</a>) Make wise use of your years of singleness to strengthen your relationship with God and to develop Christian qualities. Then, you will be in a far better position to contribute to a successful marriage.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Before agreeing to marry someone, take the necessary time to get to know “the secret person of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Pe 3:4</a>) If serious doubts arise, discuss them with your potential mate. As with other human relationships, marriage should be more about what you give than what you get. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Php 2:3, 4</a>) If you apply Bible principles before marriage, you will be laying a fine foundation for a happy married life.</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Until the Resurrection Becomes Reality




When a loved one dies, we find comfort in the resurrection hope. Even so, sin and death are like a suffocating shroud that weighs heavily on all of us. (Isa 25:7, 8) This is one reason why “all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together.” (Ro 8:22) How can we cope with the loss of loved ones until the resurrection becomes reality? God’s Word contains principles that can help us.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Marriage​—A Lifelong Partnership




Successful Christian marriages honor Jehovah and bring joy to a husband and wife. (Mr 10:9) To have an enduring, happy marriage, Christians must stick closely to Bible principles when choosing a mate.
Pursue a courtship only after you are “past the bloom of youth,” a time when strong sexual feelings can distort your judgment. (1Co 7:36) Make wise use of your years of singleness to strengthen your relationship with God and to develop Christian qualities. Then, you will be in a far better position to contribute to a successful marriage.
Before agreeing to marry someone, take the necessary time to get to know “the secret person of the heart.” (1Pe 3:4) If serious doubts arise, discuss them with your potential mate. As with other human relationships, marriage should be more about what you give than what you get. (Php 2:3, 4) If you apply Bible principles before marriage, you will be laying a fine foundation for a happy married life.

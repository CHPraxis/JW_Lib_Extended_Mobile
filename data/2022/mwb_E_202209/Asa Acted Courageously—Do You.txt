TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Asa Acted Courageously​—Do You?




Asa zealously defended pure worship (1Ki 15:11, 12; w12 8/15 8 ¶4)
Asa courageously put his worship ahead of family ties (1Ki 15:13; w17.03 19 ¶7)
Asa’s good qualities evidently outweighed his mistakes (1Ki 15:14, 23; it-1 184-185)





ASK YOURSELF: ‘Do I show zeal for pure worship? Do I stop associating with anyone, including a family member, who turns his back on Jehovah?’​—2Jo 9, 10.

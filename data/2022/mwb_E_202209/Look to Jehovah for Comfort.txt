Look to Jehovah for Comfort




Elijah became afraid and ran for his life (1Ki 19:3, 4; w19.06 15 ¶5)
Jehovah gave him practical assistance and showed him awe-inspiring displays of power (1Ki 19:5-7, 11, 12; ia 103 ¶13; 106 ¶21)
Jehovah gave him work to do (1Ki 19:15-18; ia 106 ¶22)





Jehovah speaks to us today through the pages of his Word, reminding us that he truly cares for us and that he gives us meaningful work to do in his service.​—1Co 15:58; Col 3:23.

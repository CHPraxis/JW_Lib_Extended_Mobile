TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Why Be Content and Modest?




God’s prophet refused Jeroboam’s lavish gifts (1Ki 13:7-10; w08 8/15 8 ¶4)
God’s prophet later disobeyed Jehovah’s direct command (1Ki 13:14-19; w08 8/15 11 ¶15)
The prophet’s disobedience led to disaster (1Ki 13:20-22; w08 8/15 9 ¶10)





If we are content and look to Jehovah when making decisions, we can avoid many unforeseen problems.​—1Ti 6:8-10.
ASK YOURSELF: ‘How can I show that I am content with the necessities of life? How can I show modesty when making decisions?’​—Pr 3:5; 11:2.

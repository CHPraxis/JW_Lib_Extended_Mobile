TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
A Fine Example of Training




[Play the video Introduction to 2 Kings.]
Elisha watched as Elijah performed a miracle (2Ki 2:8; w15 4/15 13 ¶15; see cover picture)
Elisha humbly used the fine training he received (2Ki 2:13, 14; w15 4/15 13 ¶16)





In the congregation, Jehovah entrusts the elders with the responsibility of training others. (2Ti 2:2) If the elders offer you training, be willing, reliable, and humble.

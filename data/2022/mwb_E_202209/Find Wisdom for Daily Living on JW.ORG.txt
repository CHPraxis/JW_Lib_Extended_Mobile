LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Find Wisdom for Daily Living on JW.ORG




God’s Word completely equips us to cope with trials in these difficult last days. (2Ti 3:1, 16, 17) Still, we may at times need help to find Bible principles that apply to a specific situation. For example, are you a parent seeking advice on raising children? Are you a teenager coping with challenges to your faith? Are you a widow or widower grieving the death of a mate? You will find material on jw.org that will direct you to specific Bible principles to help you in these and many other situations.​—Pr 2:3-6.





On the jw.org home page, select the BIBLE TEACHINGS tab. (See picture 1.) From the drop-down list, select your category of choice. Or select LIBRARY > ARTICLE SERIES and your category of choice. (See picture 2.) You can find the same categories in JW Library®.a You might enjoy just browsing the articles in either of these locations. Another option is to find a specific topic using the search feature on jw.org.





Type the following topics in the search box, and make a note of articles that you would like to read.
  Raising children

  Teenage depression

  Death of a mate





For some series, a complete set of articles currently appears only on jw.org.

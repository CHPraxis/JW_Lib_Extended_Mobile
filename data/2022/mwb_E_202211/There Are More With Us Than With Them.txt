Elisha telling his attendant: “There are more who are with us than those who are with them.”​—2Ki 6:16



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
There Are More With Us Than With Them




Elisha and his attendant were surrounded by the enemy (2Ki 6:13, 14; it-1 716 ¶4)
Elisha remained calm and strengthened his attendant (2Ki 6:15-17; w13 8/15 30 ¶2; see cover picture)
Jehovah miraculously saved Elisha and his attendant (2Ki 6:18, 19; it-1 343 ¶1)





Our opposers are not stronger than Jehovah. If we could peer into the spirit realm and see how Jehovah is using the angels to protect his people, what do you imagine we would see?

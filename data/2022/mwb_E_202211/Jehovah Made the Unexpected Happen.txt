TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Made the Unexpected Happen




During a severe famine, Jehovah said that food supplies would be abundant the next day (2Ki 7:1; it-1 716-717)
An Israelite official scoffed at Jehovah’s promise (2Ki 7:2)
Jehovah made the unexpected happen (2Ki 7:6, 7, 16-18)





Jehovah says that the destruction of this system will be sudden and unexpected. (1Th 5:2, 3) Why is it important for us to have faith in Jehovah’s word?

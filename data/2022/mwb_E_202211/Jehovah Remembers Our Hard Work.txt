Jehovah Remembers Our Hard Work




At times, we may feel that our hard work in behalf of others is unappreciated and quickly forgotten. What about our work for Jehovah? Our appreciative God never forgets our wholehearted efforts to serve him. Even when declining health limits what we can do, he will not abandon us.​—Heb 6:10.
WATCH THE VIDEO JEHOVAH REMEMBERS, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:

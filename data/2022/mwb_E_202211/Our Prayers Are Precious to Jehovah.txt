LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Our Prayers Are Precious to Jehovah




Acceptable prayers are like the sweet-smelling incense that was regularly burned before Jehovah at the temple. (Ps 141:2) When we express to our heavenly Father our love and appreciation for him, tell him our concerns and desires, and ask for his direction, we show that we value our friendship with him. Of course, Jehovah views brief public prayers at our meetings as an important part of our worship. However, how it must bring Jehovah pleasure when in our personal prayers we open our hearts and talk to him for extended periods of time!​—Pr 15:8.

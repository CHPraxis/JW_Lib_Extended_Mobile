TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Wholehearted Effort Results in Abundant Blessings




Elisha instructed King Jehoash to take a certain action to illustrate how Israel would defeat Syria (2Ki 13:15-18)
Because Jehoash was not wholehearted, his success was limited (2Ki 13:19; w10 4/15 26 ¶11)
Jehovah abundantly blesses his servants who seek him earnestly (Heb 11:6; w13 11/1 11 ¶5-6)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How do I demonstrate wholehearted effort in such aspects of my worship as Bible reading, meeting attendance, and the field ministry?’

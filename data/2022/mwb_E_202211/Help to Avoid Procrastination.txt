LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Help to Avoid Procrastination




A procrastinator postpones what he could or should do right away. That certainly does not describe Jehu when Jehovah gave him the assignment to strike down the house of Ahab. (2Ki 9:6, 7, 16) Some people say: “Maybe I’ll get baptized in a couple of years.” “I hope to start a routine of daily Bible reading very soon.” “I’ll apply to pioneer once I get a better job.” The Scriptures can help us to avoid procrastination in areas of our worship.
How can the following verses motivate us to avoid procrastination?
  Ec 5:4

  Ec 11:4

  1Co 7:29-31

  Jas 4:13, 14

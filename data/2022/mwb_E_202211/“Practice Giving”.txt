LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Practice Giving”




Jesus indicated that generosity is contagious. (Lu 6:38) Your practice of giving motivates your brothers and sisters to be kind and generous.
Cheerful giving is part of our worship. Jehovah takes note of those who generously show favor to fellow Christians in need of assistance and promises to reward them.​—Pr 19:17.

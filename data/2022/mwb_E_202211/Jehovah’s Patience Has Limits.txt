TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah’s Patience Has Limits




Jehovah allowed Assyria to conquer Israel (2Ki 17:5, 6; it-2 908 ¶5)
Jehovah disciplined his people because they kept offending him (2Ki 17:9-12; it-1 414-415)
Jehovah was patient with Israel and warned them repeatedly (2Ki 17:13, 14)
Our loving heavenly Father is very patient with imperfect mankind. (2Pe 3:9) However, in order to accomplish his purpose, he will act to destroy the wicked very soon. How should this motivate us to listen to correction and to preach with urgency?

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jehovah has proved that he is eager to forgive. He understands that because of the actions of the first man, Adam, we all came under the curse of sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) There was no way for us to free ourselves or any other person from that curse.

As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:16</a> reveals, Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to die in our behalf.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What are some Bible examples of individuals whom Jehovah freely forgave?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The Bible is filled with examples of individuals whom Jehovah freely forgave. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32</a>) Who comes to your mind? Perhaps you think of King Manasseh. That wicked man sinned against <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jehovah in terrible ways. He took the lead in false worship. He killed his own children, offering them as sacrifices to pagan gods. He even went so far as to place a carved image of a false god in Jehovah’s sacred temple. Of him, the Bible says: “He did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, to offend him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:2-14:33:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:2-7</a>) Yet, when Manasseh showed heartfelt repentance, Jehovah freely forgave him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:12-14:33:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>) Perhaps you also think of King David, who committed serious sins against Jehovah, including adultery and murder. Yet, when David sincerely repented and acknowledged his error, Jehovah forgave him as well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:9-10:12:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:13-10:12:14" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) Yes, we can be certain that Jehovah is eager to forgive.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How does Jehovah’s unique position as Judge affect his ability to forgive?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is “the Judge of all the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 18:25</a>) A good judge needs to have a deep understanding of the law. That certainly is true of Jehovah because in addition to being our Judge, he is also our Lawgiver. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>) No one besides Jehovah has such a deep and strong sense of right and wrong. What else does a good judge need? He needs to be able to consider all the relevant facts in a case before he renders judgment. In this respect, Jehovah is uniquely qualified as Judge.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What information does Jehovah have available when deciding whether to forgive?</p>

He completely understands how a person’s actions are influenced by his genetic makeup, upbringing, and environment as well as by his emotional and mental condition. Jehovah also reads the heart. He fully perceives the motivations, intentions, and desires of each person. Nothing can be hidden from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>) Thus, Jehovah’s forgiveness is always based on his complete knowledge of a situation.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> As we have seen, Jehovah’s decision to forgive is not based on whether the sin was great or small.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> One factor that Jehovah considers is whether the sinner knew that what he was doing was wrong.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Another factor that Jehovah considers is whether the sinner is sincerely repentant. What does it mean to repent? To repent means “to change one’s mind, attitude, or purpose.” It includes the idea that a person feels regret and deep sadness about the bad things he has done or about not doing the right things he should have done. A repentant person is grieved not only by the wrongs he has committed but also by the poor spiritual condition that led to those wrongs. Recall that Kings Manasseh and David both committed serious sins; yet, Jehovah forgave them because they were sincerely repentant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:8-11:14:8" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:8</a>) Yes, Jehovah must see evidence of repentance in order to forgive.

We must be ready to take action.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> That brings us to another factor that Jehovah considers.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Conversion is another important factor that Jehovah considers. Conversion means “a turning around.” In other words, a person must change course by leaving his bad way and pursuing the way of Jehovah. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 55:7</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The individual must transform his mind so that he is guided by the thinking of Jehovah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:7-51:3:10" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Col. 3:7-10</a>) Of course, it is our faith in the sacrifice of Christ that provides the real basis for Jehovah to forgive us and cleanse us <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>from sin.

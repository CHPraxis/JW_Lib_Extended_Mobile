<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> (a) When a servant of Jehovah commits a serious sin, what must he do? (b) What is the role of the elders when they meet with a wrongdoer?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Serious sins must be brought to the attention of the elders. Examples of such sins are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>. Serious sins are gross violations of God’s law. If a Christian commits such a sin, he must approach Jehovah God in prayer, and he must go to the elders of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:5-19:32:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 32:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:14</a>) What role do the elders play? Only Jehovah has the authority to forgive sins fully, which he makes possible on the basis of the ransom sacrifice.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Jehovah, however, has entrusted the elders with the responsibility of determining from the Scriptures whether the sinner can remain in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:12-46:5:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:12</a>) Among other things, they will endeavor to answer the following questions: Was the sin intentional? Did the person scheme to do what was wrong? Did he practice the sin over an extended period of time? Most important, is there evidence that he is sincerely repentant? Are there indications that Jehovah has forgiven him?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What blessings come from the work of the elders?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> When the elders meet with the wrongdoer, their goal is to reach the same decision on earth that has already been reached in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:18-40:18:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 18:18</a>) How does this arrangement benefit the congregation? It ensures that unrepentant wrongdoers who might harm Jehovah’s precious sheep are removed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:6-46:5:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:13" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:10-56:3:11" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Titus 3:10, 11</a>) It may also help a sinner to repent and benefit from Jehovah’s forgiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:32-42:5:32" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 5:32</a>) The elders pray in behalf of a repentant one and ask Jehovah to help him recover spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:15-59:5:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 5:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> If a person is disfellowshipped, is forgiveness still possible? Explain.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Suppose that a person is not repentant when the elders meet with him. In that case, he will be disfellowshipped from the congregation. If he has violated the law of the land, the elders will not shield him from the consequences. Jehovah allows governmental authorities to judge and punish <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> who violates the law​—whether he is repentant or not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:4-45:13:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rom. 13:4</a>) Yet, if the person later comes to his senses and sincerely repents and turns around, Jehovah is willing to pardon him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:17-42:15:24" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 15:17-24</a>) That is true even if his sins were very serious.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:9-14:33:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:12-14:33:13" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:15-54:1:15" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> In what sense can we forgive someone who has sinned against us?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> What a relief it is to know that we do not need to decide if Jehovah will pardon a sinner! Still, there is something that we do need to decide. What is it? In some cases, an individual has sinned against us​—even seriously—​but then he may apologize and ask for our forgiveness. In other cases, the person may not. Even so, we can choose to forgive the person in the sense that we can decide <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>to let go of any resentment and anger that we feel toward him. Realistically, this may take time and effort, especially if we have been deeply hurt. <em>The Watchtower</em> of September 15, 1994, says: “When you do forgive a sinner, this does not mean that you are condoning the sin. For the Christian, forgiveness means trustfully leaving the matter in Jehovah’s hands. He is the righteous Judge of all the universe, and he will carry out justice at the right time.” Why does Jehovah encourage us to forgive and to leave justice where it belongs​—in <strong><em>his</em></strong> hands?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How does being forgiving show appreciation for Jehovah’s mercy?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Being forgiving shows appreciation.</em></strong> In one parable, Jesus compared Jehovah to a master who canceled an enormous debt that one of his slaves could not repay. Yet, the forgiven slave failed to act mercifully toward a slave who owed him a much smaller amount of money. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:23-40:18:35" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 18:23-35</a>) What was Jesus teaching us? If we truly appreciate Jehovah’s great mercy toward us, we will be moved to forgive others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:9-19:103:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 103:9</a>) <em>The Watchtower</em> expressed it this way years ago: “No matter how many times we forgive our fellow creatures, it could never equal the extent of God’s forgiveness and mercy to us through Christ.”</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> To whom does Jehovah show mercy? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Forgivers will be forgiven.</em></strong> Jehovah shows mercy to those who are merciful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:7-40:5:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:13-59:2:13" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:13</a>) Jesus made that clear when he taught his disciples how to pray. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Earlier, Jehovah made the same point in connection with his servant Job. That faithful man had been deeply hurt by the cutting remarks of three men named Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Jehovah instructed Job to pray in their behalf. After Job did so, Jehovah blessed him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:8-18:42:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 42:8-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Harboring resentment is damaging.</em></strong> Jehovah wants us to enjoy the relief that comes from unburdening ourselves of resentment. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 4:31, 32</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He urges us to “let go of anger and abandon rage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>) There is wisdom in following that advice. Harboring resentment can be harmful to our physical and mental health. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Prov. 14:30</a>) Our harboring such resentment will not affect the offender any more than our drinking poison would harm the one who offended us. Rather, when we forgive others, we are giving ourselves a gift. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:17-20:11:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Prov. 11:17</a>) We find peace of mind and heart, and we are able to move ahead in our service to Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Vengeance belongs to Jehovah.</em></strong> Jehovah has not authorized us to seek revenge when someone sins against us. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:19-45:12:21" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 12:19-21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> With our limited and imperfect viewpoint, we are simply not in a position to judge matters correctly, as God can. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>) And, at times, we allow our emotions to interfere with our good judgment. Jehovah <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>inspired James to write: “Man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:20-59:1:20" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jas. 1:20</a>) We can be certain that Jehovah will do the right thing and make sure that perfect justice will be carried out.</p>

At the time, Tony was a very aggressive and violent person, and he wanted revenge. José was arrested and imprisoned for his crime. Later, when José was released from prison, Tony vowed that he would hunt him down and kill him. He purchased a gun for that purpose. Meanwhile, Tony began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. He says, “As I was studying, I learned that I needed to change my ways, and that included letting go of my anger.” In time, Tony got baptized and was eventually appointed as a congregation elder. Imagine his surprise when he learned that José had also become a baptized <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>servant of Jehovah! When the two met, they warmly embraced each other, and Tony told José that he had forgiven him.

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p35" data-pid="35">Jehovah is eager to forgive repentant sinners. As Christians, we want to imitate his example when someone offends us. In this article, we will consider sins that we can personally forgive and sins that we must bring to the attention of the elders. We will also consider why Jehovah wants us to forgive one another and what blessings we will receive when we do so.</p></div>

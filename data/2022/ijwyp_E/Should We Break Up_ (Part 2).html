<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>First, choose a proper setting for the discussion. What could that be?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Well, think about how <em>you</em> would like to be treated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:​12</a>) Would you want the announcement to be made in front of others? Likely not.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Unless circumstances make it advisable, it would be best not to terminate a relationship by means of a telephone answering machine, a text message, or an e-mail. Instead, choose a time and place that will enable you to discuss this serious matter.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>What should you say when the time comes to speak up? The apostle Paul urged Christians to “speak truth” with one another.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:​25</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The best course, then, is to be tactful yet firm. State clearly why you feel that this relationship won’t work <em>for you.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>You don’t need to recite a laundry list of faults or let loose with a barrage of criticism. In fact, instead of saying, <em>“You</em> don’t do this” or <em>“You</em> never do that,” it would be better to use phrases that focus on how you feel​—<em>“I</em> need a person who . . .” or <em>“I</em> feel that this relationship should end because . . .”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>This is no time to be wishy-washy or to yield to another’s opinion. Remember, you have chosen to break up for a serious reason. So be cautious if your friend attempts to change your mind through subtle forms of manipulation. “After I ended the relationship,” says a young woman named Lori, “my ex-boyfriend started acting depressed all the time. I think he did it to make me feel sorry for him. I did feel bad. But I didn’t allow his reaction to alter my decision.” Like Lori, know your own mind. Stick to your decision. Let your <em>no</em> mean <em>no.</em>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:12-59:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 5:​12</a>.</p>

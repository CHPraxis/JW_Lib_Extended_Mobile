What if I Can’t Stand School?



Here’s what you need

A positive view of learning. Try to see the big picture. Not everything in your curriculum may seem relevant—at least not now. Still, an education in a variety of subjects will enrich your understanding of the world around you. It will help you to “become all things to people of all sorts,” giving you the ability to talk to people of various backgrounds. (1 Corinthians 9:22) At the very least, you will improve your thinking ability—a skill that will surely help you in the long run.




Getting through school can be like cutting your way through a dense jungle—but both are possible with the right tools



A positive view of your teacher. If you think your teacher is boring, focus on the topic, not the person. Remember, your teacher has likely taught the same lessons dozens or even hundreds of times to other classes. So it may be a challenge for him to maintain the level of enthusiasm that he first had for the subject.
Tip: Take notes, respectfully ask for more information, and be enthusiastic about the subject. Enthusiasm is contagious.
A positive view of your abilities. School can reveal your hidden talents. Paul wrote to Timothy: “Stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you.” (2 Timothy 1:6) Evidently, Timothy had been given some gift of the holy spirit. But his “gift” needed to be cultivated so that it would not lie dormant or go to waste. Of course, your scholastic abilities are not directly bestowed upon you by God. Nevertheless, the talents you have are unique to you. School can help you to discover and nurture abilities that you never knew you had.

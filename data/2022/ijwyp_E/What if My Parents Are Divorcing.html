<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>If your parents are unable to give you the support you need, you may be able to confide in a mature friend.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Don’t hold a grudge.</strong> “My parents were selfish,” says Daniel, whose parents split up when he was seven. “They didn’t really think about us and how what they did would affect us.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>What harm could come to Daniel if he refused to let go of his anger and resentment?—Clue: Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:22-20:29:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Avoid self-destructive behavior.</strong> “I was unhappy and depressed after my parents’ divorce,” recalls Denny. “I started having problems in school and failed one year.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>What, do you think, was Denny trying to accomplish by becoming the class clown or getting into fights?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>How might the principle at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a> help people like Denny avoid self-destructive behavior?</p>

YOUNG PEOPLE ASK
Am I Ready for Marriage?

Before you can answer that question, you need to know yourself well. For example, consider the following factors:
Relationships
How do you treat your parents and siblings? Do you often lose your self-control with them, perhaps using harsh or sarcastic language to make a point? What would they say about you in that regard? How you deal with family members indicates how you will treat a mate.​—Ephesians 4:31.
Demeanor
Are you positive or pessimistic? Are you reasonable, or do you always insist on doing things a certain way—your way? Can you keep calm when under pressure? Are you patient? Cultivating the fruitage of God’s spirit now will help you prepare for being a husband or a wife later.​—Galatians 5:22, 23.
Finances
How well do you handle money? Are you often in debt? Can you hold down a job? If not, why not? Is it because of the job? The employer? Or is it because of some habit or trait that you need to work on? If you have trouble handling your own finances, how will you manage those of a family?​—1 Timothy 5:8.
Spirituality
If you’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, what are your spiritual attributes? Do you take the initiative to read God’s Word, to engage in the ministry, and to participate at Christian meetings? The person you marry deserves nothing less than a spiritually strong partner.​—Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10.
The more you understand yourself, the better equipped you will be to find someone who will amplify your strengths rather than your weaknesses.

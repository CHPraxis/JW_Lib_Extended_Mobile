<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">UNDER the Law, both turtledoves and pigeons were acceptable as offerings to Jehovah. These two birds were always mentioned together in the laws about sacrifices and were interchangeable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:14-3:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:12:8-3:12:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:30-3:14:30" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 14:30</a>) Why was this beneficial? One reason was that turtledoves were not always readily available. Why not?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Turtledoves are migratory birds that live throughout the land of Israel during the warmer months. Each October, they migrate south to warmer countries, returning to Israel in the spring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:2:11-22:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 2:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:7-24:8:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer. 8:7</a>) In ancient Israel, this meant that it was difficult for the Israelites to offer turtledoves as a sacrifice during the wintertime.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the other hand, pigeons do not usually migrate, so they were available in Israel year-round. What is more, pigeons were domesticated. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:14-43:2:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 2:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:16-43:2:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16</a>.) According to the book <em>Bible Plants and Animals,</em> “all the villages and towns in Palestine had domesticated pigeons. Each homeowner had his dovecote, or hole in the wall, where the birds could live.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:8-23:60:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:8</a>.</p>

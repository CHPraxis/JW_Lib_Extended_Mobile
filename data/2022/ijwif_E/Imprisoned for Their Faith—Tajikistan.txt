Imprisoned for Their Faith—Tajikistan




In January and February 2019, officers of the Department of Organized Crime Control (DOCC) interrogated 24 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Khujand and nearby towns in northern Tajikistan. On September 10, 2019, the Khujand City Court sentenced 68-year-old Shamil Khakimov to seven and a half years in prison under the fabricated charge of ‘inciting religious hatred.’a Mr. Khakimov’s lengthy sentence was subsequently reduced, and he is scheduled to be released on May 16, 2023.




Shamil Khakimov



Mr. Khakimov is a widower and is in poor health, suffering from high blood pressure and other serious health conditions. His only child, a son, passed away in September 2021. In March 2021, Mr. Khakimov was transferred to a prison medical unit, where his health improved somewhat, but he has not received any professional medical care. Fellow believers are providing necessary food and medicine. Efforts are underway to locate a doctor in Tajikistan who is willing to treat him.



Efforts to Obtain Mr. Khakimov’s Release

In early 2021, Commissioner Nury Turkel of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom adopted Mr. Khakimov as a Religious Prisoner of Conscience and called for his immediate release. Most recently, on February 25, 2022, the third anniversary of Mr. Khakimov’s arrest, Mr. Turkel released the following statement:
“For three years, Khakimov has been forced to rot in prison because of his peaceful religious activity. Tajik authorities have refused to provide proper medical care for the open sores on Khakimov’s leg; they refused to allow him to attend the funeral of his son—his only allowed visitor in prison; and they have refused to let him share his faith or read his Bible in public. . . . The immense physical, mental, and spiritual suffering he continues to undergo must come to an end with his unconditional release.”

On March 15, 2021, Mr. Khakimov’s lawyers filed an urgent application with the UN Human Rights Committee (CCPR) and an urgent request for interim measures. The CCPR acted quickly, granting the request for interim measures just four days later. It requested that Tajikistan “ensure, without delay, that [Mr. Khakimov] receives adequate medical treatment in a specialized medical institution in accordance with his health care requirements, and that an alternative to imprisonment is secured for [Mr. Khakimov], while his case is pending before the [CCPR].” Mr. Khakimov filed supervisory appeals relying on the CCPR decision; however, all domestic courts, including the Supreme Court, have denied them.
In November 2021, Mr. Khakimov’s lawyers requested that the Khujand City Court grant a temporary release so he could receive necessary medical treatment, but the request was returned without any consideration. More recently, his lawyers filed a motion with the prison administration to release him based on his poor health condition and to replace the current punishment with a milder sentence. However, his sentence has not been reduced, and he remains in prison.

<h1 id="p1" data-pid="1"><strong>Imprisoned for Their Faith—Russia</strong></h1>
</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2">The history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in modern-day Russia is an account of oppression and persecution. For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Russian authorities have abused and mistreated the Witnesses, although they were known to be peaceful, law-abiding citizens. The aim of the government of the Soviet Union was to convert them, either by persuasion or by force to Soviet ideology. Thousands were exiled to Siberia. They were forbidden to possess Bibles or religious literature. They were under constant surveillance and had to hold their religious meetings in secret. If discovered, they were subjected to beatings and long prison sentences.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">That began to change in 1991 when the Russian government granted legal recognition to Jehovah’s Witnesses and allowed freedom of worship without interference from the authorities. However, the period of peace did not last long.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">In 2009, opposition and restrictions began to escalate when the Russian Supreme Court upheld a decision of a lower court to label a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses as “extremist.” After years of legal battles, in April 2017 the Russian Supreme Court ruled to liquidate the Witnesses’ legal entities for alleged extremist activity. Immediately the Russian authorities took steps to confiscate their property, close down their places of worship, and declare their religious literature to be “extremist material.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">Not stopping with their attack against the Witnesses’ legal entities, Russian authorities have chosen to target Jehovah’s Witnesses individually. Overreaching, they associate private worship of individual Witnesses with the banned organization. Police raids of the Witnesses’ homes bring abusive treatment and harsh interrogation. Both male and female Witnesses of all ages have been arrested, convicted, and sentenced to prison or house arrest.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6">Since the April 2017 ban, hundreds of Witnesses have been sentenced to pretrial detention or imprisonment under the charge of extremism. As of September 19, 2022, a total of 92 Witnesses are imprisoned.</p>
<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Outcries Against Russia’s Harsh Treatment of Jehovah’s Witnesses</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8">Russian authorities continue to convict Witnesses of extremist activity despite an international outcry for Russia to stop its relentless persecution. In fairness, a few Russian courts have boldly disagreed with applying the label of “extremists” to Jehovah’s Witnesses and have acquitted Witnesses charged under Article 282 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code regarding extremist activity. These court rulings are in harmony with a recent amended resolution of the Russian Supreme Court Plenum. In October 2021, this body clarified that worship carried on in a private setting should not be viewed as participation in the activities of a banned religious organization.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9">Informed observers and courts outside of Russia have condemned the Russian government for their relentless persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<div id="tt32" class="indent">
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights:</strong> “The harsh sentence imposed on [a Witness prisoner] creates a dangerous precedent, and effectively criminalises the right to freedom of religion or belief, for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia—in contravention of the State’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Statement from Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Permanent Council:</strong> “The European Union continues to be deeply concerned about the situation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia who continue to face systemic persecution, including home raids, arbitrary detentions, criminal investigations and sentences up to seven years of prison time. . . . We call upon the Russian Federation to live up to its international human rights commitments, to respect the freedoms of expression, association, peaceful assembly, religion or belief, as well as the rights of persons belonging to minorities and to guarantee a fair trial.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>European Court of Human Rights:</strong> On June 7, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights released a landmark judgment against Russia, condemning their persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses (<em>Taganrog LRO and Others v. Russia</em>, nos. 32401/10 and 19 others). The Court declared that it was unlawful for Russia to ban Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2017. Russia was ordered to “take all necessary measures to secure the discontinuation of all pending criminal proceedings against Jehovah’s Witnesses . . . and release . . . [imprisoned] Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Further, it was ordered to return all confiscated properties or pay over 60 million dollars in compensation and to pay the applicants over 3 million dollars in nonpecuniary damages.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>Shocking Incidents of Abuse and Imprisonment</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14">  In June 2018, law enforcement officers raided the home of 42-year-old Aleksey Berchuk and his wife. Aleksey was accused of organizing “extremist” activity, although in reality he was a circuit overseer, a full-time minister serving the spiritual needs of many fellow believers. On June 30, 2021, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, the longest prison sentence issued since the 2017 ban. Aleksey appealed the conviction, but on September 2, 2021, the Amur Regional Court upheld the verdict. He remains in Penal Colony No. 3 in the Republic of Mari El.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15">  On February 6, 2019, authorities in Saransk in the Russian republic of Mordovia raided the homes of Witness families and took several people into custody. They were accused of organizing and financing the activities of an extremist organization simply because they spoke about the Bible. At the criminal trial held on August 25, 2022, the six Witnesses (including a woman) received sentences ranging from two to six years in a penal colony. One of the men, Vladimir Atryakhin, is a father to two young children under six years of age. All six Witnesses were immediately taken into custody from the courtroom.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16">  On February 15, 2019, Russian authorities in the western Siberian city of Surgut arrested 17 Witness men and one woman for alleged extremist activity. Some of the men were taken to the Investigative Committee offices, where they were interrogated. When they refused to disclose details of their fellow worshippers, the men were tortured with suffocation, stun guns, and beatings. One Witness, Timofey Zhukov, was forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks to undergo an examination because he refused to provide information during the interrogation. The arrested Witnesses have filed appeals against this unlawful treatment, which includes torture, falsifying evidence, and use of biased experts during trial. They are awaiting the court’s verdict.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17">  In May 2021, Russian authorities initiated a criminal case against 55-year-old Anna Safronova, accusing her of “extremist” activity. They placed Anna, the primary caregiver for her elderly mother, under house arrest and froze her bank accounts. On January 25, 2022, she was sentenced to six years in a penal colony, the longest sentence imposed on a female since the 2017 ban. She was immediately taken into custody. Anna appealed her conviction, but on April 14, 2022, the Astrakhan Regional Court denied her appeal. She remains in the Detention Center No. 1 in the Republic of Dagestan. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>Continued Efforts to End Unjust Imprisonments</strong></h2>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19">Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide are greatly distressed by the harsh treatment of their fellow believers in Russia. Millions of Witnesses all over the world have sent letters to government officials in Russia, appealing to them in behalf of imprisoned Witnesses.  Attorneys for imprisoned Witnesses have submitted complaints to the UN Human Rights Committee and to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and have filed appeals to every level of Russian courts. Scores of applications have been filed with the European Court of Human Rights. Official reports have been submitted to international organizations that monitor human rights abuses. Jehovah’s Witnesses will continue to pursue these efforts and to raise awareness of the plight of their fellow believers in Russia in order to end this grave religious persecution.</p>

<p id="p83" data-pid="83"><strong>Andrey Vlasov</strong></p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84">In July 2020, FSB officers conducted searches of homes and workplaces of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Prokopievsk (Kemerovo Region), including those of Andrey Vlasov. He was detained for two days under suspicion of organizing the activities of an extremist organization and then released under house arrest. A criminal trial began, and on May 23, 2022, Andrey was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was taken into custody directly from the courtroom.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85">Andrey was born in November 1968 in Prokopievsk. As a child, he was fond of model building and drawing, and he was a member of a radio club and played in a brass band. He graduated from the Siberian Metallurgical Institute in Novokuznetsk as a mechanical engineer. Later, he received additional training as a computer operator, and he has recently worked as a photographer.</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86">Andrey was introduced to the teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses by his younger brother about 30 years ago. In 2003, Andrey married Natalya, also one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Together, they enjoy traveling and spending time with friends.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87">Criminal prosecution radically changed the life of Andrey and Natalya. Because of being under house arrest, Andrey was unable to provide materially for his family, so this responsibility fell on Natalya. Additionally, Andrey suffers from a physical disability that severely limits his movement, requiring that he use a cane to walk. His health has deteriorated because of the stress of criminal prosecution. Knowing his good reputation in the community, Andrey’s family, friends, and neighbors do not understand his conviction for alleged extremist activity. Andrey is now confined to Detention Center No. 2 in the Kemerovo Region, awaiting an appeal hearing.</p>

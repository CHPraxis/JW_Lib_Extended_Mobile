<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su">  Resolve that you will not take out your stress on each other. Patience and tolerance go a long way.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="su">  At least once a week, discuss with your mate the situations that need to be addressed. Remember to target the problem​—not each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="su">  Make time to do things together that you both enjoy.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="su">  Reminisce about good times that you have shared together, perhaps looking at photos of your wedding or other pleasant memories.</p>

They can nudge you in the right direction, even if it’s just by reminding you of things that you already know. Friends care for you, and they know that you care for them.”​—Nicole.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="su">  Create an environment that makes it comfortable for your children to express themselves. Some children talk more readily while relaxed, such as when riding in the car or walking, rather than when sitting with a parent face-to-face.</p>

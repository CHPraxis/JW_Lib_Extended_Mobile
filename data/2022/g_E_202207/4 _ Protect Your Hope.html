<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Others escape their anxieties through alcohol or drugs.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Take one day at a time. Do not let anxieties about tomorrow keep you from handling today’s responsibilities.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Worrying about negative things that <em>might</em> happen will only add to your stress and weaken your hope for a better future.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sc"><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “All the days of the afflicted one are bad, but the one with a cheerful heart has a continual feast.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:15</a>) A negative outlook can blind you to solutions that are readily available. In contrast, a positive attitude might help you think of ways to deal with your situation.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="su">  Limit the amount of time and attention you give to the news.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="su">  At the end of each day, list two or three things for which you can be thankful.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="su">  Make a to-do list, and include only what you can do today. Break down larger tasks into smaller ones so that you will see the results of your efforts at the end of the day.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">  Reach out to family members or friends for support.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">An ancient psalmist said in prayer to God: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:105</a>) Consider how the Bible​—God’s Word—​is just that.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">On a dark night, a lamp helps us decide where to walk. Likewise, the Bible contains practical wisdom that can guide us when we need to make a difficult decision.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A light can illuminate our path so that we can see what is farther ahead. In a similar way, the Bible can illuminate our view of what the future holds.</p>

<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div class="boxContent"><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="big">The Bible is a sacred book that not only traces man’s history from the start but also provides genuine hope for the future. It answers these questions:</p>
<h3 id="p36" data-pid="36"><strong>How?</strong></h3>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sc">How suffering began: The Bible says that “through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p38" data-pid="38"><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sc">Why human rule has failed to fix our problems: The Bible says that “it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) A look at the world scene confirms that fact.</p>
<h3 id="p40" data-pid="40"><strong>What?</strong></h3>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sc">What God will do to address the situation: The Bible shows that “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

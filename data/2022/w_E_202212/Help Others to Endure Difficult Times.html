<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>DID you know that you can be used by Jehovah to answer someone’s fervent prayer? That is true whether you are an elder, a ministerial servant, a pioneer, or a congregation publisher. It is true whether you are young or old or whether you are a brother or a sister. When someone who loves Jehovah calls out to him for help, our God often uses the elders and other faithful servants to become “a source of great comfort” to that person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:11-51:4:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 4:11</a>) What a privilege it is to serve Jehovah and our brothers in that way! We may be able to do so when there is a disease outbreak, a disaster, or persecution.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> Why might it be challenging to help others during a disease outbreak?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> A disease outbreak can make it difficult for us to help one another. For example, we may wish to visit our friends, but it is not safe to do so. We may want to invite those who are struggling financially to join us for a meal, but this too is not possible. We may want to help others, but that can be challenging if our own family members are suffering. Still, we want to help our brothers, and Jehovah is pleased when we do what we can for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 3:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19:17</a>) What can we do?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What do we learn from the example of the elders in Desi’s congregation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:4-24:23:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:4</a>)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>What elders can do.</em></strong> If you are an elder, get to know the sheep well. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:4-24:23:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah 23:4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Desi, a sister quoted in the preceding article, says, “The elders in my service group have in the past joined me and others in the ministry and for social activities.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> The efforts of those shepherds made it easier for them to help Desi after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and she lost some family members to the virus.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> Why were the elders able to help Desi, and what is the lesson?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Desi explains, “Because I already knew the elders as friends, it was easy for me to tell them how I felt and what my concerns were.” The lesson for elders? Shepherd those under your care <strong><em>before</em></strong> there is a crisis. Be a friend to them. If there is a disease outbreak that prevents you from making personal visits, reach out in other ways. “Sometimes several different elders called or sent me messages on the same day,” says Desi. “The scriptures they shared touched me, even though I knew those verses well.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How can elders learn what the brothers and sisters need and be of help to them?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> One way that you can learn what your brothers and sisters need is by drawing them out with tactful questions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 20:5</a>) Do they have enough food, medicine, and other supplies? Are they at risk of losing their job or even their home? Do they need assistance with applying for government aid? Desi received material help from fellow believers. But it was the emotional and spiritual support from the elders that especially helped her to get through her trials. She says: “The elders prayed with me. Even though I can’t remember exactly what they said, I remember how I felt. It was Jehovah’s way of saying, ‘You are not alone.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 41:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:13-23:41:13" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) Even a small expression of our love can have a powerful effect on someone who is ill. A child could send a card or a drawing to encourage a brother. A young adult might be able to run an errand or shop for a sister. What about preparing a meal that can safely be left at the home of someone who is ill? Of course, when a disease is widespread, everyone in the congregation needs encouragement. Perhaps we can stay a little longer after meetings to visit with the brothers and sisters, whether in person or via videoconferencing. And the elders need encouragement too. Some Witnesses have sent a thank-you note to the elders, who are often busier than ever during a disease outbreak. How good it is when we do our part to “keep encouraging one another and building one another up”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>HELP OTHERS IN THE FACE OF A DISASTER</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What might be challenging after a disaster?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> A disaster can upset a person’s life in the blink of an eye. Victims may lose their possessions, their home, or even their loved ones. Our Christian brothers and sisters are not shielded from such tragic events. What can we do to help?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What can elders and family heads do before a disaster strikes?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>What elders can do.</em></strong> Elders, help your brothers to be prepared before a disaster strikes. Make sure that all in the congregation know what steps to take to stay safe and to contact the elders. Margaret, quoted in the preceding article, says: “Our elders presented a local needs part, warning us that the wildfire season was not over. They said that should the authorities order an evacuation or should conditions become dangerous, we must leave immediately.” That was timely information because a life-threatening wildfire broke out five weeks later. During family worship, family heads can review what each family member will do. If you and your children are prepared, you will be more likely to remain calm if a disaster occurs.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> How can elders organize their efforts before and after a disaster?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> If you are a group overseer, do not wait for a disaster to occur before making sure that you have accurate contact information of all in your field service group who offer it. Make a list and keep it up-to-date. Then in the event of a disaster, you will be in a position to contact each publisher to assess his needs. Forward this information immediately to the coordinator of the body of elders, who will contact the circuit overseer. The combined effort can make a difference. After the fire, Margaret’s circuit overseer stayed awake for 36 hours, coordinating the elders’ efforts to contact and to care for some 450 displaced brothers and sisters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:27-47:11:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:27</a>) Thus, all who needed a place to stay were provided with shelter.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> Why do elders consider shepherding to be important? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 21:15</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Providing spiritual and emotional help is part of the work done by Christian elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:2</a>) In the face of a disaster, elders should first make sure <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that each brother and sister is safe and has food, clothing, and shelter. But for many months thereafter, survivors will likely need spiritual and emotional support. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>John 21:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> “It takes time to recover,” says Harold, who serves on a Branch Committee and who has met with many brothers and sisters affected by disasters. “They may begin to get over their losses, but memories of a lost loved one, a treasured heirloom, or a narrow escape can persist. These memories may trigger feelings of grief all over again. That is not a lack of faith but a normal human reaction.”</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What ongoing needs may families have?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Elders take to heart the counsel to “weep with those who weep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15</a>) Survivors may need reassurance that they have not lost Jehovah’s love or that of their Christian brothers. Elders will want to help families to maintain their spiritual routine, including prayer, study, meeting attendance, and engaging in the preaching work. Elders can also encourage parents to help their children to focus on things that no disaster can destroy. Parents, remind your children that Jehovah will always be their Friend and that he will always be there for them. And be sure to explain that they can remain part of a worldwide family of brothers and sisters who are ready to come to their aid.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> In lands where our work is banned, persecution makes life more complicated. Brothers in those lands still face economic challenges, get sick, and lose loved ones in death. But because of the ban, elders may not be able to move about or to communicate freely with those who need encouragement. That was true of Andrei, referred to in the preceding article. A sister in his field service group was struggling financially. Then she was in a car accident. She needed several surgeries and could not work. Despite the restrictions and the pandemic, the brothers did what they could to help, and Jehovah was watching.</p>

Have you carefully read this year’s issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
How will we be rewarded if we spend time talking to, listening to, and thinking about Jehovah?
We will make better decisions, be better teachers, have stronger faith, and grow in our love for Jehovah.​—w22.01, pp. 30-31.
How will we be helped if we learn to trust in Jehovah and his representatives?
Now is the time to learn to trust in God’s way of doing things by not second-guessing the direction and the decisions of the elders. When the great tribulation strikes, we will be ready to obey even if we receive instructions that seem strange or illogical.​—w22.02, pp. 4-6.
What was the angel’s point in telling Zechariah about a “plumb line in the hand of [Governor] Zerubbabel”? (Zech. 4:8-10)

How can we be “an example . . . in speaking”? (1 Tim. 4:12)
We speak with kindness and respect in our ministry, sing wholeheartedly, comment regularly at meetings, and speak truthfully and build others up, avoiding abusive speech.​—w22.04, pp. 6-9.
Why are the characteristics of the four beasts (kingdoms) mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 combined into one beast as described at Revelation 13:1, 2?
The beast of Revelation 13 does not represent just one specific kingdom, such as Rome. Rather, it represents all political powers that have dominated mankind.​—w22.05, p. 9.
What is a key way to show our confidence in God’s justice?

A brother who is offering a prayer at a meeting should keep what in mind?
Prayer is not to be used to counsel the congregation or to make an announcement. Especially at the beginning of a meeting, the use of “many words” is not needed. (Matt. 6:7)​—w22.07, pp. 24-25.
In what way will “those who practiced vile things” experience “a resurrection of judgment”? (John 5:29)

Why can we conclude that the words of Psalm 37:10, 11, 29 had an ancient fulfillment and will be fulfilled in the future?

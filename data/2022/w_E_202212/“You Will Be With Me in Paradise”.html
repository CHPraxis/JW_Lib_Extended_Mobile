<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JESUS and the two criminals beside him were suffering as they felt their life draining away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:32-42:23:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 23:32, 33</a>) Both of the criminals had been speaking abusively of Jesus, so they clearly were not his disciples.

He said: “Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.” Jesus replied: “Truly I tell you today, you will be with me <strong><em>in Paradise.”</em> (Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:39-42:23:43" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 23:39-43</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Nothing suggests that this criminal had accepted the message about “the Kingdom of the heavens,” which Jesus preached during his ministry. And Jesus never did say that the man would get into the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 4:17</a>) Jesus was speaking about the future earthly Paradise. Why can we say that?</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The repentant criminal was likely a Jew. That criminal said to the other: “Do you not fear <strong><em>God</em></strong> at all, now that you have received the same judgment?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:40-42:23:40" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 23:40</a>) The Jews worshipped one God, but people from the nations believed in many gods.

The repentant criminal may have known about this, and as his words suggest, he assumed that Jehovah would resurrect Jesus to rule in God’s <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>Kingdom. The man apparently hoped that God would also resurrect him.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What likely came to the repentant criminal’s mind when Jesus mentioned Paradise? Explain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15</a>)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As a Jew, the repentant criminal would have known about Adam and Eve and the Paradise in which Jehovah had placed them.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ words to the criminal should move us to think about what life in Paradise will be like. Actually, we can learn something about Paradise from the peaceful rule of King Solomon. And we can expect that Jesus, the one greater than Solomon, will work along with his corulers to bring wonderful conditions to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:42-40:12:42" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 12:42</a>) Understandably, the “other sheep” should be interested in what they need to do to qualify to live forever in Paradise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>

Perhaps you envision a beautiful park like the garden of Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7-9</a>) You may recall the prophecy recorded by Micah that God’s people will sit “each one under his vine and under his fig tree.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mic. 4:3, 4</a>) The Bible’s indications that there will be plenty of food may come to your mind.

You may imagine the air filled with the clean scent of plants and flowers. And you very likely hear the sound of laughter as family and friends​—including resurrected ones—​enjoy one another’s company. All that is no mere dream. Without doubt, scenes like these will take place on earth. However, life in Paradise will also include refreshing work.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> King David was inspired to write about what life would be like when a future wise and faithful king would sit on the throne. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:10, 11,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> <strong>29</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> We often read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a> to others when discussing the coming Paradise. That is certainly justified because Jesus quoted that text in his Sermon on the Mount, indicating that it will have a future fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:5-40:5:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 5:5</a>) But David’s words also revealed what life would be like in King Solomon’s day. When Solomon ruled Israel, God’s people enjoyed special peace and prosperity in a land “flowing with milk and honey.” God had said: “If you continue walking in my statutes . . . , I will put peace in the land, and you will lie down with no one making you afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:24-3:20:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Lev. 20:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:3-3:26:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:6-3:26:6" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6</a>) Those promises came true during Solomon’s reign.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What did the queen of Sheba say about the rule of King Solomon?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:1-11:10:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:1</a>) After inspecting Solomon’s kingdom, she said: “I had not been told the half. . . .

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> In what ways is Jesus superior to Solomon?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Jesus is superior to Solomon in every way. Solomon was an imperfect man who made serious errors in judgment that eventually brought hardship on God’s people. Jesus, on the other hand, is a perfect Ruler who makes no mistakes.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Jesus will have 144,000 corulers working with him to care for mankind and to fulfill Jehovah’s purpose for the earth.

The Law was “a shadow of the good things to come,” so it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus’ corulers will assist in the unique role of caring for the physical and spiritual needs of God’s people.

We will always have interesting people to meet and meaningful work to do. Best of all, each day we will be able to come to know our heavenly Father better and enjoy what he has provided. We will never run out of things to learn about him, and there will be so much to learn about his creation. The longer we live, the deeper our love for God will be. How grateful we are to Jehovah and to Jesus for giving us the promise that we can live forever in Paradise!</p>

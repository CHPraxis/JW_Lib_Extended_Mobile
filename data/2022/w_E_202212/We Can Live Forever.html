However, Jehovah warned Adam: “As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17</a>) Had Adam and Eve obeyed Jehovah, they would not have died.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">The most common Hebrew word often translated “forever” is <em>ʽoh·lamʹ.</em> As used in the Bible, it can refer to something that existed for a long time in the past or will exist long into the future, with no stated beginning or ending point. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:2-6:24:2" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Josh. 24:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:7-19:24:7" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Ps. 24:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:9-19:24:9" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 9</a>) It can also refer to something that is absolutely never-ending. It is in this sense that Jehovah is forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:12-19:102:12" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ps. 102:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:24-19:102:24" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:27-19:102:27" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 27</a>) The <em>New World Translation</em> renders this Hebrew word with such terms as “forever,” “lasting,” “everlasting,” or “long ago.” The context determines which expression is used.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong> (a) What else indicates that humans were not meant to die? (b) What interests do you long to pursue? (See pictures.)</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> It is intriguing that some researchers point to scientific evidence that our brain has the capacity to store far more information than we can gather during our present life span. In 2010 an article in the journal <em>Scientific American Mind</em> said that one estimate of the capacity of our brain was approximately <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>2.5 million gigabytes, the equivalent of three million hours (over 300 years) of recorded TV. That figure may turn out to be a gross underestimation. However, it illustrates that Jehovah designed our brain to handle much more information than we acquire in just 70 or 80 years.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jehovah has also created within us a strong desire to keep living. The Bible says regarding humans that God has “put eternity in their heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) That is one reason why we view death as an enemy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26</a>) If we become seriously ill, do we just accept the condition and give up? No. Usually, we visit a physician and perhaps take medicine to combat the disease. In fact, we do all we reasonably can to avoid dying. And when someone we love dies, whether that person is young or old, do we not feel deep and lasting emotional pain? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:32-43:11:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 11:32, 33</a>) Certainly, our loving Creator would not give us the desire and the capacity to keep living unless his purpose was for humans to keep living. But we have further compelling reasons to believe that we can have unending life. Let us consider some of Jehovah’s past and present actions that prove he has not changed his original purpose.</p>

That hope can help us to remain loyal during these difficult last days. But to please Jehovah, we must be motivated by more than just a desire to stay alive. Our primary reason for remaining loyal to Jehovah and Jesus is that we love them deeply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>) That love motivates us to imitate them and to share with others the hope we have.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Special Campaign to Start Bible Studies in September




During September, we will make a concerted effort to offer Bible studies to every household, using the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. Publishers may choose to auxiliary pioneer with a 30-hour requirement. How will we carry out this special campaign?
  On the Initial Call: Use the back cover of the brochure to generate interest, and try to demonstrate a study. Keep in mind those who previously showed interest, including return visits. Even if they declined to study in the past, they may be interested in our new study method and brochure. Brochures should not be left at not-at-homes or enclosed in letters to those who have not previously expressed interest. The Congregation Service Committee may arrange additional meetings for service during the month.

  Other Opportunities: If your congregation uses literature carts, display the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. Inform those who express interest that the brochure comes with a free Bible course. Demonstrate the study briefly on the spot, or arrange to do so later. The service overseer may arrange for qualified publishers to go to businesses in the territory and offer Bible studies. You might also offer a Bible study to workmates or to people you meet while witnessing informally.


Jesus commanded us to “make disciples,” “teaching them.” (Mt 28:19, 20) May this special campaign help us to accomplish this objective, using Enjoy Life Forever!

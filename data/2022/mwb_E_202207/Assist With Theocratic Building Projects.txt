Assist With Theocratic Building Projects




The construction of theocratic facilities is a form of sacred service. (Ex 36:1) Could you periodically support projects close to home by filling out a Local Design/​Construction Volunteer Application (DC-50)? Or could you make yourself available to support more distant projects for several weeks or months by filling out an Application for Volunteer Program (A-19)? Construction experience is not a requirement to volunteer.​—Ne 2:1, 4, 5.

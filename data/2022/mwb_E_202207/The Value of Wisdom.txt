TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
The Value of Wisdom




Solomon asked Jehovah for wisdom (1Ki 3:7-9; w11 12/15 8 ¶4-6)
Solomon’s request pleased Jehovah (1Ki 3:10-13)
Because Solomon valued godly wisdom, the nation lived in security (1Ki 4:25)
A wise person combines knowledge with understanding and puts them to work in a practical way. Wisdom is more valuable than gold. (Pr 16:16) We can acquire wisdom by asking God for it, fearing him, being humble and modest, and digging into his Word.

Solomon’s Humble, Heartfelt Public Prayer




At the temple inauguration, Solomon offered a heartfelt prayer in front of the people (1Ki 8:22; w09 11/15 9 ¶9-10)
Solomon praised Jehovah and did not draw attention to himself (1Ki 8:23, 24)
Solomon prayed with a humble spirit (1Ki 8:27; w99 1/15 17 ¶7-8)
Solomon provides a good example, especially for those who pray publicly. We should focus more on how we sound to Jehovah than on how we sound to people.

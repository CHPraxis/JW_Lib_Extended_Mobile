TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
What We Can Learn From Two Pillars




Two conspicuous pillars were built for the porch of the temple (1Ki 7:15, 16; w13 12/1 13 ¶3)
The pillars were given meaningful names (1Ki 7:21; it-1 348)
Jehovah would help the people “firmly establish” the temple as long as they relied on him (1Ki 7:21, ftn.; Ps 127:1)
Jehovah may have helped us to overcome many obstacles in order to come into the truth. But we must continue to rely on him in order to “stand firm in the faith.”​—1Co 16:13.





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How am I demonstrating my reliance on Jehovah?’

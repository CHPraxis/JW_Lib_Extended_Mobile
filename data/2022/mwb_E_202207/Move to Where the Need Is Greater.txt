LIVING AS CHRISTIANS | SET GOALS FOR THE NEW SERVICE YEAR
Move to Where the Need Is Greater




Faith is needed to move from familiar surroundings to a new location in order to expand your ministry. (Heb 11:8-10) If you are considering the goal of moving to where the need is greater, talk to your elders. What practical steps can you take to calculate the cost and choose a location? Consider published material about serving where the need is greater. Talk to those who have successfully moved to assist another congregation. (Pr 15:22) Seek Jehovah’s direction through prayer. (Jas 1:5) Research any area you are considering, and if possible, visit the location for more than a few days before deciding.

Speak to your circuit overseer if you would like information about nearby congregations that have a need. If you want information about more distant congregations, write to the branch office through your Congregation Service Committee. If the congregations are outside your branch territory, write to the branch office that oversees the work in that country. If there is a specific area that you prefer, you may mention this in your letter.

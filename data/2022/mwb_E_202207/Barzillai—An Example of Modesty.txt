Barzillai​—An Example of Modesty




Barzillai was offered a privilege by King David (2Sa 19:32, 33; w07 7/15 14 ¶5)
Modesty moved Barzillai to decline the offer respectfully (2Sa 19:34, 35; w07 7/15 14 ¶7)
Be modest like Barzillai (w07 7/15 15 ¶1-2)
Modesty makes us aware of our limitations. We must be modest in order to please Jehovah. (Mic 6:8) How do we benefit when we display this quality?

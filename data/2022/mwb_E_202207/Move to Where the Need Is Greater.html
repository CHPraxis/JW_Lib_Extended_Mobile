(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:8-58:11:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb 11:8-10</a>) If you are considering the goal of moving to where the need is greater, talk to your elders. What practical steps can you take to calculate the cost and choose a location? Consider published material about serving where the need is greater. Talk to those who have successfully moved to assist another congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Pr 15:22</a>) Seek Jehovah’s direction through prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas 1:5</a>) Research any area you are considering, and if possible, visit the location for more than a few days before deciding.</p>

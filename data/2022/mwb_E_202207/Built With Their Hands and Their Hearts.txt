King Solomon checking on the progress of the temple project



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Built With Their Hands and Their Hearts




Solomon used the best building materials for the temple (1Ki 5:6, 17; w11 2/1 15)
Many shared in the work (1Ki 5:13-16; it-1 424; it-2 1077 ¶1)
Solomon and the people worked hard for seven years to complete the project (1Ki 6:38; see cover picture)
Solomon and the people were able to build a beautiful temple to Jehovah’s praise because their hearts were in the work. Sadly, enthusiasm for Jehovah’s worship faded with future generations. They allowed the temple to fall into disrepair, and eventually it was destroyed.





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How am I maintaining my enthusiasm for Jehovah’s worship?’

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Is Your Giving a Sacrifice?




David was instructed to set up an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah (2Sa 24:18)
Araunah graciously offered to donate the land and sacrificial animals (2Sa 24:21-23)
David would not offer sacrifices that cost him nothing (2Sa 24:24, 25; it-1 146)





Jehovah is pleased when we willingly sacrifice our time, energy, and resources in order to promote Kingdom interests. (w12 1/15 18 ¶8) What goals could you set to increase your “sacrifice of praise” to him?​—Heb 13:15.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Do You Look for the Answers to Your Prayers?




The Bible is filled with examples of prayers that were answered by Jehovah. When God’s servants saw how Jehovah listened to their individual concerns and helped them, their faith was undoubtedly strengthened. Therefore, it is good for us to be specific in our personal prayers and then to try to discern Jehovah’s answer. Keep in mind that his answer may be different from or more than what we requested. (2Co 12:7-9; Eph 3:20) What may Jehovah provide in answer to our requests?
  Physical, emotional, or spiritual strength to deal with a problem.​—Php 4:13

  Wisdom to make a good decision.​—Jas 1:5

  Desire and power to act.​—Php 2:13

  Calmness when we are anxious.​—Php 4:6, 7

  Physical or emotional support from others.​—1Jo 3:17, 18

  Help for those we pray for.​—Ac 12:5, 11

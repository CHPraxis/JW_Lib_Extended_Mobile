TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Is a God of Justice




Jehovah did not forget the injustice committed against the Gibeonites (2Sa 21:1, 2)
Silver and gold could not atone for the bloodguilt of Saul and his household (Nu 35:31, 33; 2Sa 21:3, 4)
Seven of Saul’s descendants were executed to satisfy justice (2Sa 21:5, 6; it-1 932 ¶1)





How can Romans 12:19-21 help us when we are victims of unjust treatment?

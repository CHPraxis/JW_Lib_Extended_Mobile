TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Rely On Jehovah for Help




Jehovah hears our cries for help (2Sa 22:7)
Jehovah is stronger than any enemy (2Sa 22:14-18; cl 19 ¶11)
Jehovah loyally acts in our behalf (2Sa 22:26; w10 6/1 26 ¶4-6)





Jehovah has the ability to remove our trials. However, in most cases, he helps us to cope with them by means of his holy spirit, his Word, and our Christian brotherhood. (Ps 55:22) In what ways can we avail ourselves of God’s help?

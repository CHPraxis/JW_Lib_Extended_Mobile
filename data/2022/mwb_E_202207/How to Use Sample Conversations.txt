LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
How to Use Sample Conversations




Much thought goes into the sample conversations, and many publishers have found them to be effective in their territory. However, since circumstances vary around the world, publishers are free to use in their ministry a different approach or discuss a different topic that will appeal to people locally. Of course, all should follow any instructions for a special campaign. Our goal is to fulfill Jesus’ commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom.​—Mt 24:14.
When caring for student assignments, publishers should discuss the topic of the sample conversation in the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook. However, unless indicated otherwise, they are free to choose a different question, scripture, link, or setting that will be effective in the local territory. This adjusts the direction that appeared on page 8 of the June 2020 issue of the meeting workbook.

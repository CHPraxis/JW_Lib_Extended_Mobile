TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Do You Learn From Your Mistakes?




[Play the video Introduction to 1 Kings.]
Adonijah was shown mercy after ambitiously scheming to become king (1Ki 1:5, 52, 53; it-2 987 ¶4)
Adonijah did not learn from his mistake and suffered the consequences (1Ki 2:15-17, 22, 23; it-1 49)
A wise person will learn from his mistakes. Even better, he will learn from the mistakes of others.​—1Co 10:11.

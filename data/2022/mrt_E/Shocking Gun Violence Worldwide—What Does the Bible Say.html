(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) However, the Bible promises a time when violence will end and “people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place, in secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:18-23:32:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:18</a>) How will violence end?</p>

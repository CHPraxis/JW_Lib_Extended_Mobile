LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Use Current Events in Your Ministry




In his ministry, Jesus drew lessons from current events. (Lu 13:1-5) You too can use current events to stir people’s interest in the Kingdom message. After mentioning the high cost of living, a natural disaster, civil unrest, drug addiction, or something similar, ask a thought-provoking question. You might ask: “Do you think we’ll ever see an end to . . . ?” or “What do you think is the solution to . . . ?” Then, share a Bible verse related to the topic. If the person shows interest, direct his attention to a video or a publication in our Teaching Toolbox. As we strive to touch the hearts of people in our territory, may we “do all things for the sake of the good news.”​—1Co 9:22, 23.

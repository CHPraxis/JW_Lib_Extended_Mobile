LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Keep Your Desires Under Control




As imperfect humans, we have a constant struggle to keep our desires under control. If we give them free rein, we could lose Jehovah’s favor. For instance, some allow a desire for food, clothing, and shelter to crowd out their love for God. Others satisfy their sexual desire with no regard for God’s standards. (Ro 1:26, 27) Still others cave in to peer pressure because of a desire to be liked or accepted.​—Ex 23:2.
How can we keep our desires in check? We must do our best to focus on spiritual things. (Mt 4:4) Also, we should beg Jehovah to help us control our desires. Why? Because he knows what is best for us and knows how to satisfy our proper desires.​—Ps 145:16.

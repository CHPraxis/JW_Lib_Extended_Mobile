“Love . . . Does Not Rejoice Over Unrighteousness”




In all their activity, true Christians strive to be guided by love. Love “does not rejoice over unrighteousness.” (1Co 13:4, 6) Therefore, we shun entertainment that glorifies such things as immorality and violence. Also, we do not rejoice when bad things happen to others, even to those who have hurt us.​—Pr 17:5.

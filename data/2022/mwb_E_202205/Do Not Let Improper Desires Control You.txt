TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Do Not Let Improper Desires Control You




David allowed an improper desire to develop in his heart (2Sa 11:2-4; w21.06 17 ¶10)
David misused his power to cover up his wrongdoing (2Sa 11:5, 14, 15; w19.09 17 ¶15)
David suffered terrible consequences for his sin (2Sa 12:9-12; w18.06 17 ¶7)
To avoid looking at or thinking about improper things, we need self-discipline. (Ga 5:16, 22, 23) Jehovah can help us not to allow improper desires to take root in our heart.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what areas do I need greater control of my thoughts?’

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In his ministry, Jesus drew lessons from current events. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:1-42:13:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 13:1-5</a>) You too can use current events to stir people’s interest in the Kingdom message. After mentioning the high cost of living, a natural disaster, civil unrest, drug addiction, or something similar, ask a thought-provoking question. You might ask: “Do you think we’ll ever see an end to . . . ?” or “What do you think is the solution to . . . ?” Then, share a Bible verse related to the topic. If the person shows interest, direct his attention to a video or a publication in our Teaching Toolbox. As we strive to touch the hearts of people in our territory, may we “do all things for the sake of the good news.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:22-46:9:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Co 9:22, 23</a>.</p>

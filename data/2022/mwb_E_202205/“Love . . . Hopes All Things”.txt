LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Love . . . Hopes All Things”




Motivated by unselfish love, we hope the best for our brothers. (1Co 13:4, 7) For example, if a brother commits a sin and receives discipline, we hope that he will respond to efforts to readjust him. We are patient with those who are weak in faith, and we try to help them. (Ro 15:1) If someone leaves the congregation, we do not give up hope that he will someday return.​—Lu 15:17, 18.

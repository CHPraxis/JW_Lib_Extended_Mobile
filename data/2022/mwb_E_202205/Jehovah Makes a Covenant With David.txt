David meditates on the covenant Jehovah made with him



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Makes a Covenant With David




Jehovah decreed that he would make a dynasty for David (2Sa 7:11, 12, ftn.; w10 4/1 20 ¶3; see cover picture)
Aspects of Jehovah’s covenant with David were fulfilled in the Messiah (2Sa 7:13, 14; Heb 1:5; w10 4/1 20 ¶4)
The Messiah’s accomplishments will last forever (2Sa 7:15, 16; Heb 1:8; w14 10/15 10 ¶14)





The sun and moon are fitting reminders of the permanence of the Messiah’s rule. (Ps 89:35-37) When you see them, think about the blessings that Jehovah has promised to you and your family through His Kingdom.

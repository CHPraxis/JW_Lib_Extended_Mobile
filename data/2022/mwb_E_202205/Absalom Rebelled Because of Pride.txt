Absalom Rebelled Because of Pride




Absalom sought glory for himself (2Sa 15:1; it-1 860)
Absalom stole the hearts of the people (2Sa 15:2-6; w12 7/15 13 ¶5)
Absalom tried to seize his father’s kingship (2Sa 15:10-12; it-1 1083-1084)
We must not allow ambition to take root in our heart. Rather, we should regularly examine our motives. Instead of seeking to impress others, we sincerely look out for their interests.​—Php 2:3, 4.

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Maintain a Healthy Fear of Displeasing Jehovah




Good intentions do not change what Jehovah requires (2Sa 6:3-5; w05 5/15 17 ¶8)
Uzzah violated God’s Law (2Sa 6:6; w05 2/1 27 ¶20)
Jehovah punished Uzzah for his irreverent act (2Sa 6:7; w05 2/1 27 ¶21)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I show in my personal life that I fear displeasing Jehovah?’​—Pr 3:7

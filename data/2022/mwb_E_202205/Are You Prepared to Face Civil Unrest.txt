LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Are You Prepared to Face Civil Unrest?




As the end of this system approaches, we expect civil unrest, terrorism, and war to increase. (Re 6:4) How can we prepare for future challenges?
  Prepare spiritually: Identify Bible principles and accounts that strengthen your trust in Jehovah and in his organization and that help you to remain neutral. (Pr 12:5; jr 125-126 ¶23-24) Now is the time to build strong friendships within the congregation.​—1Pe 4:7, 8

  Prepare physically: Have a plan for sheltering in place and a reasonable reserve of supplies. Also, prepare an evacuation plan. Review the contents of your go bag, and include personal protective equipment and money. Know how to contact the elders, and be sure they know how to contact you.​—Isa 32:2; g17.5 3-7


During unrest, maintain your spiritual routine. (Php 1:10) Avoid moving from place to place unless you are evacuating. (Mt 10:16) Share food and other supplies.​—Ro 12:13.

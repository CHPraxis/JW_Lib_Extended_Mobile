David Showed Loyal Love




David searched for someone to whom he could show loyal love (2Sa 9:1; w06 6/15 14 ¶6)
David acted immediately to help Mephibosheth (1Sa 20:15, 42; 2Sa 9:5-7; w05 5/15 17 ¶12)
David assigned Ziba to care for Mephibosheth’s inheritance (2Sa 9:9, 10; w02 2/15 14 ¶10)





David did not forget his promise to Jonathan. We should show loyal love to fellow believers.​—Ps 41:1, 2; Pr 19:17.

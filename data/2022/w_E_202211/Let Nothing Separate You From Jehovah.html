<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHEN WE EXPERIENCE HARDSHIPS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How could hardships undermine our trust in Jehovah and his organization?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> At times, we face hardships​—such as family opposition or the loss of our job. How could such hardships undermine our trust in Jehovah’s organization and separate us from him? When we endure adversity for a long time, we may feel hopeless and downhearted. Satan takes advantage of such opportunities and seeks to get us to doubt Jehovah’s love for us. The Devil wants us to question whether Jehovah or His organization is responsible for our suffering. Something similar happened to some of the Israelites in Egypt. At first they believed that Jehovah had appointed Moses and Aaron to deliver them from slavery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:29-2:4:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 4:29-31</a>) But later when Pharaoh made their lives harder, they blamed Moses and Aaron for their problems, telling them: <strong><em>“You</em></strong> have made Pharaoh and his servants despise us and <strong><em>you</em></strong> have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:5:19-2:5:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 5:19-21</a>) They blamed God’s loyal servants. How sad! If you have been enduring hardships for a long time, how can you keep your trust in Jehovah and his organization strong?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What do we learn from the prophet Habakkuk about how to cope with hardships? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:17-35:3:19" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:17-19</a>)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Pour out your heart to Jehovah in prayer, and look to him for support.</em></strong> The prophet Habakkuk faced many hardships. At one point, he seems to have doubted whether Jehovah cared about him. So he poured out his feelings to Jehovah in prayer. He said: “How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, but you do not hear? . . . Why do you tolerate oppression?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:2-35:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hab. 1:2, 3</a>) Jehovah responded to the heartfelt prayer of his loyal servant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:2-35:2:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hab. 2:2, 3</a>) After meditating on Jehovah’s saving acts, Habakkuk was filled with renewed joy. He became convinced that Jehovah cared for him and would help him endure any trial. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:17-35:3:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Habakkuk 3:17-19</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What is the lesson for us? When you face hardships, pray to Jehovah and tell him how you feel. Then look to him for support. When you do, you can be confident that Jehovah will give you the strength you need to endure. And when you feel his support, your faith in him will grow stronger.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> Of what did Shirley’s relatives try to convince her, and what kept her from losing faith in Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Maintain your spiritual routine.</em></strong> Consider how doing so helped Shirley, a sister in Papua New Guinea, when she faced hardships.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Shirley’s family was poor and, at times, struggled to obtain enough food. A relative tried to undermine her trust in Jehovah. He said: “You say that God’s holy spirit is helping you, but where is the help? The family is still poor. You are wasting your time preaching.” Shirley admits: “I asked myself: ‘Does God care about us or not?’ So I immediately prayed to Jehovah and told <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>him everything that was on my mind. I kept up with reading the Bible and our publications, and I continued to preach and attend meetings.” She soon began to realize that Jehovah was looking after her family. Her family did not go hungry, and they were happy. Shirley says: “I felt that Jehovah was answering my prayers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:6-8</a>) If you stick to your spiritual routine, you too will not allow hardships or doubts to separate you from Jehovah.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What may happen to responsible brothers in Jehovah’s organization?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> By means of the media and social networks, our enemies spread lies or misinformation about responsible brothers in Jehovah’s organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:13-19:31:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 31:13</a>) Some brothers have been arrested and charged as criminals.

Whatever their reason, imagine how Paul must have felt. He had endured many hardships and had even risked his life for them.

What should we keep in mind when responsible brothers are persecuted?</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Remember why we are persecuted</em></strong> <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><strong><em>and who causes it.</em></strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Second Timothy 3:12</a> states: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” So we should not be surprised that Satan targets responsible brothers in his attacks.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Consider the experience of Brizit, a sister in India. She was ridiculed by family members because of her faith. Shortly after her baptism in 1997, her unbelieving husband lost his job. So he decided that he, Brizit, and their daughters should move in with his parents, who lived in another city. But Brizit would face even greater challenges. Because her husband was unemployed, she would have to work full-time to support her family. Additionally, the nearest congregation was about 350 kilometers (220 mi) away. Sadly, her husband’s family opposed her because of her faith. The situation became so critical that Brizit’s family had to move again. Then, unexpectedly, her husband died. Later, one of her daughters died of cancer at just 12 years of age. To make matters worse, Brizit’s relatives blamed her for these events. They claimed that if she had not become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, all those tragedies would not have happened. Still, she kept trusting in Jehovah and remained close to his organization.</p>

At first, she felt overwhelmed. But she followed the direction. She shared the good news with others, held meetings in her home, and set aside time for family worship with her daughters. What was the result? Brizit was able to start <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>and conduct many Bible studies, and a number of her students got baptized. In 2005 she began serving as a regular pioneer. Her trust in Jehovah and her loyalty to his organization were rewarded. Her daughters are faithfully serving Jehovah, and there are now two congregations in that area!

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HAS your congregation ever built or renovated a Kingdom Hall? If so, no doubt you remember your first meeting in the new facility. You were so grateful to Jehovah. In fact, you may have been so choked up with emotion that you could hardly sing the opening song. Our well-built Kingdom Halls bring praise to Jehovah. But we bring even greater praise to him when we engage in another kind of building work. That work involves something more valuable than literal buildings. It involves building up the people who come to those places of worship. The apostle Paul had in mind this type of figurative building program when he wrote the words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:11</strong></a><strong>,</strong> our theme text.​—<strong>Read.</strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The apostle Paul is an excellent example of someone who knew how to build up his fellow believers. He had empathy for them. In this article, we will consider how he helped his brothers and sisters (1) to endure trials, (2) to be peaceable with one another, and (3) to strengthen their faith in Jehovah. Let us see how we can imitate him and thus build up our brothers and sisters today.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:1</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What balanced view did Paul have?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Paul loved his brothers very much. He was no stranger to hardship; thus, he could show compassion and empathy for fellow believers when they were going through <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>trials. One time, Paul ran out of funds and had to find work to support himself and his companions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:34-44:20:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:34</a>) He was a tentmaker by trade. When he arrived in Corinth, he at first worked with fellow tentmakers Aquila and Priscilla. But “every sabbath” he would preach to the Jews and the Greeks. Then when Silas and Timothy arrived, “Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 18:2-5</a>) Paul never lost sight of his main purpose in life, to serve Jehovah. Hardworking Paul was in a good position to encourage his brothers and sisters. He reminded them not to allow the pressures of life and the need to provide for the family to cause them to neglect “the more important things”​—all aspects of Jehovah’s worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> How did Paul and Timothy help fellow believers to cope with persecution?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Soon after the congregation in Thessalonica was formed, the new believers faced severe opposition. When a mob of vicious opposers could not find Paul and Silas, the mob dragged “some of the brothers to the city rulers,” crying out: “These men act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:6-44:17:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:6, 7</a>) Can you imagine how shaken those newly converted Christians must have been to find that the men of the city had turned against them? They could have slowed down in their service to Jehovah, but Paul did not want that to happen. Although he and Silas had to leave, they made sure that the fledgling congregation was well cared for. Paul reminded the Thessalonians: “We sent Timothy, our brother . . . , to make you firm and comfort you regarding your faith, so that no one might be shaken by these tribulations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:2-52:3:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Thess. 3:2, 3</a>) Timothy very likely had firsthand experience with persecution in his hometown of Lystra. He had seen how Paul strengthened the brothers there. Having seen the outcome that Jehovah gave, Timothy could assure his new brothers and sisters that everything would turn out well for them too.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:8-44:14:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 14:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:22" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Heb. 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> How did a brother named Bryant benefit from the help of an elder?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In what other way did Paul strengthen his fellow believers? On their return visit to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, Paul and Barnabas “appointed elders for them in each congregation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 14:21-23</a>) No doubt those appointed men proved to be a source of comfort to the congregations, as the elders are today. Note the comments made by a brother named Bryant: “When I turned 15,” he says, “my father left home and my mother was disfellowshipped. I felt abandoned and discouraged.” What helped Bryant to endure this difficult time? He says: “Tony, an elder, talked with me at meetings and at other times. He told me about those who had faced trials and yet were happy. He shared <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a> with me and often spoke about Hezekiah, who served faithfully even though his father was not a good example.” What effect did this practical help have on Bryant? “With Tony’s encouragement,” says Bryant, “I eventually began a satisfying career in full-time service.” Elders, be alert to help those who, like Bryant, may need “a good word” of encouragement.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> How did Paul use life stories to encourage his brothers and sisters?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Paul reminded fellow worshippers that in Jehovah’s strength, “a great cloud of witnesses” had endured hardships. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 12:1</a>) Paul understood how the life stories of those in the past who successfully endured all kinds of hardships could infuse his brothers and sisters with courage and help them keep focused on the “city of the living God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22</a>) The same is true today. Who has not been strengthened when reading about how Jehovah helped Gideon, Barak, David, Samuel, and many others? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:35" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-35</a>) And what about modern-day examples of faith? At world headquarters, we often receive letters from brothers and sisters whose faith has been strengthened after they read the life story of one of Jehovah’s modern-day faithful servants.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>PAUL SHOWED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HOW TO BE PEACEABLE WITH ONE ANOTHER</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> What do you learn from Paul’s counsel recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:21" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 14:19-21</a>?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We build up our brothers and sisters when we actively promote peace in the congregation. We do not allow differences of opinion to divide us. And we do not insist on our rights where no Scriptural principle is at stake. Consider an example. The congregation in Rome was made up of both Jewish and Gentile Christians. When the Mosaic Law was done away with, the restrictions it had placed on eating certain foods were no longer in force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:19-41:7:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 7:19</a>) From that time on, some Jewish Christians felt free to eat all kinds of foods. Other Jewish Christians, however, could not bring themselves to do so. The congregation became divided over this issue. Paul underscored the importance of keeping peace and observed: “It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 14:19-21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Paul thus helped his fellow believers to see how damaging such disputes were to individuals and to the congregation as a whole. He was also willing to change his own behavior to avoid stumbling others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-22</a>) We can likewise build others up and maintain peace if we refrain from making issues over matters of personal preference.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How did Paul respond when an important issue threatened the peace of the congregation?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Paul set a good example in maintaining peace with those who disagreed about important matters. For instance, some in the first-century congregation insisted that Gentile converts be circumcised, perhaps to avoid criticism by outsiders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:12-48:6:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gal. 6:12</a>) Paul strongly disagreed with that viewpoint, but rather than insist that his way be followed, he humbly referred the matter to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:1-44:15:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 15:1, 2</a>) As a result, his conduct helped those Christians to maintain joy and peace in the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:30-44:15:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 15:30, 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> How can we follow Paul’s example?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> If a serious dispute does arise, we promote peace by seeking guidance from those whom Jehovah has appointed to <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>care for the congregation. Often, Bible-based direction can be found in our publications or in guidelines provided by the organization. If we focus on following those instructions rather than on promoting our personal views, we will contribute to the peace of the congregation.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> What else did Paul do to promote peace in the congregation?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Paul promoted peace by highlighting the positive qualities of his brothers and sisters, not their negative traits. For example, in closing his letter to the Romans, Paul mentioned many people by name and in most cases added a positive comment or a personal detail about them. We can imitate Paul by freely mentioning the good qualities of our brothers and sisters. When we do, we give our brothers and sisters added reason for drawing close to one another, which builds up the congregation in love.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> How can we restore peace when differences arise?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> At times, even mature Christians may disagree or argue with each other. That happened to Paul and his close friend Barnabas. These two men strongly disagreed about whether to take Mark with them on their next missionary trip. There was “a sharp burst of anger” between them, and they parted ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:37-44:15:39" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 15:37-39</a>) But Paul, Barnabas, and Mark mended the rift in their relationship, showing that they placed value on the peace and unity of the congregation. Paul later spoke well of Barnabas and Mark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:6-46:9:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:10-51:4:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Col. 4:10</a>) We too need to resolve any differences we might have with others in the congregation and then continue to focus on their good qualities. In that way, we will promote peace and unity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:3-49:4:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Eph. 4:3</a>.</p>

For example, when fellow believers in Judea faced a famine, Paul helped distribute relief to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:30" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a>) In fact, even though Paul was busy preaching and teaching, he always looked for ways to help those who needed material assistance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:10-48:2:10" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Gal. 2:10</a>) By so doing, he built up his fellow believers’ confidence that Jehovah would care for them. Today, when we volunteer our time, effort, and skills to help with disaster relief, we too build up the faith of our brothers and sisters. The same happens when we regularly donate toward the worldwide work. In these and other ways, we help our brothers and sisters to trust that Jehovah will never abandon them.</p>

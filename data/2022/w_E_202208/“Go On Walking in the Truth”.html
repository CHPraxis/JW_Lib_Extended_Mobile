<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“HOW did you come into the truth?” No doubt you have answered that question many times. It is one of the first questions that a fellow believer will ask when we are getting acquainted. We love to hear how our brothers and sisters came to know and love Jehovah, and we enjoy telling them what the truth means to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11</a>) As a result of these conversations, we are reminded of just how precious the truth is. We also become even more determined to “go on walking in the truth”​—that is, to keep living in a way that will bring Jehovah’s blessing and approval.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">3 John 4</a>.</p>

Then we will consider how we can continue to show our love for this precious gift. No doubt this review will deepen our appreciation for what Jehovah has done in drawing us to the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) It will also strengthen our desire to share the truth with others.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We love the truth for many reasons. Most important, we love Jehovah God, the Source of the truth. Through his Word, the Bible, we have come to know him not only <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>as the all-powerful Maker of heaven and earth but also as our loving heavenly Father, who tenderly cares for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7</a>) We know that our God is “merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6</a>) Jehovah loves justice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:8-23:61:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8</a>) It hurts him to see us suffer, and he is ready​—yes, eager—​to bring all suffering to an end at the appointed time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 29:11</a>) How marvelous! No wonder we love Jehovah so much!</p>

</div>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>4-5.</strong> Why did the apostle Paul compare our hope to an anchor?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> What is another reason why we love the truth? The truth brings great benefits to us. Consider an example. Bible truth includes our hope for the future. To illustrate the value of that hope, the apostle Paul wrote: “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 6:19</a>) Just as an anchor steadies a boat, our Bible-based hope can stabilize us when we face trials in life.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In this context, Paul was discussing the heavenly hope that anointed Christians cherish. But his words also apply to Christians who look forward to living forever on a paradise earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Certainly, learning about the hope of everlasting life has given our life meaning.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong> How has Yvonne benefited from learning the truth about the future?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider the experience of a sister named Yvonne. She did not grow up in the truth, and as a child she was afraid of death. She recalls reading a phrase that stuck in her mind: “Someday there will be no tomorrow.” She says: “Those words made me lie awake at night thinking about the future. ‘Surely there must be more to life,’ I thought. ‘Why am I here?’ I did not want to die!”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Later, as a teenager, Yvonne came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses. She relates: “I began to believe that I could have the hope of living forever in Paradise on earth.” How has learning the truth benefited our sister? She adds: “I no longer lie awake at night worrying about the future or death.” As you can imagine, the truth is very precious to Yvonne, and she finds great satisfaction in sharing her hope for the future with others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">Serving Jehovah now and having the prospect of doing so forever under the rule of his Kingdom is like a treasure. It is worth any sacrifice we have to make (See paragraphs 8-11)</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>8-9.</strong> (a) In one of Jesus’ parables, how much did one man value a treasure he found? (b) What value do you place on the truth?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Bible truth also includes the good news about God’s Kingdom. Jesus compared the truth about that Kingdom to a hidden treasure. As recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:44-40:13:44" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 13:44</a>, Jesus said: “The Kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure, hidden in the field, that a man found and hid; and because of his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.” Notice that the man was not looking for the treasure. But when he found it, he made major sacrifices to obtain it. In fact, he sold everything he had. Why? He knew how valuable that treasure was. It was worth far more than anything he had to give up.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Is that the way you feel about the truth? No doubt it is! We know that nothing this world has to offer can compare to the joy we have in serving <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>Jehovah now, with the prospect of everlasting life in the future under Kingdom rule. The privilege we have of enjoying a close personal relationship with Jehovah is worth any sacrifice we have to make. Our greatest joy is “to please him fully.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10-11.</strong> What prompted Michael to change the course of his life?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Many of us have made considerable sacrifices in order to obtain Jehovah’s approval. Some have abandoned prestigious careers in the world. Others have given up the pursuit of wealth. Still others have completely changed the course of their life when they learned about Jehovah. That is what Michael did. He did not grow up in the truth. As a young man, he was trained in martial arts. He says: “I took pride in keeping myself in fit physical condition. At times, I felt invincible.” But when he started studying the Bible, Michael learned Jehovah’s view of violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 11:5</a>) Regarding the Witness couple who studied with him, Michael says: “They never told me that I had to give up martial arts; they simply continued to teach me Bible truth.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The more Michael learned about Jehovah, the more his love for Him grew. He was especially touched by Jehovah’s compassion for His worshippers. In time, Michael realized that he needed to make a life-changing decision. “I knew that giving up karate would be the hardest thing I had ever done,” he says. “But I also knew that it would please Jehovah, and I was convinced that serving him was worth any sacrifice.” Michael appreciated the value of the truth he had found, and that appreciation moved him to make big changes in his life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jas. 1:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> To highlight the value of the truth, the Bible compares the truth to a lamp shining in the dark. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:8-49:5:8" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:8</a>) Mayli, from Azerbaijan, deeply appreciates the enlightenment she has received from God’s Word. She grew up in a religiously divided household. Her father was Muslim, and her mother was Jewish. She says: “Although I never questioned God’s existence, there were issues that puzzled me. I wondered, ‘Why did God create humans, and for what useful purpose would someone suffer his entire life only to be tormented forever in hell?’ Since people said that everything that happens is God’s will, I wondered, ‘Is God just a puppeteer who enjoys watching people suffer?’”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Mayli continued to search for answers to her questions. In time, she accepted a Bible study and came into the truth. “The Bible’s convincing logic changed my whole outlook on life for the better,” she says. “The credible explanations I found through God’s Word bring me inner peace.” Like Mayli, we all praise Jehovah, “the One who called [us] out of darkness into his wonderful light.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> What is one way that we can show our love for the truth?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> We can show that we love the truth by regularly studying the Bible and Bible-based publications. After all, no matter how long we have been in the truth, we always have more to learn. The very first issue of this magazine stated: “Truth, like a modest little flower in the wilderness of life, is surrounded and <em>almost</em> choked by the luxuriant growth of the weeds of error. If you would find it you must be ever on the lookout. . . . If you would possess it you must stoop to get it. Be not content with <em>one</em> flower of truth. . . . Gather ever, seek for more.” Study is hard work, but it is well worth the effort.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong> What study method do you find effective? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:4-20:2:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:4-6</a>)</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Not all of us love to read and study. <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>But Jehovah invites us to “keep seeking” and to “keep searching” for a deeper understanding of the truth. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:4-20:2:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 2:4-6</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When we put forth such effort, we always benefit. Regarding his personal Bible reading, Corey says that he focuses on one verse at a time. He explains: “I’ll read every footnote, look up every cross-reference, and do additional research. . . . I get so much out of my reading with this method!” Whether we use that method or another, we show our appreciation for the truth when we put time and effort into studying it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Of course, we know that it is not enough simply to study the truth.

One brother suggests making a personal examination to identify areas where we are doing well and areas where we want to make improvement. The apostle Paul put it this way: “To the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:16-50:3:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16</a>.</p>

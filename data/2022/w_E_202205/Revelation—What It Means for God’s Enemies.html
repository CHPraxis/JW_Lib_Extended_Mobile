(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1-9</a>) That expulsion brings relief to the heavens, but it creates challenges for us. Why? Because Satan’s anger is focused on those who faithfully serve Jehovah here on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 12:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:15-66:12:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1</a>) God’s enemies are described symbolically. We see a number of wild beasts.

The key to understanding it is to allow the Bible to explain itself. Many of the symbols found in Revelation are already explained in other books of the Bible. For example, the prophet Daniel had a dream in which “four huge beasts came out of the sea.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 7:1-3</a>) Daniel records their significance. These huge beasts represent four “kings,” or governments. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:15-27:7:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 7:15-17</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That clear explanation helps us understand that the beasts described in Revelation must also refer to political powers.</p>

All of these are also features of the four beasts mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel chapter 7</a>. Yet, here in the book of Revelation, these characteristics are combined into one beast, not four separate beasts. This wild beast does not represent just one government or world empire. It is spoken of as ruling “over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.” So it must be greater than any single national government. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:7-66:13:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 13:7</a>) This wild beast, then, must represent all the political powers that have dominated humankind down through history.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9</a>.</p>

At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:10-66:17:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 17:10</a>, we are told: “There are seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived; but when he does arrive, he must remain a short while.” Of all the political powers that Satan has used, seven have stood out prominently as “heads.” These are the world empires that have had a considerable impact on God’s people. By the apostle John’s day, five of these had already appeared on the world scene: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece. The sixth world power, Rome, was still ruling when John received the revelation. What would prove <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>to be the seventh and final world power, or head?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> Whom does the seventh head of the wild beast represent?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> As we will see, the prophecies in the book of Daniel help us identify the seventh and final head of the wild beast.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:10-66:1:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 1:10</a>) It is the combination of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, in other words, the Anglo-American World Power. We may therefore conclude that it is the seventh head of the wild beast mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1-4</a>.</p>

<div><p id="p38" data-pid="38">Another indication that the seven-headed beast represents all the political powers is that it has “ten horns.” The number ten is often used in the Bible to denote completeness.</p></div>
<div><p id="p39" data-pid="39">Unlike the first wild beast, the image does not have crowns, or “diadems,” on its horns.

That remarkable book reveals what will happen to those who oppose Jehovah, but it also highlights the blessings that come to those who loyally support his rulership. We do well to consider such vital truths. Doing so will strengthen our resolve to keep on serving Jehovah.

No. To the contrary, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 6</a> shows that at that critical time, people who are not serving Jehovah will seek protection from the political and commercial systems of this world, which are compared to mountains.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> By the end of the 1,000 years, all those living on earth will have been restored to perfect life. No longer will anyone living be affected by the sin that was originally inherited from Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) The curse of Adamic sin will have been completely removed. In that way, those on earth will “come to life” as perfect humans at the end of the 1,000 years.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:5-66:20:5" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Rev. 20:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu"><strong>19.</strong> Why is there a need for a final test?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> We know that Jesus resisted Satan’s efforts to make him compromise his integrity. He remained faithful under test. But will all perfect humans be willing to do so when Satan is given an opportunity to test them? Each one will be able to answer this question for himself when Satan is released from the abyss at the end of the 1,000 years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:7" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Rev. 20:7</a>) Those who prove faithful during this final test will receive everlasting life and finally enjoy true freedom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>) Those who rebel will be destroyed forever, along with the Devil and his demons.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:8-66:20:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Rev. 20:8-10</a>.</p>

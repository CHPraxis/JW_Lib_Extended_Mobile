<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHAT a wonderful day it will be when the resurrection starts here on earth during Christ’s Thousand Year Reign! All who have lost loved ones long to see them again. That is how Jehovah feels too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:15-18:14:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:15</a>) Imagine what joyous reunions will take place earth wide. As we learned in the preceding article, “the righteous,” whose names are written in the book of life, will return to “a resurrection of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 24:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 5:29</a>) Perhaps many of our loved ones will be among those restored to life early on in the earthly resurrection.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Additionally, “the unrighteous,” such as those who did not have sufficient opportunity to know Jehovah or to serve him faithfully before they died, will be raised to “a resurrection of judgment.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>2-3.</strong> (a) As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:10" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9, 10</a>, what will be the greatest educational program in all human history? (b) What will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> All these resurrected ones will need to be instructed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:9-23:26:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 26:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:11-23:61:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 61:11</a>) So the greatest educational program in all human history will need to be implemented. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 11:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Why? For one thing, the unrighteous who are resurrected will need to learn about Jesus <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Christ, the Kingdom arrangement, the ransom, and the universal issue involving Jehovah’s name and sovereignty. Even the righteous will need to be brought up-to-date with what Jehovah has progressively revealed concerning his purpose for the earth. Some of these faithful ones died long before Jehovah’s word was compiled into the Bible canon. Both the unrighteous and the righteous will have a lot to learn.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In this article, we will consider the following questions: What will be involved in implementing this great educational program? What impact will that program have on whether names are written permanently in the book of life or not? The answers to these questions should matter to us today. As we will see, some fascinating prophecies recorded in the books of Daniel and Revelation will help clarify our understanding of what will happen when the dead are resurrected. First, let us consider the exciting events foretold in the prophecy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1, 2</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>“THOSE ASLEEP IN THE DUST . . . WILL WAKE UP”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>4-5.</strong> What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a> reveal about the time of the end?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 12:1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The book of Daniel reveals the sequence of exciting events that will occur during the time of the end. For example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a> reveals that Michael, who is Jesus Christ, is “standing in behalf of [God’s] people.” That part of the prophecy began to be fulfilled in 1914 when Jesus was appointed as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> However, Daniel was also told that Jesus would “stand up” during “a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.” This “time of distress” is the “great tribulation” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>. Jesus stands up, or acts to defend God’s people, at the end of this time of distress, that is, at Armageddon. The book of Revelation refers to these ones as “a great crowd who come out of the great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> What happens after the great crowd survive the great tribulation? Explain. (See also in this issue “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2022564/">Questions From Readers</a>” regarding the resurrection to life on earth.)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 12:2</strong></a><strong>.</strong> What happens after the great crowd survive this time of distress? This prophecy is not referring to a symbolic resurrection, a spiritual revival of God’s servants that occurs during the last days, as we previously understood.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Rather, these words refer to the resurrection of the dead that takes place in the coming new world. Why can we draw that conclusion? The expression “the dust” is also used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:17:16-18:17:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 17:16</a> as a parallel of the expression “the Grave.” This fact indicates that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 12:2</a> is referring to the literal resurrection that will occur after the last days have ended and after the battle of Armageddon.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> (a) In what sense will some be resurrected to “everlasting life”? (b) How is this “a better resurrection”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 12:2</a> mean, though, <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>when it says that some will be resurrected to “everlasting life”? It means that those who are resurrected and come to know, <strong><em>or continue to know,</em></strong> and obey Jehovah and Jesus during the 1,000 years will ultimately receive everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) This will be “a better resurrection” than the one in the past that brought certain humans back to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:35-58:11:35" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Heb. 11:35</a>) Why? Because those imperfect humans died again.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How are others resurrected “to reproach and to everlasting contempt”?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> But not all resurrected ones will accept Jehovah’s educational program. Daniel’s prophecy says that some will be resurrected “to reproach and to everlasting contempt.” Because they will show a rebellious spirit, their names will not be written in the book of life and they will not receive everlasting life. Instead, they will receive “everlasting contempt,” or destruction. So <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:2-27:12:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 12:2</a> is speaking of the ultimate outcome for all resurrected ones based on what they do <strong><em>after</em></strong> their resurrection.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:12-66:20:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 20:12</a>) Some will gain everlasting life; others will not.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:38-40:13:38" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 13:38</a>) So <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:3-27:12:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 12:3</a> must be referring to the anointed and the work they will do during the Thousand Year Reign.</p>

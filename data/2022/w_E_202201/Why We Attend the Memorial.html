<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Each year, anointed ones look forward to attending the Memorial <strong><em>as partakers.</em></strong> Why do they appropriately partake of the bread and the wine? To answer that, consider what happened on the final night of Jesus’ earthly life. After the Passover meal, Jesus instituted what has come to be known as the Lord’s Evening Meal. He passed the bread and the wine to his 11 faithful apostles and told them to eat and drink. Jesus spoke to them about two covenants, or agreements​—the new covenant and the Kingdom covenant.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 28-30</a>) These covenants opened up the way for those apostles and a limited number of others to become kings and priests in heaven.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> What do the anointed recognize about the hope they have been given?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Here is another reason why the anointed are eager to attend the Memorial: This observance gives them an opportunity to <strong><em>contemplate their hope.</em></strong> Jehovah has given them a remarkable hope​—to enjoy immortal and incorruptible life in heaven, to serve alongside the glorified Jesus Christ and the rest of the 144,000 and, above all, to be in the very presence of Jehovah God! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:51-46:15:53" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:51-53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:2-62:3:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:2</a>) The anointed recognize that they have been invited to enjoy such privileges in heaven.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:7-55:4:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8</a>) It brings the anointed great joy to reflect on their heavenly hope.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> The other sheep attend the Memorial, not as partakers, but <strong><em>as observers.</em></strong> In 1938, those with the earthly hope were for the first time specifically invited to attend the Memorial. <em>The Watchtower</em> of March 1, 1938, stated: “It will be entirely right and proper for the [other sheep] to be present at such meeting and observe what is done. . . . It should be and is a time of rejoicing for them also.” Like invited guests who are happy to observe a wedding ceremony, the other sheep are happy to be present as observers at the Memorial.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> Why do the other sheep look forward to the Memorial discourse?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The other sheep too <strong><em>contemplate their hope.</em></strong> They look forward to the Memorial discourse, for much of it focuses on what Christ and his 144,000 corulers will do for faithful humans during the Thousand Year Reign. Under the leadership of their King Jesus Christ, those heavenly rulers will help transform the earth into a paradise and lift obedient humankind to perfection. How thrilling <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>it is for the millions of observers at the Memorial to imagine the future fulfillment of Bible prophecies, such as those found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 65:21-23</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Consider another reason why the other sheep attend the Memorial. They want to <strong><em>show their love and support for the anointed.</em></strong> God’s Word foretold that a close bond would exist between the anointed and those with the earthly hope. How so? Let us discuss a few examples.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong> What does the prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Zechariah 8:23</a> indicate about the way the other sheep feel about the anointed?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Zechariah 8:23</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This prophecy paints a touching picture of the way the other sheep feel about their anointed brothers and sisters. The expressions “a Jew” and “you people” refer to the same group​—the anointed remnant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 2:28, 29</a>) The “ten men out of all the languages of the nations” represent the other sheep. They “take firm hold of”​—loyally attach themselves to—​the anointed, joining them in pure worship. Naturally, then, on the night of the Memorial, the other sheep show their close attachment to the anointed by being present with them.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> What has Jehovah done in fulfillment of the prophecy found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:15-26:37:19" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:15-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:24-26:37:25" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 24, 25</a>?</p>

The prophecy mentions two sticks. Those with the heavenly hope are like the stick “for Judah” (the tribe from which the kings of Israel were chosen), and those with the earthly hope are like the stick “of Ephraim.”<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> Jehovah would unite the two groups so that they would become “one stick.” This means that they serve unitedly under their one King, Christ Jesus. Each year, the anointed and the other sheep attend the Memorial, not as two separate groups, but as “one flock” under “one shepherd.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> How do “the sheep” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:36" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 40</a> primarily show their support of Christ’s brothers?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:36" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 25:31-36,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> <strong>40</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “The sheep” in this parable represent righteous ones in the time of the end who have the earthly hope​—that is, the other sheep. They loyally support the remaining ones of Christ’s spirit-anointed brothers primarily by helping them to fulfill an enormous responsibility​—the worldwide preaching and disciple-making work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>12-13.</strong> What are some further ways in which the other sheep show their support for Christ’s brothers?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Every year in the weeks leading up to the Memorial, the other sheep show their support for Christ’s brothers by sharing fully in a global campaign to invite interested ones to the Memorial. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>(See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2022245/61-72">Are You Planning Ahead for the Memorial Season?</a>”) They also help make all the necessary arrangements so that the Memorial can be held in every congregation worldwide, even though most congregations do not have any partakers in attendance. The other sheep are thrilled to support Christ’s brothers in such ways. These sheep know that Jesus views what they do for his anointed brothers as if they were doing it for him personally.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:37-40:25:40" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 25:37-40</a>.</p>

Our God made his greatest expression of unselfish love by sending his precious Son to suffer and die for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) We recognize that Jesus too showed great love by willingly giving his life for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>) We can never repay Jehovah and Jesus for the love they have shown us.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 3:15</a>) And we attend the Memorial so that we may remember their love for us as well as show our love for them.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong> Why do both the anointed and the other sheep highly value the gift of the ransom?</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Whether our hope is to live forever in heaven or on earth, we have sound reasons to attend the Memorial. Each year when we gather together on that date, we remember the death of someone we love, Jesus Christ. Above all, we remember the greatest act of love​—the love that Jehovah showed us by giving his Son as a ransom. This year, the Memorial will be held on the evening of <strong>Friday, April 15, 2022.</strong> We love Jehovah and his Son, so on the anniversary of Jesus’ death, nothing could be more important to us than being present at the Memorial.</p>

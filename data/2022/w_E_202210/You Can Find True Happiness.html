It can last throughout a person’s life. How so? Jesus explained in his Sermon on the Mount: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) Jesus knew that humans are made with an intense desire to know and worship their Creator, Jehovah God. That is our “spiritual need.” And since Jehovah is “the happy God,” those who worship him can also be happy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Do we need ideal circumstances in our life to be happy? No. In his sermon, Jesus said something surprising. “Those who mourn”​—either because of being crushed by their sins or because of experiencing distressing circumstances in their lives—​can be happy. Jesus said the same about “those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake” or those who suffer “reproach” for being a follower of Christ.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Jesus was teaching us that happiness results, not from having ideal circumstances in our life, but from satisfying our spiritual need and drawing close to God.

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>TAKE IN SPIRITUAL FOOD</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What is the first step toward finding true happiness? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> <strong>STEP 1: <em>To be truly happy, we must take in spiritual food.</em></strong> Both humans and animals need <strong><em>physical</em></strong> food to survive. But only humans can take in <strong><em>spiritual</em></strong> food. And we need it. That is why Jesus said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) Therefore, we should not let a day go by without taking in some spiritual food from God’s precious Word, the Bible. The psalmist observed: ‘Happy is the man whose delight is in the law of Jehovah and who reads it day and night.’​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 1:1-3</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong> (a) What can we learn from the Bible? (b) In what ways can reading the Bible help us?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In the Bible, Jehovah has lovingly given us vital information on how to live a happy life. We learn what his purpose is for our life. We learn how we can draw close to him and gain his forgiveness for our sins. And we learn about the wonderful hope that he promises for the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 29:11</a>) These truths that we gain from a study of the Bible fill our heart with joy!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> As we know, the Bible is also full of practical counsel for everyday life. When we follow that counsel, we can find happiness. Whenever you feel <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>discouraged by life’s problems, spend more time reading Jehovah’s Word and meditating on it. Jesus said: “Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> How can you get the most out of the time you spend reading God’s Word?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> As you read God’s Word, take your time to savor what you read. To illustrate, have you ever had this experience? Someone cooks one of your favorite meals. But either because you are too hurried or are too preoccupied mentally, you gulp it down without really tasting each morsel. After you finish eating, you realize how quickly you ate and you wish you had slowed down and enjoyed each bite. Well, have you ever read the Bible in such haste that you failed to savor its message? Take the time to enjoy reading God’s Word; visualize the scenes, imagine the sounds of the voices, and think about what you have read. The whole experience will add to your happiness.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> How is “the faithful and discreet slave” fulfilling its role? (See also footnote.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Jesus appointed “the faithful and discreet slave” to provide spiritual food at the proper time, and we are very well-fed spiritually.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) The inspired Scriptures are the primary ingredient in everything the faithful slave produces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:13-52:2:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:13</a>) That spiritual food thus helps us to know Jehovah’s thinking as revealed in the Bible. This is why we read the <em>Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> magazines and the articles on jw.org. We prepare for the midweek and weekend congregation meetings. And we watch each monthly program on JW Broadcasting<sup>®</sup> if available. Taking in ample spiritual food will help us take the second step that leads to real happiness.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:6-20:16:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 16:6</a>) Thus, we continually strive to conform to God’s standards of right and wrong as explained in the pages of the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:1</a>) We will be happy if we do the things that Jehovah loves and reject the things that he hates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:27-19:37:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 37:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 97:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:9-45:12:9" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 12:2</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A person may <strong><em>know</em></strong> that Jehovah has the authority to decide what is right and what is wrong, but he must also <strong><em>accept</em></strong> God’s standards for himself. For example, a person may <strong><em>know</em></strong> that the government has the right to set highway speed limits. But he may not be willing to <strong><em>accept</em></strong> those limits for himself. As a result, he drives faster than he should. We show by our conduct that we truly believe that following Jehovah’s standards is the best way to live. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:28-20:12:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 12:28</a>) David felt that way, for he said of Jehovah: “You make known to me the path of life.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11-12.</strong> (a) When we are troubled or discouraged, of what must we be careful? (b) How can the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8</a> help us when choosing entertainment?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> When we are troubled or discouraged, we might feel the need for some sort of diversion to escape our problems.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In his letter to the Philippians, the apostle Paul urged Christians to continue considering things that are “righteous, . . . chaste, . . . lovable, [and] virtuous.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Although Paul was not writing specifically on the subject of entertainment, what he wrote should influence the pastimes that we choose. Try this: Wherever the generic word “things” appears in the verse, substitute it with the word “songs,” “movies,” “novels,” or “video games.” Doing this can help you to discern which ones may be acceptable in God’s view and which ones may not be. We want to bring our life into harmony with Jehovah’s lofty standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:3" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:1-3</a>) Then with a clear conscience, we can take the next step that leads to real happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:1-44:23:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 23:1</a>.</p>

Consider what happened to 19-year-old Jovidon Bobojonov, from Tajikistan, who refused to take up military service. On October 4, 2019, he was abducted from his home, kept in detention for months, and treated like a criminal. This injustice received international attention. It was reported that he was beaten in an attempt to pressure him to take a military oath of allegiance and to put on a uniform. After that, he was convicted and sent to a labor camp until finally the president of the <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>country pardoned him and ordered his release.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> While in prison, Jovidon <strong><em>took in spiritual food,</em></strong> even when he did not have a Bible or any of our publications. How was that possible? Local brothers and sisters delivered physical food to him and wrote the day’s text on the grocery bags. Thus, he was able to read the Bible and meditate on it every day. After his release from prison, he had this advice for those who have not yet faced severe trials: “It is imperative that you use your freedom to the fullest to deepen your knowledge of Jehovah by reading his Word and our publications.”</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong> On what did Jovidon focus his thoughts?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Our brother <strong><em>lived by Jehovah’s standards.</em></strong> Rather than dwell on wrong desires and get involved in bad conduct, he focused on Jehovah and on what He values. Jovidon marveled at the beauty of God’s creation. Every morning he <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>woke up to the sounds of birds chirping and singing.

In spite of the unjust treatment he received, Jovidon never did compromise. As a result, he can now greatly rejoice in having something he did not have before he was abducted, beaten, and imprisoned​—a tested faith.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

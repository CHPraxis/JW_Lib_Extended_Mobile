<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Our brothers and sisters are experiencing what the apostles endured in the first century when they were persecuted for preaching about Jesus. Repeatedly, the judges of the Jewish high court “ordered them to stop speaking on the basis of Jesus’ name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:18-44:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 4:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5:27, 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:40" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 40</a>) How did the apostles react? <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:19-44:4:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 4:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> They knew that a higher authority had ‘ordered them to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness’ about the Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>) So their spokesmen, Peter and John, boldly said that they would obey God rather than those judges and declared that they would not stop speaking about Jesus. In effect, they put this question to those authorities, ‘Do you dare to say that your commands are superior to those of God?’</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> As revealed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:29" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Acts 5:27-29</a>, what example did the apostles set for all true Christians, and how can we imitate them?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The apostles set a fine example that all true Christians have followed ever since, namely, to “obey God as ruler rather than men.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 5:27-29</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> After being beaten for keeping their integrity, the apostles went out from the Jewish high court, “rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus’] name,” and they kept right on preaching!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:42" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 5:40-42</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a>) How can we “be obedient to governments and authorities,” as the apostle Paul said, and still keep integrity to God as our foremost Ruler?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Titus 3:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong> (a) Who are “the superior authorities” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Romans 13:1</a>, and what obligation do we have toward them? (b) What is true of all human rulers?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 13:1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> In this verse, the term “superior authorities” refers to human rulers who have power and control over others. Christians are subject to these secular authorities. These rulers maintain public order, enforce the law, and at times even come to the defense of Jehovah’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:16-66:12:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:16</a>) Thus, we are commanded to render them the taxes, tributes, fear, and honor that they demand. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:7-45:13:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 13:7</a>) However, those secular governments have authority only because Jehovah allows them to have it. Jesus made that principle clear when he was interrogated by Roman Governor Pontius Pilate. When Pilate referred to the authority he had either to spare Jesus’ life or to have him put to death, Jesus told him: “You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:11-43:19:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 19:11</a>) As was the case with Pilate, the authority of all human rulers and politicians today is limited.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong> In what situations must we not submit to human rulers, and of what should they be aware?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Christians submit to human governments when secular laws do not contradict God’s laws. But we cannot obey men when they require what God forbids or when they forbid what God requires. For example, they may require young men to fight in the armed forces of the nation.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Or they may ban our Bible and our Bible-based publications and forbid us to preach and to worship together.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong> What is the difference between “superior” and “supreme,” and why does this matter?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The word “superior” means “better, greater, higher in rank.” But it does not mean “best, greatest, highest in rank.” That describes another word​—“supreme.” Even though human governments are referred to as “the superior authorities,” there exists another authority that is the highest in rank​—supreme. Four times in the Bible, Jehovah God is given the title “the Supreme One.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:18-27:7:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 7:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:22-27:7:22" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:25-27:7:25" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 27</a>.</p>

<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu"><strong>18.</strong> What have many true Christians been willing to do, and why? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:28-27:3:28" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Daniel 3:28</a>)</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Over the centuries, many true Christians have risked their freedom and even their lives out of love for Jehovah as their Sovereign Ruler. They are integrity-keepers, who have resolve like that of the three Hebrews whose lives were spared in the fiery furnace for remaining faithful to the Supreme One.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:28-27:3:28" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 3:28</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"><strong>19.</strong> On what basis will Jehovah judge his people, and what does this require of us now?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> The psalmist David wrote about the importance of keeping integrity to God: “Jehovah will pass sentence on the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:8-19:7:8" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 7:8</a>) Again, David wrote: “May integrity and uprightness safeguard me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:21-19:25:21" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 25:21</a>) The best way to live is to remain faithful to Jehovah, maintaining our loyalty to him no matter what comes our way! Then we will feel the same as did the psalmist who wrote: “Happy are those who keep integrity . . . , who walk in the law of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:1" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 119:1</a>, ftn.</p>

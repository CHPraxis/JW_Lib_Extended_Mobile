<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>11</strong></span> “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>12</strong></span> Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>13</strong></span> “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltiness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>14</strong></span> “You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when located on a mountain. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>15</strong></span> People light a lamp and set it, not under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>16</strong></span> Likewise, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>17</strong></span> “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>18</strong></span> Truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>19</strong></span> Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>20</strong></span> For I say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>21</strong></span> “You heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not murder, but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>22</strong></span> However, I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·henʹna.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>25</strong></span> “Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent, while you are with him on the way there, so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>26</strong></span> I say to you for a fact, you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>27</strong></span> “You heard that it was said: ‘You must not commit adultery.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>28</strong></span> But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>29</strong></span> If, now, your right eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>31</strong></span> “Moreover, it was said: ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>32</strong></span> However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality,<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span id="footnotesource7" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span> makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>33</strong></span> “Again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>34</strong></span> However, I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>35</strong></span> nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>36</strong></span> Do not swear by your head, since you cannot turn one hair white or black. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>37</strong></span> Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes, your ‘No,’ no, for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>38</strong></span> “You heard that it was said: ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>39</strong></span> However, I say to you: Do not resist the one who is wicked, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>40</strong></span> And if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment, let him also have your outer garment; <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>41</strong></span> and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile, go with him two miles. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>42</strong></span> Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow<span data-fnid="8" class="fn">h<span id="footnotesource8" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="8"></span></span> from you.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>43</strong></span> “You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>44</strong></span> However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>45</strong></span> so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>46</strong></span> For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>47</strong></span> And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>48</strong></span> You must accordingly be perfect,<span data-fnid="9" class="fn">i<span id="footnotesource9" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="9"></span></span> as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="du-fontSize--basePlus3 du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>6</strong></span> “Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them; otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>2</strong></span> So when you make gifts of mercy,<span data-fnid="10" class="fn">j<span id="footnotesource10" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="10"></span></span> do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>3</strong></span> But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>4</strong></span> so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>5</strong></span> “Also, when you pray, do not act like the hypocrites, for they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the main streets to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>6</strong></span> But when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>7</strong></span> When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>8</strong></span> So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>9</strong></span> “You must pray, then, this way:</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">“‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.<span data-fnid="11" class="fn">k<span id="footnotesource11" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="11"></span></span> <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>10</strong></span> Let your Kingdom come.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>14</strong></span> “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>15</strong></span> whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>16</strong></span> “When you fast, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces<span data-fnid="13" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource13" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="13"></span></span> so they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>17</strong></span> But you, when fasting, put oil on your head and wash your face, <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>18</strong></span> so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>19</strong></span> “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>20</strong></span> Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>21</strong></span> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>25</strong></span> “On this account I say to you: Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>26</strong></span> Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>27</strong></span> Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>28</strong></span> Also, why are you anxious about clothing? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin; <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>29</strong></span> but I tell you that not even Solʹo·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>30</strong></span> Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>31</strong></span> So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to wear?’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>32</strong></span> For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>33</strong></span> “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>34</strong></span> So never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span class="du-fontSize--basePlus3 du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>7</strong></span> “Stop judging that you may not be judged; <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>2</strong></span> for with the judgment you are judging, you will be judged, and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>3</strong></span> Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>4</strong></span> Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the straw from your eye,’ when look! a rafter is in your own eye? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>5</strong></span> Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother’s eye.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>6</strong></span> “Do not give what is holy to dogs nor throw your pearls before swine, so that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>12</strong></span> “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them. This, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.</p>

Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>17</strong></span> Likewise, every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>18</strong></span> A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>19</strong></span> Every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>20</strong></span> Really, then, by their fruits you will recognize those men.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>21</strong></span> “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>22</strong></span> Many will say to me in that day: ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>23</strong></span> And then I will declare to them: ‘I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!’</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>24</strong></span> “Therefore, everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does them will be like a discreet man who built his house on the rock. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>25</strong></span> And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded on the rock. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>26</strong></span> Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>27</strong></span> And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>28</strong></span> When Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching, <span class="du-fontFamily--sansSerif"><strong>29</strong></span> for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.</p>

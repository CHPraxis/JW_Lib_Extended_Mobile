(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) So through him we have come to know and love Jehovah God.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Shortly after Jesus was installed as Messianic King in 1914, Satan was cast out of heaven. He is now confined to the vicinity of the earth, awaiting his destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 12</a>) But he is not waiting passively. Satan is desperate and furious, venting his anger on God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:13-66:12:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 12:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 17</a>) For that reason, the world’s hatred of God’s people has intensified. We have no reason, though, to fear Satan and his followers. Instead, we can have the same conviction as did the apostle Paul, who wrote: “If God is for us, who will be against us?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:31-45:8:31" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rom. 8:31</a>) We can have complete confidence in Jehovah because, as we have seen, much of the prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> has already been fulfilled.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>16-18.</strong> How have Curtis, Ursula, and Jessica benefited from their understanding of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s promise found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> can help us to cope with whatever trials come our way. Curtis, who serves as a missionary in Guam, says: “At times, I have dealt with trials and disappointments that tested my devotion <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>to Jehovah. But meditating on the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> has helped me to maintain my trust in my heavenly Father.” Curtis looks forward to the day when Jehovah will bring an end to all our trials.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> A sister in Bavaria named Ursula says that understanding <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> helped to convince her that the Bible is inspired of God. She saw how all the other prophecies are connected to this prophecy, and that deeply impressed her. She also says: “I was touched when I learned that Jehovah took action immediately so that mankind would not be left without hope.”</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Jessica, from Micronesia, says: “I can still remember how I felt when I first realized that I had found the truth! The prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> was being fulfilled. It has helped me to remember that what we are experiencing today is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the real life. This prophecy has also strengthened my belief that serving Jehovah results in the best possible life I can have now and an even better life in the future.”</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>19.</strong> What confidence can we have that the final part of the prophecy will be fulfilled?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> As we have seen, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> is now undergoing fulfillment. The offspring of the woman and the offspring of the serpent have been clearly identified. Jesus, the primary part of the offspring of the woman, recovered from his heel wound and is now a glorious, immortal King. The selection of those making up the secondary part of the offspring is nearing completion. Because the first part of the prophecy has been fulfilled, we have every reason to be confident that the final part, the crushing of the serpent’s head, will also come true. What a relief it will be for faithful mankind when Satan comes to his end! Until then, do not give up. Our God is trustworthy. Through the offspring of the woman, he will bring countless blessings to “all nations of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>.</p>

Family ties are fraying. People in general are becoming more and more violent, selfish, and aggressive. Many find it difficult to trust those in authority. But these very conditions can give you confidence. Why? Because people are acting exactly as was foretold in a remarkable prophecy about “the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) The fulfillment of this prophecy, which is impossible for any sincere person to deny, provides evidence that Christ Jesus has begun ruling as King of God’s Kingdom. But this is only one of many prophecies concerning the Kingdom. It will be faith-strengthening for us to review other prophecies that have been fulfilled in recent years.</p>

Among other things, he mentioned wars, famines, and earthquakes. He also foretold that there would be pestilences, or diseases, “in one place after another”​—of which the recent COVID-19 pandemic is an example.

Jesus’ earthly enemies would include the final world power foretold in the Bible, the one represented by the “feet of iron and of clay.” This world power has already appeared. It came into existence during World War I when Britain and the United States forged a special partnership, the Anglo-American alliance. Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image also foretold at least two things about <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>this world power that would distinguish it from the previous kingdoms.</p>

Furthermore, he revealed that the Anglo-American World Power would be the last of these.

World leaders wanted to ensure future world peace. So in January 1920, they established the League of Nations, which was replaced by the United Nations in October 1945. This organization is called “an eighth king.” But it is not a world power. Its strength and influence depend on the political powers that support it.

What does the vision reveal? False religious organizations have long cooperated closely with the world’s political powers and have given them their blessing. Soon, however, Jehovah will put it into the hearts of the political powers “to carry out his thought.” With what result? Those political powers, the “ten kings,” will turn <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>on false religious organizations and destroy them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 17:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:17" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p>

To answer that question, it is helpful to remember that the ancient city of Babylon was partly protected by the waters of the mighty Euphrates River.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong> How should we view the opportunity to pray to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WE HAVE been granted a marvelous privilege​—that of approaching the Maker of heaven and earth in prayer. Just think: We can pour out our hearts to Jehovah at any time and in any language, without needing to make an appointment. We can pray to him from a hospital bed or from a prison cell, confident that our loving Father will listen to us. We do not take this privilege for granted.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong> How did King David show that he treasured the privilege of prayer?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> King David treasured the privilege of prayer. He sang to Jehovah: “May my prayer be as incense prepared before you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:1-19:141:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 141:1, 2</a>) In David’s time, the sacred incense used in true worship by the priests was prepared with great care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 30:34, 35</a>) David’s reference to incense suggests that he wanted to give careful thought to what he was going to say to his heavenly Father. That is our earnest desire too. We want our prayers to please Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What should be our attitude when we approach Jehovah in prayer, and why?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> When we pray to Jehovah, we should avoid being overly familiar. Instead, we pray with an attitude of deep respect. Think about the amazing visions that Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and John received. Those visions differ one from the other, but they have something in common. They all depict Jehovah as a majestic King. Isaiah “saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 6:<span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>1-3</a>) Ezekiel saw Jehovah seated on his celestial chariot, surrounded by “a brilliance . . . like that of a rainbow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:26-26:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:26-28</a>) Daniel saw “the Ancient of Days” clothed in white garments, with flames of fire coming from His throne. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9, 10</a>) And John saw Jehovah seated on a throne surrounded by something like a beautiful emerald-green rainbow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:2-66:4:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 4:2-4</a>) As we reflect on Jehovah’s incomparable glory, we are reminded of the incredible privilege of approaching him in prayer and the importance of doing so with reverence. But how should we pray?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong> What do we learn from the opening words of the model prayer found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.</strong> In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught his disciples how to pray in a way that pleases God. After saying “you must pray, then, this way,” Jesus first mentioned important matters that are directly related to Jehovah’s purpose: the sanctification of His name; the coming of the Kingdom, which will destroy all of God’s opposers; and the future blessings that He has in mind for the earth and for mankind. By including such matters in our prayers, we show that God’s will is important to us.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong> Is it proper for us to pray about personal matters?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In the next part of the prayer, Jesus showed that it is proper to pray about personal matters. We can ask Jehovah to give us our food for the day, to forgive us for our sins, to protect us from temptation, and to deliver us from the wicked one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:11-40:6:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 6:11-13</a>) When we ask Jehovah for these things, we are acknowledging our dependence on him and expressing our desire to obtain his approval.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jesus did not expect his followers to adhere rigidly to the wording of the model prayer. In other prayers that <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Jesus offered, he mentioned different matters that were of concern to him at the time.

When we have a decision to make, we can pray for wisdom and understanding. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:33-19:119:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 119:33, 34</a>) When we are about to begin a difficult assignment, we can pray for insight and discernment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:6-20:2:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 2:6</a>) Parents can pray for their children, children can pray for their parents, and all of us can and should pray for our Bible students and for those to whom we preach.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We should remember to <strong><em>praise</em></strong> Jehovah in our prayers. No one deserves praise more than our God. He is “good and ready to forgive.” He is also “merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and faithfulness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:15-19:86:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15</a>) We certainly have good reason to praise Jehovah for who he is and for what he does.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> In addition to praising Jehovah in our prayers, we are moved to <strong><em>thank</em></strong> him for the marvelous things he provides. For instance, we can thank him for the magnificent colors seen in flowers, the endless variety of delicious food, and the refreshing company of dear friends. Our loving Father gives us this and much more, just to make us happy. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:12-19:104:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 104:12-15,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <strong>24</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Even more important, we thank Jehovah for the abundant spiritual food he provides and for the marvelous hope we have for the future.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> It can be so easy to forget to thank Jehovah for all that he does for us.

Likewise, when we remember to thank Jehovah for answering our prayers, it warms his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Col. 3:15</a>) What, though, is another important reason to thank our God?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong> According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>, why do we have reason to thank Jehovah for sending Jesus to the earth?</p>

We learn so much about Jehovah and about how to please him by studying the life of Jesus. If we exercise faith in the sacrifice of Christ, we can have a warm, personal relationship with Jehovah God and enjoy peace with Him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rom. 5:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong> What role does Jesus play in our prayers to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> We thank Jehovah that we can pray to him through his Son. Jesus is the channel that Jehovah uses to grant our requests. Jehovah listens to and answers prayers that are offered in Jesus’ name. Jesus explained: “Whatever you ask in my name, I will do this, so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:13-43:14:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 14:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Jehovah forgives our sins on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. The Scriptures describe Jesus as our “high priest [sitting] at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Heb. 8:1</a>) Jesus is our “helper with the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>) How thankful we are to Jehovah for providing us with a sympathetic High Priest who understands our weaknesses and who “pleads for us”!

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> In imitation of Jesus, we do not focus only on our own needs. Instead, we regularly pray for our brothers and sisters. When we do that, we are obeying Jesus’ command to love one another and we show Jehovah just how much we love our fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:34" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 13:34</a>) Praying for our brothers and sisters is not a waste of time.

We can ask Jehovah to help them to endure sickness, natural disasters, civil war, persecution, or other difficulties. We can also pray for our self-sacrificing brothers and sisters who provide relief for those in need. You may personally know some who are facing such challenges. Why not mention them by name in your personal prayers? We show genuine brotherly love by asking Jehovah to help them to endure.</p>

For example, a sister who is conducting a Bible study may ask the sister who has accompanied her to offer a prayer.

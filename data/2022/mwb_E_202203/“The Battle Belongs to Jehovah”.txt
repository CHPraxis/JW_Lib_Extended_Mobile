David facing Goliath



TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“The Battle Belongs to Jehovah”




David’s faith in Jehovah was based on knowledge and experience (1Sa 17:36, 37; wp16.5 11 ¶2-3)
David looked at Goliath in comparison to Jehovah, not himself (1Sa 17:45-47; wp16.5 11-12)
Jehovah gave David the victory over an imposing enemy (1Sa 17:48-50; wp16.5 12 ¶4; see cover picture)





At times, we may face huge challenges, such as persecution or a bad habit. When problems seem too big, remember that they are small in comparison to Jehovah’s limitless power.​—Job 42:1, 2.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David defeated Goliath because he relied on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 17:45</a>) Jehovah wants to show his strength in behalf of all his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ch 16:9</a>) How can we rely on the help that Jehovah provides rather than on our own experience and abilities? Here are three ways:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">  <strong>Pray often.</strong> Pray not just for forgiveness after making a mistake but also for strength when facing a temptation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 6:12, 13</a>) Pray not just for Jehovah’s blessing on decisions that have already been made but also for his direction and wisdom <em>before</em> making decisions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas 1:5</a></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  <strong>Have a routine of Bible reading and study.</strong> Read the Bible every day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 1:2</a>) Ponder over Bible examples, and apply the lessons learned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:23-59:1:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas 1:23-25</a>) Prepare for the ministry instead of relying on personal experience. Benefit fully from congregation meetings by considering the material in advance</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  <strong>Cooperate with Jehovah’s organization.</strong> Keep up-to-date with direction from the organization, and then follow through promptly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:17-4:9:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nu 9:17</a>) Listen to the elders when they give counsel and instructions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb 13:17</a></p>

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Obedience Is Better Than a Sacrifice




Jehovah’s prophet gave King Saul specific instructions (1Sa 15:3)
Saul tried to justify not obeying Jehovah fully (1Sa 15:13-15)
Jehovah does not accept worship from those who are disobedient (1Sa 15:22, 23; w07 6/15 26 ¶4; it-2 521 ¶2)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘Do I obey instructions from Jehovah’s organization promptly and completely?’

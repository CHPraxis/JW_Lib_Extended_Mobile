TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Remain Humble When Successful




David received praise from the people (1Sa 18:5-7; w04 4/1 15 ¶4)
Jehovah gave David success in all he did (1Sa 18:14)
David remained humble (1Sa 18:22, 23; w18.01 28 ¶6-7)





Why is it important for us to remain humble when we receive blessings from Jehovah? What will help us to remain humble?

How to Be a Good Friend




Comfort and encourage your friend when he is distressed (1Sa 20:1, 2; w19.11 7 ¶18)
Warn your friend when there is danger (1Sa 20:12, 13; w08 2/15 8 ¶7)
Defend your friend when he is slandered (1Sa 20:30-32; w09 10/15 19 ¶11)





Jehovah’s people have many opportunities to develop good friendships. To have a friend, we must be a friend. Whom would you like to befriend in the congregation?

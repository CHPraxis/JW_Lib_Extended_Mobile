LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
All Trials Have an Expiration Date




Trials can easily discourage us, especially when they are prolonged. David knew that his trial involving King Saul would eventually end and that he would become king, as Jehovah had promised. (1Sa 16:13) David’s faith helped him to be patient and wait on Jehovah.
When under trial, we may be able to use shrewdness, knowledge, or thinking ability to change our situation. (1Sa 21:12-14; Pr 1:4) However, some difficulties will persist even after we have done all we can in harmony with Bible principles. In such cases, we must exercise patience and wait on Jehovah. Soon he will end all our suffering and “wipe out every tear” from our eyes. (Re 21:4) Whether our relief comes as a result of Jehovah’s intervention or because of other reasons, one thing is certain: All trials have an expiration date. This fact can give us a measure of comfort.

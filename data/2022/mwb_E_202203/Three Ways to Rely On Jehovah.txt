LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Three Ways to Rely On Jehovah




David defeated Goliath because he relied on Jehovah. (1Sa 17:45) Jehovah wants to show his strength in behalf of all his servants. (2Ch 16:9) How can we rely on the help that Jehovah provides rather than on our own experience and abilities? Here are three ways:
  Pray often. Pray not just for forgiveness after making a mistake but also for strength when facing a temptation. (Mt 6:12, 13) Pray not just for Jehovah’s blessing on decisions that have already been made but also for his direction and wisdom before making decisions.​—Jas 1:5

  Have a routine of Bible reading and study. Read the Bible every day. (Ps 1:2) Ponder over Bible examples, and apply the lessons learned. (Jas 1:23-25) Prepare for the ministry instead of relying on personal experience. Benefit fully from congregation meetings by considering the material in advance

  Cooperate with Jehovah’s organization. Keep up-to-date with direction from the organization, and then follow through promptly. (Nu 9:17) Listen to the elders when they give counsel and instructions.​—Heb 13:17

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Do You Act on Impulse?




David’s reasonable request was met with insults (1Sa 25:7-11; ia 78 ¶10-12)
David’s impulse was to kill the men of Nabal’s household (1Sa 25:13, 21, 22)
Abigail helped David to avoid bloodguilt (1Sa 25:25, 26, 32, 33; ia 80 ¶18)
ASK YOURSELF: ‘Do I tend to act on impulse when I am angry, when I am shopping, or when I am discouraged? Or do I pause to consider the consequences before I act?’​—Pr 15:28; 22:3.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Only those who are morally clean can enjoy a close relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:14-60:1:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Pe 1:14-16</a>) As Bible students conquer bad habits, they may also experience family, health, and financial benefits.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Clearly explain Jehovah’s moral standards, the reasons for them, and the benefits of following them. Focus on helping your students to change their pattern of thinking, and their actions will follow. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph 4:22-24</a>) Assure them that with Jehovah’s help they <em>can</em> overcome an ingrained bad habit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Php 4:13</a>) Teach them to supplicate Jehovah when they experience the urge to sin. Help them to recognize tempting situations that they should avoid. Encourage them to replace unclean habits with wholesome activities. Joy results from seeing Bible students succeed in making changes with Jehovah’s help.</p>

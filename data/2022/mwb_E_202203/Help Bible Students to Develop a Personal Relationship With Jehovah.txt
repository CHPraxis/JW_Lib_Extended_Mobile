Help Bible Students to Develop a Personal Relationship With Jehovah




Jehovah wants us to serve him out of love. (Mt 22:37, 38) It is love for God that will empower Bible students to make needed changes and stand firm under trial. (1Jo 5:3) It is their love for God that will motivate them to get baptized.
Help your students to see God’s love for them. Ask such questions as: “What does this teach you about Jehovah?” or “How does this show God’s love for you?” Help them to perceive how Jehovah is helping them personally. (2Ch 16:9) Share examples of how Jehovah has answered your specific prayers, and encourage them to notice how Jehovah answers theirs. Great joy results from seeing Bible students respond to Jehovah’s love and demonstrate their strong attachment to him.

Presumptuousness Leads to Dishonor




King Saul felt that he was in a desperate situation (1Sa 13:5-7)
Rather than modestly following Jehovah’s instructions, Saul acted presumptuously (1Sa 13:8, 9; w00 8/1 13 ¶17)
Jehovah disciplined Saul (1Sa 13:13, 14; w07 6/15 27 ¶8)
Someone acts presumptuously when he rashly or foolishly does something that he is not authorized to do. Presumptuousness is contrasted with modesty. What situations could tempt someone to be presumptuous?

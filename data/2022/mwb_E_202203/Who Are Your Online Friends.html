<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A friend is defined as “one attached to another by affection or esteem.” For example, Jonathan and David began an unbreakable friendship after David killed Goliath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:1-9:18:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Sa 18:1</a>) Each man displayed qualities that endeared him to the other. Therefore, strong friendships are based on accurate knowledge. Getting to know another person generally takes time and effort. However, on social networks, people can become “friends” with just the click of a mouse. Because people online are able to plan exactly what to say and control to some extent how others view them, it is easy for them to hide who they really are. Therefore, it is good to have an online ‘friending policy.’ Do not be afraid to ignore or reject friend requests from people you do not really know for fear of hurting their feelings. In view of the potential dangers, some have chosen not to use social networks at all. However, if you choose to use a social network, what should you keep in mind?</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Creation Strengthens Our Trust in Jehovah’s Wisdom




Does Jehovah always know what is best for us? Absolutely! Believing this, we show wisdom when we follow his direction. (Pr 16:3, 9) However, our trust in his guidance may be tested when it differs from our own thinking. We can strengthen our trust in Jehovah’s wisdom by meditating on his creative works.​—Pr 30:24, 25; Ro 1:20.

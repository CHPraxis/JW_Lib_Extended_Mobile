LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Be Assured of Jehovah’s Loyal Love




Jehovah views you as precious. (Isa 43:4) He has drawn you to him and his organization. As a result of your dedication and baptism, you belong to Jehovah. He will take care of you as his special property, even when times are tough. He will show loyal love to you through his organization.​—Ps 25:10.
We can deepen our appreciation for Jehovah’s loyal love by reviewing how his organization has responded to natural disasters in recent times.

Pursue Loyal Love




[Play the video Introduction to Ruth.]
Naomi urged Orpah and Ruth to return to Moab (Ru 1:8-13; w16.02 14 ¶5)

Loyal love is motivated by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment. Jehovah demonstrates loyal love to his faithful servants. (Ps 63:3) We too should show loyal love to others.​—Pr 21:21.

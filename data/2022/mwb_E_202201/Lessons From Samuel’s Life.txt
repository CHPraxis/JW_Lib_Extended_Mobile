LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Lessons From Samuel’s Life




Samuel remained faithful to Jehovah throughout his life. As a boy, he refused to become corrupt like Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas. (1Sa 2:22-26) Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah remained with him. (1Sa 3:19) As an older man, he continued to walk in Jehovah’s way, even though his sons did not.​—1Sa 8:1-5.
What can Samuel’s example teach us? If you are a young person, be confident that Jehovah understands the challenges you face and how you feel. He can help you to be courageous. (Isa 41:10, 13) If you are a parent whose child has gone astray, find comfort in knowing that Samuel could not force his adult sons to remain loyal to Jehovah’s standards. While leaving the matter in Jehovah’s hands, he maintained his own integrity and pleased his heavenly Father, Jehovah. Perhaps your good example will move your child to return to Jehovah.

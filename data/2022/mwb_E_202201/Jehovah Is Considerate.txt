TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Is Considerate




Samuel thought that Eli was calling him (1Sa 3:4-7; w18.09 24 ¶3)
Jehovah made it clear that He was calling Samuel (1Sa 3:8, 9)
Jehovah showed kind consideration for young Samuel (1Sa 3:15-18; w18.09 24 ¶4)
ASK YOURSELF: ‘In what ways can I show consideration for younger ones and older ones? How can I show consideration for others at Christian meetings?’

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 22:22</a>) All who gather to worship Jehovah find joy and blessings.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can you help your Bible students to attend meetings? Keep inviting them to attend. Show them the video <a data-video="webpubvid://?pub=whkh&amp;" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014315&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</em></a> Explain the benefits of the meetings. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="58" href="jwpub://p/E:1102021210/"><em>lff</em> lesson 10</a>) You might share a specific point that you have learned at a meeting or preview what will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. Give your students the publications that will be used. Also, offer practical help. Maybe they need a ride. Any effort you make will be well worth it when your student attends a meeting for the first time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:24-46:14:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Co 14:24, 25</a>.</p>

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Keep Inquiring of Jehovah




The Israelites repeatedly asked Jehovah for direction (Jg 20:17, 18, 23; w11 9/15 32 ¶2)
The Israelites finally relied fully on Jehovah to help them clear his name of reproach (Jg 20:26-28)
We must continue to seek Jehovah’s guidance and rely on him completely (Jg 20:35; Lu 11:9; w11 9/15 32 ¶4)





ASK YOURSELF: ‘When facing a trial, do I immediately turn to Jehovah? Do I repeatedly look to him for wisdom and guidance?’

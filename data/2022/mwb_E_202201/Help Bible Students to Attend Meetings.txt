Help Bible Students to Attend Meetings




Congregation meetings are a vital part of pure worship. (Ps 22:22) All who gather to worship Jehovah find joy and blessings. (Ps 65:4) Bible students usually progress more rapidly when they attend meetings regularly.
How can you help your Bible students to attend meetings? Keep inviting them to attend. Show them the video What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? Explain the benefits of the meetings. (lff lesson 10) You might share a specific point that you have learned at a meeting or preview what will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. Give your students the publications that will be used. Also, offer practical help. Maybe they need a ride. Any effort you make will be well worth it when your student attends a meeting for the first time.​—1Co 14:24, 25.

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Who Is Your King?




The Israelites presumptuously requested a human king (1Sa 8:4, 5; it-2 163 ¶1)
The Israelites were not content to have Jehovah as their invisible Ruler (1Sa 8:7, 8; w11 1/1 27 ¶1)
Jehovah warned them of the consequences of their request (1Sa 8:9, 18; w10 1/15 30 ¶9)
Jehovah has always exercised his sovereignty over all his creation. His rulership is kind and dignifies his subjects. Our obeying and supporting his rulership will result in eternal blessings.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How am I showing in my personal life that I submit to Jehovah’s way of ruling?’

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Young Ones​—Open Your Heart to Your Parents




Why should you try to share your thoughts openly with your parents? (Pr 23:26) Because Jehovah has charged them with caring for you and guiding you. (Ps 127:3, 4) It would be hard for them to help you if you kept all your cares and worries concealed from them. Also, you would miss out on the practical experience that they have gained in life. Is it wrong to keep some thoughts to yourself? Not necessarily​—as long as you are not deceitful.​—Pr 3:32.
How can you talk to your parents? Try picking a time that is good for you and them. If that is a challenge, you could write one of them a letter to share your feelings. What if they want to talk about a subject that you prefer not to discuss? Remember that they really want to help. Think of your parents as allies, not enemies. The effort you put forth to communicate openly with your parents will benefit you for the rest of your life​—everlasting life!​—Pr 4:10-12.

How Awake! Saved His Life
“I DID not want to continue to be a burden on my family, so I decided that suicide would be the answer.” So writes a man in Nepal. He continues: “I prepared a rope and decided the place and date. But just a week before that day, I received the February 22, 2000, issue of Awake!”
The cover series for that issue was “Suicide—Who Are Most at Risk?” The man writes: “It took all my strength to pick it up and all the courage I had to read it. The explanation of the ten risk factors for suicide deeply impressed me and made me change my mind.” He concluded: “I cannot hold back from expressing my appreciation for what you have done for me. Your work of writing this article saved my life!”
Many factors are involved in today’s escalating suicide rates. One is the lack of purpose in life that so many feel. The brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? has helped many to appreciate that there truly is hope of a better life.

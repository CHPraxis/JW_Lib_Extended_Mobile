<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I DID not want to continue to be a burden on my family, so I decided that suicide would be the answer.” So writes a man in Nepal. He continues: “I prepared a rope and decided the place and date. But just a week before that day, I received the February 22, 2000, issue of <em>Awake!”</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The cover series for that issue was “Suicide—Who Are Most at Risk?” The man writes: “It took all my strength to pick it up and all the courage I had to read it. The explanation of the ten risk factors for suicide deeply impressed me and made me change my mind.” He concluded: “I cannot hold back from expressing my appreciation for what you have done for me. Your work of writing this article saved my life!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many factors are involved in today’s escalating suicide rates. One is the lack of purpose in life that so many feel. The brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>has helped many to appreciate that there truly is hope of a better life.

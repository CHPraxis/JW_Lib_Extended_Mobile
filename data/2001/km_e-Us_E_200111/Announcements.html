<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting the <em>2002 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>with their November literature request. The <em>Yearbook </em>will be available in Albanian, Arabic, Cebuano, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Iloko, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Tagalog.

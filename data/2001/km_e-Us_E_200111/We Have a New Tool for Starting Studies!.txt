We Have a New Tool for Starting Studies!
1 The American woman was a devout Roman Catholic. She faithfully defended the church’s teachings. She even made a pilgrimage to the Vatican. And yet, when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her door, she accepted the offer of a home Bible study. Why? Because she wanted to learn what the Bible says and her church did not offer a home Bible study. What does this experience teach us? That we never know who is likely to accept a free Bible study.​—Eccl. 11:6.
2 Have you ever hesitated to tell people that we are willing to study the Bible with anyone who is interested? Does everyone in your community know that we offer this free service? How can we make sure that they do? By making use of a new tool! It is an attractive, six-page tract entitled Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? Let’s get acquainted with this tract, subheading by subheading.
3 “Why Read the Bible?” The reasons that the tract gives are very appealing. It explains that the Bible contains “loving instruction from God,” showing how to approach him in prayer for help and how to receive his gift of everlasting life. (1 Thess. 2:13) The tract refers to various Bible “truths that give enlightenment,” such as what happens after we die and why there is so much trouble on earth. It describes “godly principles in the Bible” that when applied bring physical benefits and promote happiness, hope, and other desirable qualities. The tract refers to one more reason for reading the Bible​—the prophecies about the future that show what is just ahead of us.​—Rev. 21:3, 4.
4 “Help in Understanding the Bible”: The tract states: “All of us need help in understanding God’s Word.” Then it describes our method of studying the Bible: “Usually it is best to study the Bible progressively, beginning with basic teachings.” While making it plain that “the Bible is the authority,” the tract specifically mentions the Require brochure as something that will help the student “to understand Scriptural references on a variety of subjects.” The next subheading raises a compelling question.
5 “Are You Willing to Spend Time Each Week to Understand the Bible?” The tract explains that the Bible study can be arranged at a time and place convenient for the student, either in the privacy of his or her own home or even over the telephone. Who can share in the discussion? The tract answers: “Your entire family. Any friends that you choose to invite may also share. Or if you prefer, the discussion can be held with just you.” For how long must one study? It explains: “Many set aside an hour each week to study the Bible. If you are able to spend more time or are limited to less time each week, the Witnesses will make themselves available to help you.” There is the key! We are willing to adjust to the circumstances of each student.
6 “An Invitation to Learn”: A coupon is provided on which the recipient of the tract can request the Require brochure or a visit to explain our free home Bible study program. The cover of the Require brochure is shown in full color. Can you not see why this tract will encourage more honesthearted ones to accept our help? Now, how can we make the best use of this new tool?
7 To Whom Can You Offer the Tract? The tract can be handed to people in person or left at not-at-homes. It can be distributed from house to house, on the street, and in business territory. Offer it to people whether they accept our literature or refuse it. Insert it into the magazines or other publications that are placed. Enclose it when you are writing letters. Offer to mail it to those whom you contact by telephone. Always have copies with you to distribute when shopping, when using public transportation, and when witnessing informally. Give it to anyone who calls at your door. Offer it to your relatives, neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and other acquaintances. Endeavor to get this tract into the hands of everyone you meet! Then what?
8 If the Response Is Immediate: Some individuals will respond immediately by saying that they would like to have a Bible study. Therefore, whenever engaged in field service activity, be sure you always have two copies of the Require brochure​—one for the student and one for yourself. If the person is willing, start the study right then and there. Open to the inside cover, and read “How to Use This Brochure.” Then go right to lesson 1, and demonstrate the study. What could be easier?
9 If Your Listener Needs Time to Think About It: Before too much time elapses, endeavor to contact him again. When you do, be sure to have the Require brochure with you. Show him the table of contents on the inside cover. Let him pick the subject that looks the most interesting to him. Turn to it, and begin discussing the lesson he chose.
10 Following Up Magazine Placements: If you left the tract along with a set of magazines, you might return with this approach: “The last time I called, I was pleased to leave with you a copy of the Watchtower magazine. Perhaps you noticed that the full title of the journal is The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. Today I would like to explain what this Kingdom is and what it will mean for you and your family.” Then open the Require brochure to lesson 6. Beginning with the first paragraph, read and discuss as much as the householder has time for. Then make arrangements to return another day and finish the lesson.
11 Do Not Run Out of Tracts: The service overseer and the brothers who handle literature supplies will want to keep an ample supply of the Know the Bible tract on hand at all times in the congregation. Keep some in your pocket or purse, in your car, at your workplace, at school, near the entrance to your home​—wherever they will be handy. Of course, carry some in your witnessing case for those times when you meet someone with whom you can converse about the Bible.
12 May Jehovah Bless Our Efforts: A desirable goal for all Christians is to teach the truth to someone else. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Are you currently conducting a home Bible study? If you are, can you find time for another one in your weekly schedule? If you are not now conducting a study, surely you wish you were. Pray for Jehovah to bless your efforts to find someone with whom you can study. Then work in harmony with those prayers.​—1 John 5:14, 15.
13 We have a new tool for starting studies! Get familiar with it. Distribute it freely. Do all you can “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share” what you have learned about the Word of God.​—1 Tim. 6:18.

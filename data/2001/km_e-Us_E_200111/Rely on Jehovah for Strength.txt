Rely on Jehovah for Strength
1 For many reasons, we need to rely on Jehovah. Preaching the good news “in all the inhabited earth” is a daunting assignment. (Matt. 24:14) Constantly, we battle with our imperfect flesh. (Rom. 7:21-23) Moreover, “we have a wrestling . . . against the [superhuman] world rulers of this darkness.” (Eph. 6:11, 12) Clearly, we need help. How can we gain strength from Jehovah?
2 By Prayer: Jehovah freely gives his powerful holy spirit to his servants who ask for it. (Luke 11:13) Do you lack confidence in your ability to witness from house to house, on the street, or over the telephone? Are you timid about witnessing informally? Has public apathy in the territory lessened your zeal? What if you are pressured to compromise your faith or integrity? Rely on Jehovah. Pray for strength.​—Phil. 4:13.
3 By Personal Study: Just as we gain strength by eating physical food, so we are fortified spiritually by feeding regularly on God’s Word and on the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 4:4; 24:45) When asked what gave him strength to endure years of solitary confinement in China without a Bible, Stanley Jones said: “We can stand firm in faith. Of course, we have to study first. We have no inner strength if we don’t study.”
4 By Meeting Attendance: At a Christian meeting in the first century, Judas and Silas “encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them.” (Acts 15:32) Likewise today, what we hear at the meetings deepens our appreciation for Jehovah, builds up our faith, and stimulates us for the ministry. The meetings bring us into regular contact with “fellow workers for the kingdom of God,” who are our “strengthening aid.”​—Col. 4:11.
5 We need help in these “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) Concerning those who draw strength from Jehovah, we are assured: “They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not tire out.”​—Isa. 40:31.

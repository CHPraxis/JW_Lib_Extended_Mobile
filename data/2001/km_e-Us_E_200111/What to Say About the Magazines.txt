What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Nov. 15
“We have heard the expression ‘Jesus died for us.’ [Quote John 3:16.] Have you ever wondered how the death of one man can save all of us? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives a simple answer. This article, ‘Jesus Saves​—How?,’ clearly explains it.”
Awake! Nov. 22
“Are humans doing all they can to protect the environment? [Allow for response.] Many wonder if the delicate balance of life on earth will last indefinitely. Thankfully, God is keenly interested. [Read Nehemiah 9:6.] Awake! discusses what the future holds for life on earth.”
The Watchtower Dec. 1
“This time of year, many people are very involved in gift-giving and other kind deeds. That brings to mind the Golden Rule. [Read Matthew 7:12.] Do you think it is possible to live by that rule all year round? [Allow for response.] This magazine provides much food for thought on ‘The Golden Rule​—Is It Still Practical?’”
Awake! Dec. 8
“The Bible promises that one day no one will be able to say, ‘I am sick.’ [Read Isaiah 33:24.] In line with that promise, this issue of Awake! focuses on an illness that afflicts millions of people, young and old. It is entitled ‘Hope for Arthritis Sufferers.’ I’m sure you’ll find these articles to be informative.”

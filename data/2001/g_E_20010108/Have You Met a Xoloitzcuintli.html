<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>WRITER IN MEXICO</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE first time I touched a <em>Xoloitzcuintli</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span><em>—Xolo </em>for short—I was amazed. Its black, hairless body felt so soft and hot! This champion show dog paraded majestically behind its owner, giving us a chance to admire its slim figure graced by a white “paintbrush” tip on the tail—such a contrast to its smooth black body!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Before the arrival of the Spaniards, dogs were highly valued as pets in Mesoamerica. Some were buried with their owners, as ‘companions in the afterlife.’ <em>Xolos </em>enjoyed a special place in society. It was believed that they had medicinal value. Yes, physical contact with this hot little companion seemed to help those who suffered from rheumatism. Of course, a <em>Xolo </em>could also keep your feet warm on a cold night!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Today, many find the <em>Xolo </em>to be the perfect pet. Like many other breeds, the <em>Xolo </em>can be trained and comes in different sizes—including a toy variety. Best of all, no hair means no fleas, and the <em>Xolo </em>is an ideal choice for those who are allergic to dog hair. Caring for a <em>Xolo </em>is quite easy. To keep the dog’s skin soft, it is necessary to rub it once in a while with some skin cream or oil. Miguel Ángel Moreno, a breeder, points out another advantage of the <em>Xolo: </em>“It takes only one minute to give it a bath,” he says, “and it will be dry in two.” What about the <em>Xolo’s </em>medicinal value? Even today, some say that they have found relief from rheumatic pain by holding a <em>Xolo </em>against the affected part of the body. Moreno, however, believes that the <em>Xolo </em>is only as effective “as a hot water bottle.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Not long ago the <em>Xolo </em>was considered to be an endangered species, but much effort has been made to preserve this animal. Today, <em>Xolos </em>can be found not only in Mexico but also in other countries, such as Peru and the United States. So would you like to meet a <em>Xoloitzcuintli? </em>If you ever do, you will not forget your encounter with this unique dog.</p>

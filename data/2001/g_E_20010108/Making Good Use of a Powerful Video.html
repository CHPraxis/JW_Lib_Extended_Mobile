<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN she was just 12 years old, Tillie took advantage of an opportunity to give a witness at school. The class was studying World War II, and the subject of the Holocaust arose. Tillie told her teacher that not only Jews but also Jehovah’s Witnesses were tortured and killed during this horrendous period. The teacher agreed to let Tillie bring the video <em>Purple Triangles </em>to class. Before showing the video, the teacher said to the class: “Because of the great number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust, many others who were persecuted have been overlooked. Jehovah’s Witnesses are among such groups.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The teacher was so impressed by the video that she lent it to another teacher to use in her class. Tillie remembered that her fourth grade teacher’s brother had been killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. She took the video to that teacher too, and he viewed it that very evening.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In all, more than 60 people got to see <em>Purple Triangles, </em>and much interest was aroused. All of this took place because a young girl had the courage to speak up about her religion.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:8:2-19:8:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 8:2</a>.</p>

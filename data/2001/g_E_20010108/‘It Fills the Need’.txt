“This book teaches one to get acquainted with the Creator through creation and the Bible. Up to chapter 5, it considers various facts about things created and shows that there is law and order evident among them, suggesting the need for an intelligence behind them.
“I have wanted some material that explains in more detail the wonders of creation. This book fills the need. . . . When reading about the cooperation between proteins and nucleic acid molecules in the cells, I felt that the precision is nothing short of a miracle.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Consider this paradox: In one industrialized country, more than 90 percent of the people feel that they are either very happy or fairly happy. But 3 of the 10 drugs most widely used in that land are prescribed for depression. In that same country, 91 percent of the people consider their family life to be satisfying. Yet, nearly half of the marriages there end up in divorce!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In fact, a survey of people in 18 countries, representing approximately half the world’s population, suggests that a “blanket of pessimism about the future seems to cover much of the world.” It is evident, therefore, that many are not leading a fully satisfying life. What about you? This brochure has been prepared to help you make your life truly satisfying.</p>

“Engenders Confidence and Strengthens Faith”
AN INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDY PROGRAM sponsored by Jehovah’s Witnesses recently included a several-month-long study of ancient history and prophecy as recorded in the Bible book of Daniel. Note the appreciation expressed in the following letter from Poland.
“For a long time, we desired to acquire accurate understanding of the Bible prophecy of Daniel. Now, that desire has been satisfied. The Bible study aid used, Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy!, is characterized by simple argumentation, clarity of language, and striking illustrations. All of these speak to the mind and the heart. This has added to our confidence that God’s purpose will be fulfilled in his due time. This excellent study aid engenders confidence and strengthens faith.”

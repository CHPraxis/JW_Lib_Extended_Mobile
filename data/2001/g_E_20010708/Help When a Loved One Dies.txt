Help When a Loved One Dies
Some years ago Jehovah’s Witnesses published a brochure that considered the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. Recently, a letter was received from an appreciative reader in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who wrote: “From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank you for the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. It indeed covers every detail about the loss of a loved one.”
The writer explained: “When I lost my brother in a traffic accident, the brochure gave me ‘emergency help.’ The section ‘Some Practical Suggestions,’ on page 18, was of real comfort to me. However, after four months I began to feel a very deep pain along with nostalgia. I was afraid that my emotional health was in danger.
“Again, I read this brochure, and on page 9 in the box ‘The Grieving Process,’ I noted that the period of stabilization is accompanied by sorrow along with nostalgia. I was truly comforted. Thank you for your tender mercy, which you manifest through this brochure.”

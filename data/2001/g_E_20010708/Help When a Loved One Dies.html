<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some years ago Jehovah’s Witnesses published a brochure that considered the challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one. Recently, a letter was received from an appreciative reader in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who wrote: “From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank you for the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>It indeed covers every detail about the loss of a loved one.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The writer explained: “When I lost my brother in a traffic accident, the brochure gave me ‘emergency help.’ The section ‘Some Practical Suggestions,’ on page 18, was of real comfort to me. However, after four months I began to feel a very deep pain along with nostalgia. I was afraid that my emotional health was in danger.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Again, I read this brochure, and on page 9 in the box ‘The Grieving Process,’ I noted that the period of stabilization is accompanied by sorrow along with nostalgia. I was truly comforted. Thank you for your tender mercy, which you manifest through this brochure.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the country of Thailand, a young man said that he had prayed, asking: “If you really exist, God, help me to learn your ways.” Later, the man explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at my home, but I was not there. He left a tract and an invitation with a map showing the location of the meeting place.” The man followed the directions provided. He said: “The hall was so clean and unpretentious, and the people were very warm and friendly.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Another point that struck me was that everyone had his or her own copy of the Bible and opened it to follow along with the speaker. This is exactly how I felt one should study the Bible to get to the heart of true religious teachings. A further wonder to me was the way young ones could follow along in the study and give answers too. I had never seen this before.”</p>

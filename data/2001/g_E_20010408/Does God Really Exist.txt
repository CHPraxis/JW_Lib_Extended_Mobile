Does God Really Exist?
In the country of Thailand, a young man said that he had prayed, asking: “If you really exist, God, help me to learn your ways.” Later, the man explained:
“One of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at my home, but I was not there. He left a tract and an invitation with a map showing the location of the meeting place.” The man followed the directions provided. He said: “The hall was so clean and unpretentious, and the people were very warm and friendly.
“Another point that struck me was that everyone had his or her own copy of the Bible and opened it to follow along with the speaker. This is exactly how I felt one should study the Bible to get to the heart of true religious teachings. A further wonder to me was the way young ones could follow along in the study and give answers too. I had never seen this before.”
One of the Bible-based publications used at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?

Where Are Answers to Be Found?
That is what many today ask. A schoolteacher in Novosibirsk, Russia, noted that it is not easy to find answers to the questions that her students ask about God and religion. She explained in a letter:
“When I came home one day, I discovered a little tract left there entitled ‘Why You Can Trust the Bible.’ I teach history in school, and I often have to discuss with the students such subjects as the church, the Bible, and God. Sometimes it is very difficult to find answers to the children’s questions.
“In the past, I thought that people approach God only when they have problems. But now I am sure that this is not entirely true. A person also asks: ‘Why me? Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going when I die?’ It is important to find answers to these questions. It seems that the Bible gives convincing arguments.”
The teacher concluded: “I wrote this letter because I want to know more about the Bible and God.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses direct people to the Bible for answers to their questions. Consider the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Included in its 19 chapters are those entitled: “Who Is the True God?,” “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and “Why Does God Permit Suffering?” You can request a copy of this 192-page Bible study aid by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

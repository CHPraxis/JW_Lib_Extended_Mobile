<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">The corn harvest will be good. It is therefore with a smile of satisfaction that the farmer walks through his fields, examining the ears of corn. He picks one at random, and immediately a black spot attracts his attention. A closer look shows that the ear of corn has some extremely enlarged and distorted soft kernels with a blackish color. When opened, the dark black substance gives off a mushroomlike smell. A parasitic fungus has invaded that ear of corn! Is the crop ruined? No. The farmer smiles, delighted. He contemplates the possibility of harvesting more of it!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">THE smoky, sweet flavor of the maize mushroom called <em>huitlacoche, </em>or corn smut, has been enjoyed in Mexico since ancient times. In other countries it is viewed as a delicacy, being called by some the Mexican truffle.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Ustilago maydis </em>is the fungus responsible for the formation of <em>huitlacoche. </em>The fungus invades, to a greater or lesser degree, almost every crop of the <em>Zea mays </em>corn, especially in warm, moderately dry areas. Researchers have found in <em>huitlacoche </em>extracts “three of the four amino acids related with the umami taste.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em>) <em>Huitlacoche’s </em>carbohydrate content, higher than that of other edible mushrooms, accounts for the touch of sweetness in its flavor. A large number of aromatic compounds have also been identified in this delicacy—vanillin among them. And although flavor is <em>huitlacoche’s </em>most appealing quality, its nutritional value also deserves to be taken into account, since it contains vitamin C, phosphorus, calcium, and other nutrients.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is not surprising, then, that <em>huitlacoche </em>was appreciated by the Aztecs, who gave it the name <em>cuitlacochin, </em>meaning “sleeping excrescence [abnormal growth].” Later, its name was changed to the present one. In Mexico <em>huitlacoche </em>is traditionally enjoyed in a quesadilla, that is, in a folded, handmade tortilla. Nevertheless, it is also often used in more elaborate dishes, such as crepes, soups, and sauces. Recently, this mushroom has even entered the genetic researcher’s laboratory, where ways are being studied to make crops render more of it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">If <em>huitlacoche </em>is available locally, why not try the accompanying recipe.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> You’ll wonder how a “plague” can taste so good!</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><em>Umami </em>is a word used in Japan to describe what some consider to be the fifth taste, after the four main tastes—sweet, salty, sour, and bitter.</p></div>
<div id="fn2" class="fcc"><p id="p10" data-pid="10">Canned <em>huitlacoche </em>can sometimes be purchased. In this case, it will probably be processed and ready to use. If refrigerated, <em>huitlacoche </em>can stay fresh for from 8 to 15 days.</p></div>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>Preparing <em>Huitlacoche</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sc"> 18 ounces <strong>[500 g] </strong>(or two 8-ounce <strong>[200 g] </strong>cans) fresh finely chopped <em>huitlacoche</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc"> 1 finely chopped medium-size onion (about one cup <strong>[200 g]</strong>)</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sc"> 2-4 finely chopped garlic cloves</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sc"> 2 tablespoons <strong>[30 ml] </strong>of <em>epazote </em>(<em>chenopodium ambrosioides</em>) or cilantro leaves</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc"> 3 tablespoons <strong>[45 ml] </strong>oil</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sc"> 1 tablespoon <strong>[15 ml] </strong>butter</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc"> Salt to taste</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se">  Fry the onion and garlic in the oil until they turn transparent. Add the <em>epazote </em>and the <em>huitlacoche. </em>Add the butter and the salt. Stir well. Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring often.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc">  Use this mixture, either by itself or with meat and cheese, to fill tortillas or crepes, or add it to stock to make a soup. You can also put it in a blender and make it into a puree to accompany meats.</p>

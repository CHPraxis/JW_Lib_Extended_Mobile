<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what many today ask. A schoolteacher in Novosibirsk, Russia, noted that it is not easy to find answers to the questions that her students ask about God and religion. She explained in a letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I came home one day, I discovered a little tract left there entitled ‘Why You Can Trust the Bible.’ I teach history in school, and I often have to discuss with the students such subjects as the church, the Bible, and God. Sometimes it is very difficult to find answers to the children’s questions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“In the past, I thought that people approach God only when they have problems. But now I am sure that this is not entirely true. A person also asks: ‘Why me? Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going when I die?’ It is important to find answers to these questions. It seems that the Bible gives convincing arguments.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The teacher concluded: “I wrote this letter because I want to know more about the Bible and God.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses direct people to the Bible for answers to their questions. Consider the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>Included in its 19 chapters are those entitled: “Who Is the True God?,” “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and “Why Does God Permit Suffering?” You can request a copy of this 192-page Bible study aid by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

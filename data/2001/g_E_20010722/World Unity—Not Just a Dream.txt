World Unity—Not Just a Dream
A man in the state of Kerala, India, wrote the publisher of this journal: “Your Awake! magazine certainly stands out from all other magazines. I feel there is practically no subject that it has not touched. I have especially enjoyed reading articles on nature.”
The man found Awake! appealing for a particular reason, explaining: “I don’t think there is another magazine that would equal Awake! in helping people of different nationalities to view themselves as brothers. No other magazine promotes the idea of world unity as Awake! does. When I compare the many magazines that I read, I can certainly say that Awake! is a valuable magazine.”
The reader’s observations about Awake! are in keeping with its stated purpose appearing on page 4 of every issue, namely: “It always stays politically neutral and does not exalt one race above another.” Most important, Awake! directs readers to look to our Creator for answers to the essential questions of life.
The 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? also does this. Among its 16 lessons are those entitled “Who Is God?,” “What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?,” and “What Is the Kingdom of God?” You may request a copy of this brochure by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

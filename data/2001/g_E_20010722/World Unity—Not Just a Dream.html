<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man in the state of Kerala, India, wrote the publisher of this journal: “Your <em>Awake! </em>magazine certainly stands out from all other magazines. I feel there is practically no subject that it has not touched. I have especially enjoyed reading articles on nature.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The man found <em>Awake! </em>appealing for a particular reason, explaining: “I don’t think there is another magazine that would equal <em>Awake! </em>in helping people of different nationalities to view themselves as brothers. No other magazine promotes the idea of world unity as <em>Awake! </em>does. When I compare the many magazines that I read, I can certainly say that <em>Awake! </em>is a valuable magazine.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The reader’s observations about <em>Awake! </em>are in keeping with its stated purpose appearing on page 4 of every issue, namely: “It always stays politically neutral and does not exalt one race above another.” Most important, <em>Awake! </em>directs readers to look to our Creator for answers to the essential questions of life.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The 32-page brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>also does this. Among its 16 lessons are those entitled “Who Is God?,” “What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?,” and “What Is the Kingdom of God?” You may request a copy of this brochure by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

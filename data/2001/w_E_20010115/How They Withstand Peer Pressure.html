<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE desire to be accepted influences many to conform to the thinking and actions of their peers. Especially do young people need strength to say no to harmful practices, such as drug abuse and sexual immorality. How can they withstand peer pressure?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Two teenage girls in Poland recently wrote: “The world’s spirit is clearly visible among many of our peers. They cheat on their lessons, use filthy language, and are fond of faddish dress and wild, immoral music. How happy we are to have articles that address us young ones and protect us from the influence of discontented and rebellious teenagers!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Words cannot express our gratitude for <em>Watchtower </em>articles that have impressed on us that as young people we are needed and appreciated. The Bible counsel we have received has helped us to direct our steps properly so as to continue pleasing Jehovah God. We are convinced that faithful service to Jehovah is the best way of life.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yes, young people can stand up to peer pressure. By training their “perceptive powers,” Christian youths learn to make wise decisions that do not reflect “the spirit of the world” but, rather, “the spirit which is from God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 2:12</a>.</p>

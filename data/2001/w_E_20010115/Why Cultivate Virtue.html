<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MIDDLE-AGED Japanese man named Kunihito recently migrated to the United States.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Within weeks after his arrival, he came face-to-face with a situation that could have damaged his career. Kunihito relates: “When my superior asked me if I could take on a certain responsibility, I felt quite confident about accepting it. Yet, having been brought up to view modesty as a virtue, I replied: ‘I am not sure if I can do it, but I will try my best.’ To my American supervisor, this sounded as if I was incompetent and lacked confidence. When I learned that, I realized I needed to make some adjustments.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Maria, who lives in New York City, was an excellent student, always glad to help her classmates. Juan was a fellow student who occasionally enlisted Maria’s help. But he also took a romantic interest in her and tried to impress her. Despite her desire to remain morally chaste, Maria succumbed to Juan’s advances and became involved in sexual misconduct.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Displaying virtue in today’s culturally divergent and morally corrupt world is indeed a challenge. So why cultivate virtue? Because virtuous conduct pleases God, and most of us surely desire to have his favor.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s Word, the Bible, exhorts its readers to cultivate virtue. For example, the apostle Paul writes: “Whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8</a>) And the apostle Peter urges us to put forth ‘earnest effort in supplying to our faith virtue.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:5-61:1:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:5</a>) But what is virtue? Can it be taught in a classroom? How may we cultivate it?</p>

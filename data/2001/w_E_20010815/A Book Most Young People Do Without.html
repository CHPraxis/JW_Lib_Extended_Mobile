<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“HOW should I know whether the Bible is really the Word of God? As a book, it does not interest me,” remarked a young woman named Beate.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Germany, where Beate lives, most young people share her feelings; hence, they attach little importance to reading the Bible. A recent survey there revealed that, roughly, 1 percent of young people read the Bible very often, 2 percent often, 19 percent rarely, and close to 80 percent never at all. The figures would likely be similar in other lands, perhaps also where you live. Clearly, the Bible is a book most young people do without.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No wonder, then, that Bible illiteracy is widespread among the younger generation! Early in the year 2000, the newspaper <em>Lausitzer Rundschau </em>reported on a survey that revealed how many people were familiar with the Ten Commandments and used them as a guideline in life. Of the over-60’s generation, 67 percent knew the commandments and were guided by them; for the under 30’s, the figure was just 28 percent. Yes, to many young people, the Word of God is unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Some Hold a Different View</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">On the other hand, all over the world, there are millions of young people who have found the Word of God to be extremely valuable. Alexander, for instance, is 19 years of age and reads the Bible every morning before going to work. “I could not imagine a better start to the day,” he notes. Sandra makes a point of reading a portion of the Bible every evening. “It has become part of my daily routine,” she explains. And Julia, who is 13 years old, has already developed a pattern of reading at least one chapter of the Bible before going to bed at night. “I really enjoy it, and I want to carry on that practice in the future.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Which view is correct and wise? Is the Bible really worth reading? Is it valuable and important for the younger generation? What do you think?</p>

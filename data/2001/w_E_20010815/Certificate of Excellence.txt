Certificate of Excellence
THAT is what the Association of Congolese and African Journalists for the Development (AJOCAD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo gives to “reward individuals or social organizations that distinguish themselves through their contribution toward the development in [the Congo].”
On November 17, 2000, the Certificate of Excellence was presented to Jehovah’s Witnesses for “their contribution to the development of the Congolese individual [through] the education and the teaching contained in their publications.”
In commenting on the award, the Kinshasa newspaper Le Phare said: “It is difficult to find a Congolese in whose hands the Watchtower and Awake! magazines or other publications published by Jehovah’s Witnesses have not passed. These magazines [discuss] all aspects of life.” The article also brought out that the publications show “how to cope with today’s problems” and point to “the real meaning behind current events.” Each issue of Awake! “stays politically neutral and does not exalt one race above another.” Additionally, the publications build “confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”
As noted by AJOCAD, the publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses have proved beneficial to a large portion of the Congolese population. Available in hundreds of languages, their hope-inspiring message can be beneficial to you as well.

Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• Why should the questions raised in Job chapter 38 merit consideration even today?
Many of the wonderful works to which God directed attention cannot be fully understood even by modern scientists. These include how gravity keeps the earth in orbit, what exactly light is, why the endless variety of snowflakes, how raindrops form, and how energy is involved in thunderstorms.​—4/15, pages 4-11.
• What Bible examples can help us cope with negative feelings?
Asaph, Baruch, and Naomi faced periods of discouragement or other negative feelings, and the Scriptural record of their coping successfully with such situations can help us.​—4/15, pages 22-4.
• What are some practical ways to help Christian widows?
Friends can kindly and clearly offer to help. Family members or others may be in a position to offer financial or material help, where there is genuine need. Fellow Christians can also help by offering the loving hand of friendship, providing spiritual support and comfort.​—5/1, pages 5-7.
• Why is it important to marry “only in the Lord,” as 1 Corinthians 7:39 advises?
Marriages to unbelievers have often proved disastrous. Moreover, following this divine advice is a matter of loyalty to Jehovah God. When we comply with God’s Word, our hearts do not condemn us. (1 John 3:21, 22)​—5/15, pages 20-1.
• Since Jehovah is the one who can forgive our sins, why do Christians confess serious sins to the older men in the congregation?
Yes, it is Jehovah’s forgiveness of serious sins that a Christian needs to seek. (2 Samuel 12:13) But just as the prophet Nathan provided help for David, mature older men in the congregation can help remorseful sinners. Going to the elders is in line with the direction given at James 5:14, 15.​—6/1, page 31.
• What evidence is there that we should care for orphans and widows who are in need?
The historical record shows that providing such care marked true worship among both the ancient Hebrews and the early Christians. (Exodus 22:22, 23; Galatians 2:9, 10; James 1:27) The apostle Paul included in the Scriptures clear instructions for Christians to provide care for needy widows. (1 Timothy 5:3-16)​—6/15, pages 9-11.
• What is the key to a happy, meaningful life?
We must cultivate and maintain a proper relationship with Jehovah, our heavenly Father. Studying the Bible is an important aid in our doing just that.​—7/1, pages 4-5.
• Does each human have an immortal spirit that survives death?
Though some people believe that a spirit​—not a soul—​is immortal, the Bible does not support this idea. It shows that when a human dies, he returns to the dust and is nonexistent. But God retains the ability to restore him to life, so any hope for future life, through a resurrection, rests with God. (Ecclesiastes 12:7)​—7/15, pages 3-6.
• Where was Daniel when the three Hebrews were tested on the plain of Dura?
The Bible does not say. It may be that Daniel was not obliged to be there because of his rank, or he may have been away on an official assignment. But we can be confident that he did not compromise his faithfulness to Jehovah.​—8/1, page 31.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The June 1996 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>published a Question Box that answered the question: “How should the listing for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear in a local telephone directory?” The following direction was given: “In cities having more than one congregation, we recommend the following: Jehovah’s Witnesses, (City), (State), followed by an alphabetic listing giving the name, Kingdom Hall address, and phone number of the congregations.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Reports show that a number of congregations have not listed their Kingdom Hall or they have done so incorrectly. This has caused some problems, especially in larger cities where there are several congregations. We are requesting that city overseers take the initiative to review all listings published locally. If listings are incorrect or missing entirely, the city overseer should contact the publishers of the telephone directory to make any additions or corrections needed, carefully following the guidelines provided in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>

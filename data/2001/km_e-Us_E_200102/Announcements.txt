Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!, or any older 192-page book that the congregation has in stock. March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Offer the Knowledge book or Require brochure, with a view to starting home Bible studies.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s annual S-201 letters. See also paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes, or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter.
▪ On Saturday, May 12, 2001, the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.
▪ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories may be worked by special pioneers or are accessible to nearby congregations.

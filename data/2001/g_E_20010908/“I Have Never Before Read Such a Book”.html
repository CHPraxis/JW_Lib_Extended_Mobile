<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Young Łukasz, who lives near Szczecinek in northern Poland, was fascinated with the book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>So he decided to take it to school and give it to his physics teacher. He drew her attention to information regarding the universe. He showed her the illustration on page 78 (reproduced here). It highlights alternatives concerning the origin of the universe, which you too can contemplate.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later the teacher told Łukasz: “I have never before read such a book. It explains complex scientific information so briefly and in such a simple and logical way! If I had received the book earlier, I would not have bought the newest manual on physics for the high school. I will certainly use it in my classes.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As a result of reading <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>many have been moved to think more deeply about the origin and the purpose of life as well as about how we got here. And, more important, many have been helped to reach informed conclusions.</p>

Parents—Fill Your Children’s Need!
CHILDREN need guidance and loving discipline, especially from their parents. In this regard, a Brazilian educator, Tania Zagury, says: “The tendency of every child is to seek pleasure. It is necessary to establish limits. It is the parents who have to do this. If they do not, the children get out of control.”
However, in many lands the influence of a permissive society that exalts personal freedom can make it difficult to follow the above advice. Where, then, can parents turn for help? God-fearing parents recognize that their children are “an inheritance from Jehovah.” (Psalm 127:3) Thus, they look to God’s Word, the Bible, for guidance in rearing them. For example, Proverbs 13:24 says: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.”
The Bible’s use of the word “rod” need not be understood to mean only physical punishment; it represents the means of correction, whatever form it may take. Indeed, very often words may be all that is necessary to correct a child’s wayward course. Proverbs 29:17 says: “Chastise your son and he will bring you rest and give much pleasure to your soul.”
Children need loving discipline to eliminate undesirable traits. Such firm and kind correction gives evidence that a parent cares for the child. (Proverbs 22:6) So parents, take heart! By following the sound, practical counsel of the Bible, you will please Jehovah God and gain your children’s respect.

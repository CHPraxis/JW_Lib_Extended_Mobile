<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">• <strong>Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court contributed to what legal victory involving religion?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">That court overturned another court’s negative ruling regarding Jehovah’s Witnesses and their being recognized as a corporation of public law. The victorious ruling noted that within the scope of religious freedom someone might ‘obey the tenets of faith’ more than the demands of the State.<wbr />—8/15, page 8.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">• <strong>For how long a period of time did Job suffer?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">The book of Job does not indicate that he suffered for many years. Job’s suffering and its resolution may have occurred within a few months, perhaps less than a year.<wbr />—8/15, page 31.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">• <strong>Why can we be sure that the Devil is more than a superstition?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">Jesus Christ knew that the Devil was real. Jesus was tempted by a real person, not some evil inside himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:1-40:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> John 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 14:30</a>)<wbr />—9/1, pages 5-6.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">• <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:10:15-20:10:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 10:15</strong></a> <strong>says: “The valuable things of a rich man are his strong town. The ruin of the lowly ones is their poverty.” How does this prove true?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">Riches can serve as a protection against some uncertainties in life, just as a fortified town provides a degree of security for those who reside in it. On the other hand, poverty can be ruinous when there are unexpected developments.<wbr />—9/15, page 24.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">• <strong>In what sense was a start “made of calling on the name of Jehovah” in the days of Enosh? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:26-1:4:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 4:26</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">God’s name had been used since the start of human history; hence, what began in Enosh’s time was not a calling on Jehovah in faith. Men may have applied God’s name profanely to themselves or to others through whom they pretended to worship God.<wbr />—9/15, page 29.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">• <strong>As used in the Bible, what does the word “discipline” mean?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">The word does not imply any kind of abuse or cruelty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:4:13-20:4:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 22:15</a>) The Greek word for “discipline” primarily relates to instruction, education, correction and, at times, firm but loving chastisement. An important way in which parents can imitate Jehovah is by striving to keep open the lines of communication with their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:7-58:12:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:7-10</a>)<wbr />—10/1, pages 8, 10.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">• <strong>How do true Christians today show that they are for rule by God?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">In advocating God’s Kingdom, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not mix in politics or foment rebellion, even in lands where the Witnesses are banned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Titus 3:1</a>) They make a positive contribution in the way that Jesus and his early disciples did and strive to help people adopt wholesome Biblical values, such as honesty, moral cleanness, and a good work ethic.<wbr />—10/15, page 6.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">• <strong>How are life-giving waters flowing in the Andes?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Jehovah’s Witnesses there are making the effort to bring the Bible’s truths to the people, even in the two local languages, Quechua and Aymara. The Witnesses visit people who live on islands on Lake Titicaca, including “floating” island platforms made of reeds growing in the lake waters.<wbr />—10/15, pages 8-10.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">• <strong>What has God provided for our guidance that might be likened to the computer guidance system on modern passenger airplanes?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">God has equipped humans with a capacity for moral guidance, an inner moral sense. This is our inherited conscience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:14-45:2:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 2:14, 15</a>)<wbr />—11/1, pages 3-4.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">• <strong>Why does Jesus’ death have great value?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">When the perfect man Adam sinned, he lost human life for himself and his descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) As a perfect man, Jesus sacrificed his human life, thus providing the ransom that makes it possible for faithful humans to gain everlasting life.<wbr />—11/15, pages 5-6.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn">• <strong>Who were the Scythians mentioned at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 3:11</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">The Scythians were a nomadic nation on the steppes of Eurasia, holding sway from about 700 to 300 B.C.E. They were formidable horsemen and warriors. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Colossians 3:11</a> may have implied, not a specific nation, but the worst of uncivilized people.<wbr />—11/15, pages 24-5.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn">• <strong>Why can we say that the Golden Rule is a teaching that merits our regular attention?</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">This ethical maxim is expounded in Judaism, Buddhism, Greek philosophy, and Confucianism. However, what Jesus directed in the Sermon on the Mount requires positive actions, and it touches the life of people everywhere and in every age. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>)<wbr />—12/1, page 3.</p>

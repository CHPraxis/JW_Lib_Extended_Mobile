▪ Since the Gilead graduation will be held on Saturday, March 9, 2002, no tours will be conducted that day at the branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York. Any who have planned to visit on that Saturday should reschedule their visit to another convenient time. No congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup that day.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 2001 with their December literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ Memorial invitations for 2002 in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent to your congregation. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested immediately on a Literature Request Form (S-14). Memorial invitations are available in Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Chinese (Simplified), Croatian, Dutch, East Armenian, English, French, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Iloko, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Macedonian, Marshallese, Papiamento, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Serbian, Spanish, Tagalog, Turkish, and Vietnamese. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.
▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2003 will be on Wednesday, April 16, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk, he should be selected.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Who would likely watch the video <em>To the Ends of the Earth </em>over and over again? Those who have the goal of becoming missionaries. Why? To familiarize themselves with the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The video marked the 50th anniversary of this unique school, which was created to expand the witness work to “all the ends of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:27-19:22:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 22:27</a>) Watching it will increase your appreciation for the all-important work of preaching the good news and will stir you to increased activity. Consider: <strong>(1) </strong>By the early 1940’s, what had become a major concern of Jehovah’s organization? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) <strong>(2) </strong>In 1942, what startling Bible prophecy was in course of fulfillment, and how was our focus different from that of the world in general? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:8-66:17:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 17:8</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="55" href="jwpub://p/E:1989282/16-16"><em>w</em>89 4/15 p. 14 par. 12</a>) <strong>(3) </strong>What plans were made to take advantage of the anticipated period of peace after World War II? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="56" href="jwpub://p/E:1101993032/7-10"><em>jv </em>p. 522 pars. 1-2</a>) <strong>(4) </strong>What qualities of the students of the first class of Gilead School do you admire? <strong>(5) </strong>In Gilead’s first 50 years, how many students graduated, and to how many lands were they sent? <strong>(6) </strong>How much education in the Bible do the students actually get? <strong>(7) </strong>What makes a good missionary and teacher of God’s Word? <strong>(8) </strong>What is life as a missionary like, and what challenges have to be faced? <strong>(9) </strong>How do missionaries feel about their way of life, and what special joys result from their self-sacrificing course? <strong>(10) </strong>What have the thousands of missionaries accomplished thus far? Give examples. <strong>(11) </strong>What impressions do you have of the brothers and sisters who have gone to “the ends of the earth” to preach? <strong>(12) </strong>What does the example set by missionaries encourage you to do, and why?</p>

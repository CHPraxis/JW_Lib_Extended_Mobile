<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The ability to speak is taken for granted by most people. However, speech is a gift from Jehovah. It allows us to communicate with others and to express our thoughts and feelings. Foremost, with it we can praise our God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:4-46:1:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 1:4-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Men, women, and children are trained in the Theocratic Ministry School to declare Jehovah’s name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>) The school program for 2002 covers a wide range of Bible subjects that we can personally benefit from and use in the ministry. By preparing for the school and participating in it, we can increase our knowledge and our skills as teachers of God’s Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:1-19:45:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 45:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Read the Bible Daily: </strong>If we usually have a Bible close at hand, we can take advantage of any free time that we have to read it. Most of us have a few spare minutes during the day that we could use in this way. How beneficial it is to read at least one page every day, which is all that it takes to keep up with the Bible-reading program outlined in the school schedule!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The ability to read the Bible well can help us to reach the heart of our listeners and motivate them to praise Jehovah. The brothers who handle Assignment No. 2 in the school should practice, practice, practice reading the assignment aloud. The school overseer will offer commendation and suggestions to improve the reading.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Use the <em>Reasoning </em>Book: </strong>Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 are based on the <em>Reasoning </em>book. Most of us could probably be more conscious of using this practical aid in the field ministry. The sisters should choose settings that are practical for the territory. The school overseer should pay particular attention to how they teach and make use of the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>May the Theocratic Ministry School help all of us to continue using our God-given gift of speech to declare the good news and to praise our great God, Jehovah!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:1-19:34:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 34:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:19-49:6:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eph. 6:19</a>.</p>

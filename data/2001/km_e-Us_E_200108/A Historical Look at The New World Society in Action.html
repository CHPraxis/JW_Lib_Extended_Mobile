<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As you view the video presentation of this 1954 film, think of the answers to these questions: <strong>(1) </strong>Why was this film originally produced, and what did it accomplish? <strong>(2) </strong>What material do Jehovah’s Witnesses publish, for whom, and why? <strong>(3) </strong>How does today’s circulation of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine compare with that of 1954? <strong>(4) </strong>In recent years, how has our printing operation become more modernized? <strong>(5) </strong>What impresses you about the 1953 international convention that was held at Yankee Stadium? <strong>(6) </strong>What was Trailer City, and what outstanding things did you notice about it? <strong>(7) </strong>What shows that our work is not just of one nation, one nationality, or one people? <strong>(8) </strong>In what ways have you sensed the loving spirit with which Jehovah’s organization functions? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) <strong>(9) </strong>Who do you think would appreciate seeing this historical look at the activities of the new world society during the 1950’s?</p>

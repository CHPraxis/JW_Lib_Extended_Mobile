<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>If Someone Says. Discussion and demonstrations. In the ministry, when people make statements or raise questions that we do not anticipate, we should endeavor to reply instead of changing the subject or ending the conversation. The <em>Reasoning </em>book will often be helpful in this regard. Point out some common remarks, and have publishers demonstrate how to respond with the comments in the <em>Reasoning </em>book. For example: ‘I don’t believe in God.’ (pages 150-1) ‘Why don’t you get involved in efforts to improve the community?’ (pages 207-8) ‘It doesn’t matter what church you belong to.’ (page 332) Encourage all to use this feature of the <em>Reasoning </em>book when unexpected situations arise in the ministry.</p>

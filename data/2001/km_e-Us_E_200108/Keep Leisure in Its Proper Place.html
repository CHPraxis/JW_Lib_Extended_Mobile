<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In these difficult days, all of us need a change of pace from time to time. A certain amount of recreation is proper. However, too much time spent on leisure, entertainment, and socializing can lull a person into spending less and less time in spiritual pursuits. We must keep leisure in its proper place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) How is this possible? By following the advice found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Set Limits: </strong>Paul wrote that Christians ought to “keep strict watch” as to how wisely they live their lives. Moderation and self-control are needed to limit leisure time to what is really necessary. It is good to give serious thought to the way in which we use our free time. Recreation should serve some beneficial purpose rather than make us feel that we have wasted our time or leave us exhausted. If we are left feeling empty, unrewarded, and somewhat guilty after engaging in an activity, this would indicate that adjustments need to be made in our use of time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Be Reasonable: </strong>Paul gave counsel on “buying out the opportune time” for the more important things of life, not becoming “unreasonable.” Dedicated Christians cannot allow their lives to be centered on leisure. Although rest and diversion can renew us physically, the source of spiritual energy is God’s active force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 40:29-31</a>) We receive his spirit in connection with theocratic activities​—studying the Bible, attending congregation meetings, engaging in field service—​not through recreation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Establish Priorities: </strong>Paul instructed Christians to “go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” Jesus taught that our activities should center on God’s Kingdom as our priority in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) It is imperative that we <em>first </em>do the things that will allow us to live up to our dedication to Jehovah. Afterward, leisure time can be kept in its proper place. When that is done, it will have a wholesome effect, and we will enjoy it more.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:12-21:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT was how a man in Tokyo felt when he read the life story in the December 1, 2000, issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>The article was entitled “You Do Not Know What Your Life Will Be Tomorrow,” and it related the experience of a former missionary who suffers from the malady known medically as manic-depressive psychosis.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The man from Tokyo said in a letter addressed to the publishers of this magazine: “The symptoms described fit me perfectly. So I went to a psychiatric hospital and learned that I have manic depression. The doctor who examined me was amazed. He said, ‘People with this sickness rarely think that they are ill.’ I was helped to determine the sickness before it got too serious.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>When would it be appropriate to form an additional Congregation Book Study group?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Forming a new group should be considered when it is necessary in order to maintain an attendance of about 15 or fewer at each of the book study locations, including the Kingdom Hall. Why is this recommended?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Congregation Book Study groups are kept small, the conductor is better able to give attention to each one who attends. Additionally, all have ample opportunity to comment in a setting that is conducive to making public declaration of their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13:15</a>) Having smaller groups in several locations throughout the congregation’s territory makes attending the Congregation Book Study and meetings for field service more convenient. Congregations that have increased the number of locations have found that the combined attendance at the book study has also increased.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There may be special circumstances that make it advisable to form another group, even if it will be rather small. This may be true in an isolated area or where present locations are crowded or lack adequate seating. When needed, a group can be formed that meets during the day for the benefit of older ones, night workers, or sisters with non-Witness husbands.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Each book study group should have several spiritually strong and active publishers assigned as well as a qualified conductor and reader. Brothers should reach out to fill these needs in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Elders can promote the advancement of the congregation by ensuring that the congregation’s book study groups are reasonable in size and spiritually well cared for and that they meet at convenient locations. Whenever it is practical, new groups should be formed so that all can take full advantage of the benefits of this unique spiritual arrangement. Could you offer your home as a book study location? Many who have done so have experienced spiritual blessings.</p>

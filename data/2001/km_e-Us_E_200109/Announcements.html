<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should take notice of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a> regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The April 10, 2001, letter to all congregations announced the release of the new video documentary <em>No Blood​—Medicine Meets the Challenge. </em>The program has been <em>specially prepared for the public. </em>Therefore, much good can result from our initiating conversations and then viewing the program with unbelieving mates or relatives, teachers, workmates, schoolmates, neighbors, and Bible students. Any questions or comments that follow a viewing of the program with non-Witnesses may provide a basis for making a return visit or starting a Bible study.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) Talk and audience discussion reviewing the circuit assembly program that was held during the past service year. Invite publishers to comment on key points learned and how they were able to apply them personally or as family groups. (Portions can be assigned in advance.) Feature these program parts: (1) “Love for God Motivates Us in Our Ministry.” Such love helps us cope with negative feelings that might inhibit our preaching​—timidity, feelings of inadequacy, fear of men. (2) “Lovers of Jehovah Hate What Is Bad.” (<em>w</em>99 10/1 28-31) Having a relationship with God depends on our hating what he hates​—not only what is obviously wicked but also subtle wrongs. (3) “Pursue the Surpassing Way of Love.” (<em>w</em>92 7/15 27-30) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">First Corinthians 13:4-8</a> shows why we patiently put up with the imperfections of others, avoid self-centeredness and competition, do not spread harmful gossip, and remain loyal to God’s organization. (4) “Things in the World​—How Do We View Them?” We should <em>not </em>love the things in the world, succumb to desires of the flesh, be misled by desires of the eyes, or make a showy display of our means of life. (5) “Being No Part of the World Safeguards Us.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Second Corinthians 6:14-17</a> shows how certain beliefs, customs, and practices can make us unacceptable to God. We must discern and avoid pitfalls devised by the Devil. (6) “Divine Promises to Those Loving God.” (<em>w</em>86 6/15 5-6) Jehovah’s blessing adds delight to our lives and enriches us spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:17-54:6:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:17-19</a>.</p>

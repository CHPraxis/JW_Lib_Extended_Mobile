Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Angola
Do decades of civil war stifle belief in God? Do hardships and persecution crush all willingness to share with others the truth of God’s Word? The historical record of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Angola answers with a resounding no! The story of those who serve there will also strengthen your faith in Jehovah’s sustaining power.
Argentina
Imagine the challenge of declaring the good news throughout a country that covers over a million square miles [2.7 million km2], includes varied terrain, and is populated by people of diverse ancestry. Then think about how this work was done while Jehovah’s Witnesses were under a national ban for 30 years. See how the Witnesses in this South American country have overcome such obstacles.
French Guiana
Why would people exert themselves to proclaim the good news amid dangers in a dense rain forest? What would move people to negotiate river rapids by canoe in order to reach remote villages? A desire to reach honesthearted ones with Bible truth. Many have done just that in French Guiana, South America. Read their exciting story of faith and courage.

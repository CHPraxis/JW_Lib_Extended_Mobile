2001 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 2000
“Stand Complete and With Firm Conviction in All the Will of God.”—Col. 4:12.
That scripture, our yeartext for 2001, is taken from an earnest prayer by Epaphras, a first-century disciple, in behalf of fellow Christians. We too should pray earnestly in behalf of others. And it should be our determination, with God’s help, to conduct ourselves personally as mature Christians, fully convinced of the certainty of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises as we expend ourselves whole-souled in doing God’s will.

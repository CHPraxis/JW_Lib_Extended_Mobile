<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">EXODUS 34:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">1, 2. (a) Who in the past benefited from Jehovah’s long-suffering? (b) What does the word “long-suffering” mean?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">THE people in Noah’s day, the Israelites trekking through the wilderness with Moses, the Jews alive when Jesus walked on earth<wbr />—all lived under different circumstances. But all benefited from the same kindly quality of Jehovah<wbr />—long-suffering. For some, it meant their very lives. And Jehovah’s long-suffering can mean our lives too.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What is long-suffering? When does Jehovah show it, and why? “Long-suffering” has been defined as “the patient endurance of wrong or provocation, combined with a refusal to give up hope for improvement in the disturbed relationship.” This quality, therefore, has a purpose. It looks particularly to the welfare of the one causing a disagreeable situation. Being long-suffering does not mean condoning wrong, however. When the purpose for long-suffering is accomplished or when there is no point in putting up with the situation any more, long-suffering ends.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. What has been the purpose of Jehovah’s long-suffering, and what is its limit?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>While humans can be long-suffering, Jehovah is the supreme example of this quality. In the years since sin disturbed the relationship between Jehovah and his human creation, our Creator has shown patient endurance and has provided the means whereby repentant humans can improve their relationship with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:10</a>) But when his long-suffering has achieved its purpose, God will take action against willful wrongdoers, bringing the present wicked system to an end.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Consistent With God’s Primary Attributes</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. (a) How is the idea of long-suffering expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures? (See also footnote.) (b) How does the prophet Nahum describe Jehovah, and what does this reveal about Jehovah’s long-suffering?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In the Hebrew Scriptures, the notion of long-suffering is expressed by two Hebrew words that literally mean “length of nostrils” and are rendered “slow to anger” in the <em>New World Translation.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Speaking of God’s long-suffering, the prophet Nahum said: “Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power, and by no means will Jehovah hold back from punishing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:1:3-34:1:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nahum 1:3</a>) Hence, Jehovah’s long-suffering is not a sign of weakness and is not without limits. The fact that the almighty God is at once slow to anger and great in power shows that his long-suffering is the result of purposeful restraint. He has the power to punish, but he deliberately refrains from immediately doing so in order to give the wrongdoer the opportunity to change. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:18:31-26:18:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:31, 32</a>) Jehovah’s long-suffering is, therefore, an expression of his love, and it demonstrates his wisdom in the use of his power.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. In what way is Jehovah’s long-suffering compatible with his justice?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span><sup>5 </sup>Jehovah’s long-suffering is also compatible with his justice and righteousness. He revealed himself to Moses as “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger [“longsuffering,” <em>King James Version</em>] and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6</a>) Years later, Moses sang in praise of Jehovah: “All his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) Yes, Jehovah’s mercy, long-suffering, justice, and uprightness all work together harmoniously.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6. What remarkable evidence of long-suffering has Jehovah displayed toward the descendants of Adam and Eve?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Adam and Eve’s rebellion in Eden permanently severed their precious relationship with their loving Creator, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:8-1:3:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 3:8-13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:23-1:3:24" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>) This alienation affected their offspring, who inherited sin, imperfection, and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:17-45:5:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 5:17-19</a>) Although the first human couple were willful sinners, Jehovah allowed them to produce children. Later, he lovingly provided the means whereby the descendants of Adam and Eve could be reconciled with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 36</a>) The apostle Paul explained: “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, therefore, since we have been declared righteous now by his blood, shall we be saved through him from wrath. For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:8-45:5:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 5:8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. How did Jehovah show long-suffering before the Flood, and why was the destruction of the pre-Flood generation justified?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jehovah’s long-suffering was seen in Noah’s day. Over a century before the Flood, “God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:12-1:6:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 6:12</a>) Still, for a limited time, Jehovah showed long-suffering toward mankind. He said: “My spirit shall not act toward man indefinitely in that he is also flesh. Accordingly his days shall amount to a hundred and twenty years.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:3-1:6:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 6:3</a>) Those 120 years allowed faithful Noah time to produce a family and<wbr />—when informed of God’s decree—<wbr />to build an ark and <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>warn his contemporaries of the coming Flood. The apostle Peter wrote: “The patience [a quality related to long-suffering] of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:20-60:3:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:20</a>) True, those outside Noah’s immediate household “took no note” of his preaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:38-40:24:39" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:38, 39</a>) But by having Noah construct the ark and serve perhaps for several decades as “a preacher of righteousness,” Jehovah offered Noah’s contemporaries ample opportunity to repent of their violent ways and turn to serving Him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:7</a>) The eventual destruction of that wicked generation was fully justified.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8. How was Jehovah’s long-suffering manifested toward the nation of Israel?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah’s long-suffering toward Israel lasted much longer than 120 years. Throughout the more than 1,500 years of their history as God’s chosen people, there were comparatively few periods when the Israelites did not try God’s long-suffering to the limit. Only weeks after their miraculous deliverance from Egypt, they turned to idol worship, showing gross disrespect for their Savior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:32:4-2:32:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Exodus 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:106:21-19:106:21" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Psalm 106:21</a>) During the succeeding decades, the Israelites complained about the food Jehovah miraculously supplied in the desert, murmured against Moses and Aaron, spoke against Jehovah, and committed fornication with pagans, even sharing in Baal worship.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9. How did Jehovah prove to be a God of long-suffering during the time of the Judges and during the monarchy?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>During the time of the Judges, the Israelites repeatedly fell away to idolatry. When they did so, Jehovah abandoned them to their enemies. But when they repented and called on him for help, he exercised long-suffering and raised up judges to deliver them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:2:17-7:2:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judges 2:17, 18</a>) During the long period of the monarchy, few kings showed exclusive devotion to Jehovah. And even under the faithful kings, the people often mixed true worship with false. When Jehovah raised up prophets to warn against unfaithfulness, the people usually preferred to listen to corrupt priests and false prophets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:5:31-24:5:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jeremiah 5:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:25:4-24:25:7" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 25:4-7</a>) Indeed, the Israelites persecuted Jehovah’s faithful prophets and even killed some of them.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>History shows, however, that God’s long-suffering has a limit.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Even while executing his judgments against Israel and Judah, however, Jehovah did not forget to be long-suffering. By means of his prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah foretold a restoration of his chosen people. He said: “In accord with the fulfilling of seventy years at Babylon I shall turn my attention to you people, and I will establish toward you my good word in bringing you back to this place. And I will let myself be found by you . . .

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>A remnant from among the exiled Jews did indeed return to Judah and revive the worship of Jehovah at the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. In the outworking of Jehovah’s purposes, this remnant would become like “dew from Jehovah,” which brings refreshment and prosperity. They would also be courageous and strong like “a lion among the beasts of a forest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:7-33:5:8" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Micah 5:7, 8</a>) This latter expression may have been fulfilled during the Maccabean period when the Jews under the family of the Maccabees expelled their enemies from the Promised Land and rededicated the temple, which had been defiled. Thus the land and the temple were preserved so that another faithful remnant would be able to welcome the Son of God when he appeared there as the Messiah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:25-27:9:25" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:13-42:1:17" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Luke 1:13-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:67-42:1:79" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 67-79;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:15-42:3:15" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 3:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="28-5" class="b"> 21, 22</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>From mankind’s original calamitous fall into sin up until now, Jehovah has shown himself to be a long-suffering God. His long-suffering before the Flood allowed time for due warning to be given and a means of salvation to be built. But his patience reached a limit, and the Flood came. Similarly today, Jehovah is showing great long-suffering, and this is lasting longer than some may have anticipated. However, that is no reason to give up. To do so would be tantamount to criticizing God for being long-suffering. Paul asked: “Do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, because you do not know that the kindly quality of God is trying to lead you to repentance?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:4-45:2:4" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 2:4</a>.</p>

Ours and, by extension, that of countless others who still need to hear the “good news of the kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:15-61:3:15" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14</a>) This will help us to appreciate the rich generosity of Jehovah’s long-suffering and move us to be long-suffering in our dealings with others.</p>

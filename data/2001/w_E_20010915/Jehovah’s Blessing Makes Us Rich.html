<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“The blessing of Jehovah<wbr />—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PROVERBS 10:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">1, 2. Why is happiness not associated with material wealth?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">MATERIALISTIC pursuits govern the lives of millions today. But do material things make them happy? “I can’t remember a time when people have been so gloomy about their lot,” says <em>The Australian Women’s Weekly. </em>It adds: “It’s a paradox. We’re told that Australia is in excellent shape economically, that life has never been better. . . . Still pessimism is rife across the nation. Men and women alike sense that something is missing from their lives but aren’t able to define what it is.” How true the Scriptures are in pointing out that neither happiness nor life results from the things we possess!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 12:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Bible teaches that the greatest happiness comes from God’s blessing. In this regard, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a> states: “The blessing of Jehovah<wbr />—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” Pain often results from greedy acquisition of material riches. Fittingly, the apostle Paul warned: “Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3. Why do God’s servants experience trials?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>On the other hand, painless blessings overtake all who “keep listening to the voice of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:2-5:28:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>) Yet, some may ask, ‘If no pain is added to Jehovah’s blessing, why do many of God’s servants suffer?’ The Bible reveals that our trials are permitted by God but actually originate with Satan, his wicked system, and our own imperfect nature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:5-1:6:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 32:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> James 1:14, 15</a>) Jehovah is the source of “every good gift and every perfect present.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) Hence, his blessings never cause pain.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4. What blessing and priceless gift do Jehovah’s people enjoy during this “time of the end”?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Regarding “the time of the end,” Daniel’s prophecy states: “The true knowledge will become abundant.” However, this was qualified by the words: “No wicked ones at all will understand; but the ones having insight will understand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 12:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:10-27:12:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Imagine that! God’s Word<wbr />—prophecy in particular—<wbr />is expressed with such divine wisdom that the wicked cannot get the real sense of it, though Jehovah’s people do. “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,” prayed God’s Son, “because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones, and have revealed them to babes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:21-42:10:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 10:21</a>) What a blessing it is to have the priceless gift of God’s written Word, the Bible, and to be among those to whom Jehovah has granted spiritual insight!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:21-46:1:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:27-46:1:28" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:14-46:2:15" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 5. What is wisdom, and how can we obtain it?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>We would have no spiritual insight at all were it not for “the wisdom from above.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 3:17</a>) Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge and understanding to solve problems, avoid or avert dangers, achieve goals, or provide sound counsel. How do we obtain godly wisdom? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:6-20:2:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:6</a> states: “Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment.” Yes, Jehovah will bless us with wisdom if we persist in praying for it, even as he gave King Solomon “a wise and understanding heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:3:11-11:3:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> James 1:5-8</a>) To gain wisdom, we must also keep listening to Jehovah by regularly studying and applying his Word.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 6. Why is it the course of wisdom to apply God’s laws and principles in our life?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Prime examples of godly wisdom are found in the Bible’s laws and principles. These benefit us in every way<wbr />—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. The psalmist fittingly sang: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, bringing back the soul. The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>the inexperienced one wise. The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice; the commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine. The fear of Jehovah is pure, standing forever. The judicial decisions of Jehovah are true; they have proved altogether righteous. They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much refined gold.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:7-19:19:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:72-19:119:72" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 119:72</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>On the other hand, those who disregard God’s righteous standards do not find the happiness and freedom they seek. Sooner or later, they discover that God is not one to be mocked, for a person will reap what he sows. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Millions who disregard Bible principles are reaping such tragic consequences as unwanted pregnancies, loathsome diseases, or debilitating addictions. Unless they repentantly change their course in life, their path will ultimately lead them to death and perhaps destruction at God’s hand.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>However, those who love God’s Word and apply it will be overtaken with rich blessings now and in the future. They rightly feel liberated by God’s law, are truly happy, and keenly await the time when they will be set free from sin and its deadly effects. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:20-45:8:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 8:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> James 1:25</a>) This hope is sure because it rests on God’s most loving gift to mankind<wbr />—the ransom sacrifice of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Another loving gift of God for which we should be grateful is his holy spirit. On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter urged the multitude present in Jerusalem: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:38-44:2:38" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 2:38</a>) Today, Jehovah gives holy spirit to his dedicated servants who pray for it and who want to do his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:9-42:11:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 11:9-13</a>) In ancient times, this most potent force in the universe<wbr />—God’s holy spirit, or active force—<wbr />empowered men and women of faith, including the early Christians.

Over the years, Jehovah’s rich blessing overtook Laurel. For instance, she was able to help some 17 individuals to come to an accurate knowledge of Bible truth, even though she was confined to her machine 24 hours a day! Her situation calls to mind the apostle Paul’s words: “When I am weak, then I am powerful.” <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:12:10-47:12:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>) Yes, any success we might have in preaching the good news stems, not from our own ability and power, but from God’s help by holy spirit, which he gives to those who keep on listening to his voice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) This “fruitage of the spirit” is part of “the new personality” that Christians put on in place of any rapacious, beastlike traits they may formerly have displayed.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Christian love is another blessed gift from Jehovah<wbr />—one that we rightly cherish.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 9:36</a>) These women may have had fleshly relatives, but Tabitha wanted to do what she could to help and encourage them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:18-62:3:18" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 John 3:18</a>) What a fine example Tabitha set! Brotherly love moved Prisca and Aquila to ‘risk their own necks’ for Paul.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:1:9-8:1:9" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ruth 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Ephesians 3:14, 15</a>) Children too are a precious “inheritance from Jehovah,” bringing joy to parents who successfully instill godly qualities in them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>) If you are a parent, keep listening to Jehovah’s voice by training your little ones according to his Word. Those who do so are sure to experience Jehovah’s support and rich blessing.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 22:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:1-49:6:4" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Ephesians 6:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20. What may be helpful to parents whose children turn away from true worship?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Despite the conscientious efforts of godly parents, perhaps certain ones of their children choose to turn away from true worship when they get older. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:26:34-1:26:35" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Genesis 26:34, 35</a>) This can be emotionally devastating to parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:21-20:17:21" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:25-20:17:25" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Instead of giving up all hope, however, it may be helpful for them to remember Jesus’ illustration of the prodigal son. Although that son left home and pursued a wayward course, he later returned to the house of his father, who received him in a joyful and loving manner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:15:11-42:15:32" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Luke 15:11-32</a>) Whatever may happen, faithful Christian parents can be assured of Jehovah’s understanding, his loving concern, and his unfailing support.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:14-19:145:14" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 145:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">21. To whom should we listen, and why?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Let each of us, then, determine what is truly important in our life. Are we avidly pursuing material abundance, which may bring pain to us and to our families? Or are we pursuing the ‘good gifts and perfect presents’ that come from “the Father of the celestial lights”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="54-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) Satan, “the father of the lie,” wants us to toil for material wealth and to lose out on both happiness and life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="55-1" class="b">John 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Luke 12:15</a>) Jehovah, though, has our very best interests at heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>) So, then, let us keep on listening to our loving heavenly Father and always “take exquisite delight” in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:4-19:37:4" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Psalm 37:4</a>) If we pursue such a course, Jehovah’s priceless gifts and abundant blessing will make us rich<wbr />—and that without a hint of pain.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE great majority of people in Central Africa believe in God. They have no doubt that he is the Creator of all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) Just like many people elsewhere, though, they often ignore his personal name<wbr />—Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">People in Central Africa, as well as in other parts of the world, refer to God’s name when they say, “Hallowed be thy name” in the Lord’s Prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) But for a long time, few knew that name. Over the years, however, the zealous preaching activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses has changed people’s attitude toward the use of the divine name. Today, the divine name is widely known and accepted in many African languages, such as Zulu (uJehova), Yoruba (Jehofah), Xhosa (uYehova) and Swahili (Yehova). Yet, most Bible translations in these languages still avoid using the divine name.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A fine translation that does use the divine name is the Bible in Zande, a language spoken in parts of the Central African Republic, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In that part of the world, people use God’s name, spelling it Yekova in their native tongue. Regardless of how the divine name is presented in a vernacular language, it is important to use it. Why? Because “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:13-45:10:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 10:13</a>.</p>

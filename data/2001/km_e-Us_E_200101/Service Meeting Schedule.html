<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"> <strong>7 min: </strong>Local announcements. Selected Announcements from <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:202001000/">Let Your Light Shine</a>.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Include comments on <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1997403/16-17">June 1, 1997, <em>Watchtower, </em>page 15, paragraphs 12-13</a>.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>Loving Provisions for Our Health Care. Talk by a qualified elder, based on the December 1, 2000, letter and outline from the Society. Emphasize that the best possible legal protection against unwanted transfusions is achieved by filling out <em>both </em>the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the Society’s health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) form. These documents will be made available to baptized publishers after tonight’s meeting, but they should NOT be filled out tonight. The congregation should have a sufficient quantity of <em>all three​</em>—the card, the revised DPA, and the Advance Directive Guide—​on hand for distribution. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done after the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the individual sign the document. The Society’s Advance Directive Guide should be carefully considered before completing the DPA. If a publisher has moved to another state, he should execute a new DPA form for that state. Book study conductors should ensure that all assigned to their group have the assistance they need to fill out the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the DPA form. Identity Cards for children are available to parents after this meeting. Unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive for themselves and their children by adapting language from these documents to their own circumstances and convictions.</p>

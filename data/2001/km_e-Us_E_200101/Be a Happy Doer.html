<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus said that during his presence, the vast majority would ‘take no note,’ just as in Noah’s day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37-39</a>) It is expected, then, that many individuals will not listen to the Kingdom good news. What can help us maintain a joyful spirit as we perform our ministry?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:2-19:100:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 100:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>First, we need to keep in mind that both our message and our commission to preach are from God. Any lack of response in the ministry, despite our best efforts, is really a rejection of Jehovah. Recalling that our faithfulness in preaching has his smile of approval will help us to maintain our joy and inner happiness as doers of God’s word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Second, there are still individuals who will accept Jehovah’s means of salvation. Although the majority may be apathetic, there are sheeplike ones yet to be gathered, even now, deep in the time of the end. We need to keep preaching, going “into whatever city or village” to “search out who in it is deserving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Maintain a Positive Attitude: </strong>The deplorable record of false religion has disillusioned some. Others have been “skinned and thrown about” by this system of things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:36-40:9:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 9:36</a>) Many may be overwhelmed by their lack of employment, health care, and security. Understanding this will help us to persevere in our work. Endeavor to initiate conversations that address the issues of greatest concern to the people in our territory. Help them see that God’s Kingdom is the only solution. Use the Scriptures and specific points in the publications to reach their hearts with the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Happy doers of God’s word always remember: “The joy of Jehovah is [our] stronghold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10</a>) There is no need to lose our joy. “If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:13-40:10:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 10:13</a>) Jehovah renews our joy and strength as we patiently endure in his sacred service, and he blesses our faithfulness.</p>

“Let Your Light Shine”
1 The world around us is in darkness morally and spiritually. The light of truth exposes “the unfruitful works” of darkness so that these deadly stumbling blocks can be avoided. Consequently, the apostle Paul urged Christians: “Go on walking as children of light.”​—Eph. 5:8, 11.
2 “The fruitage of the light” is in sharp contrast with the world’s gloom. (Eph. 5:9) To produce this fruitage requires that we be shining examples in Christian living, the sort of people that Jesus approves. We must also show such qualities as wholeheartedness, sincerity, and enthusiasm for the truth. This fruitage needs to be manifested in our everyday life and in our ministry.
3 Shine at Every Opportunity: Jesus told his disciples: “Let your light shine before men.” (Matt. 5:16) In imitation of Jesus, we reflect Jehovah’s light by preaching about God’s Kingdom and his purposes. We shine as illuminators when we visit the homes of people and when we spread the truth at work, at school, among our neighbors, or wherever else we have the opportunity.​—Phil. 2:15.
4 Jesus said that some would hate the light. (John 3:20) So we are not discouraged when the majority refuse to let “the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ” shine through to them. (2 Cor. 4:4) Jehovah reads the hearts of mankind and does not want practicers of unrighteousness among his people.
5 When we follow Jehovah’s ways and enjoy spiritual light, we can reflect it to others. If they recognize through our conduct that we “possess the light of life,” then they too may be motivated to make needed changes so as to become light bearers.​—John 8:12.
6 By letting our light shine, we bring praise to our Creator and help sincere ones get to know him and gain the hope of everlasting life. (1 Pet. 2:12) Since we have the light, let us use it to help others see the way out of spiritual darkness and produce the works that belong to the light.

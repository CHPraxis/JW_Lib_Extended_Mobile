<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH is a true refuge for his people. If we are wholly devoted to him, we may be ‘pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; perplexed, but not with no way out; persecuted, but not left in the lurch; thrown down, but not destroyed.’ Why? Because Jehovah grants us “power beyond what is normal.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:7-47:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7-9</a>) Yes, our heavenly Father helps us to pursue a godly life, and we can take to heart the psalmist’s words: “Because you said: ‘Jehovah is my refuge,’ you have made the Most High himself your dwelling; no calamity will befall you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:9-19:91:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 91:9, 10</a>.</p>

Possibly a single voice was heard next (91:9a) and was answered by a group (91:9b-13). Then one singer may have sung the final words (91:14-16).

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">5, 6. What “pestilence” has caused “adversities,” but why do Jehovah’s people not succumb to it?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The psalmist cites “the pestilence causing adversities.” Like a contagious epidemic disease, there is something that causes “adversities” for the human family and for upholders of Jehovah’s sovereignty. In this regard, historian Arnold Toynbee wrote: “Since the end of World War II nationalism has doubled the number of local sovereign independent states . . . Mankind’s present mood is increasingly divisive.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Through the centuries, certain rulers have fanned the flames of divisive international strife. They have also demanded that reverence be directed to them or to various images or symbols. But Jehovah has never let his faithful people succumb to such a “pestilence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:1-27:3:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Daniel 3:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:20-27:3:27" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 20-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:7-27:6:10" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 6:7-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:16-27:6:22" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 16-22</a>) As a loving international brotherhood, we give Jehovah exclusive devotion, maintain Scriptural neutrality, and impartially acknowledge that “in every nation the man that fears [God] and works righteousness is acceptable to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:20:4-2:20:6" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Exodus 20:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:8-60:5:9" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:8, 9</a>) Although we suffer “adversities” in the form of persecution as Christians, we are joyful and spiritually secure “in the secret place of the Most High.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Having Jehovah as our refuge, we draw comfort from the words: <em>“With his pinions he </em><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><em>will block approach to you, and under his wings you will take refuge. </em><em>His trueness will be a large shield and bulwark.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:4-19:91:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 91:4</a>) God protects us, even as a parent bird hovers protectively over its young. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:31:5-23:31:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:5</a>) ‘With his pinions he blocks approach to us.’ Broadly, a bird’s “pinions” are its wings. With them a bird covers its young, protecting them from predators. Like mere fledglings, we are secure under Jehovah’s figurative pinions because we have taken refuge in his true Christian organization.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:5:1-19:5:1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Psalm 5:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:5:11-19:5:11" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>We trust in “trueness,” or faithfulness. It is like a large shield of ancient times, often doorlike in shape and big enough to cover a person’s entire body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:5:12-19:5:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 5:12</a>) Confidence in such protection frees us from fear.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:16-49:6:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:16</a>) It is also a bulwark, a strong defensive mound behind which we stand firm.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In view of God’s protection, the psalmist says: <em>“You will not be afraid of anything dreadful by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,</em> <em>nor of the pestilence that walks in the gloom, nor of the destruction that despoils at midday.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:5-19:91:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 91:5, 6</a>) Since many evil deeds are committed under the cloak of darkness, the night can be a fear-inspiring time. Amid the spiritual darkness now covering the earth, our enemies often resort to covert acts in an effort to destroy our spirituality and stop our preaching work. But ‘we are not afraid of anything dreadful by night’ because Jehovah guards us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:64:1-19:64:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 64:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:121:4-19:121:4" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 121:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:2-23:60:2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Isaiah 60:2</a>.</p>

Moreover, we do not fear “the pestilence that walks in the gloom.” This is a figurative pestilence bred amid the gloom of this morally and religiously diseased world lying in Satan’s power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) It produces a deadly state of mind and heart, leaving people in the dark regarding Jehovah, his purposes, and his loving provisions. <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:4-54:6:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:4</a>) Amid this darkness, we are not fearful, since we enjoy spiritual light in abundance.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 43:3</a>.</p>

I shall protect him because he has come to know my name.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:14-19:91:14" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 91:14</a>) The phrase “I shall protect him” is literally, “I shall place him on high,” that is, out of reach. We take refuge in Jehovah as his worshipers especially because ‘we have set our affection on him.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:29-41:12:30" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:19-62:4:19" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:19</a>) In turn, God ‘provides us with escape’ from our enemies. Never will we be wiped off the earth. Rather, we will be saved because we know the divine name and call upon it in faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:11-45:10:13" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Romans 10:11-13</a>) And we are determined to ‘walk in Jehovah’s name forever.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:4:5-33:4:5" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Micah 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> Isaiah 43:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">20. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:1-19:91:16" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> concludes, what does Jehovah promise his faithful servant?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>As <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:1-19:91:16" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> concludes, Jehovah says of his faithful servant: <em>“He will call upon me, and I shall answer him. I shall be with him in distress. I shall rescue him and glorify him.</em> <em>With length of days I shall satisfy him, and I shall cause him to see salvation by me.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:91:15-19:91:16" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 91:15, 16</a>) When we call upon God in prayer according to his will, he answers us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:13-62:5:15" data-bid="57-1" class="b">1 John 5:13-15</a>) We have already passed through much distress because of the hostility fomented by Satan. But the words “I shall be with him in distress” prepare us for future trials and assure us that God will sustain us when this wicked system is destroyed.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21. How have the anointed already been glorified?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Despite Satan’s rabid opposition, the full complement of anointed ones among us will be glorified in heaven in Jehovah’s due time<wbr />—after a “length of days” on earth. Yet, God’s remarkable rescues have already brought spiritual glory to the anointed. And how honored they are to take the lead as Witnesses of Jehovah on earth in these last days! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12</a>) Jehovah’s greatest rescue of his people will occur during his great war of Armageddon when he vindicates his sovereignty and sanctifies his holy name.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:38:23-26:38:23" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 38:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="59-3" class="b"> Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="59-4" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">22. Who will ‘see salvation by Jehovah’?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Whether we are anointed Christians or their dedicated companions, we look to God for salvation. During “the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” those loyally serving God will be saved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/29:2:30-29:2:32" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Joel 2:30-32</a>) Those of us who will make up the “great crowd” of survivors into God’s new world and who remain faithful during a final test will be ‘satisfied by him with length of days’<wbr />—life without end. He will also resurrect multitudes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:7-66:20:15" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 20:7-15</a>) Jehovah will indeed take great delight in ‘causing us to see salvation’ through Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:3:8-19:3:8" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Psalm 3:8</a>) With such grand prospects before us, let us keep on looking to God for help in counting our days to his glory. By our words and deeds, may we continue to prove that Jehovah is our refuge.</p>

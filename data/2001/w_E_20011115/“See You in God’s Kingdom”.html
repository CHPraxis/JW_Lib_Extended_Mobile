<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ON JUNE 8, 1942, Franc Drozg penned these words minutes before being shot by Nazi soldiers. Why was he executed?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">According to the records in the Museum of National Liberation in Maribor, Slovenia, this 38-year-old blacksmith refused to join the <em>Wehrmannschaft, </em>a German paramilitary detachment in German-occupied Slovenia. He was a <em>Bibelforscher, </em>or Bible Student, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known in that area. Acting in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>, he would not support the Nazi war effort, declaring himself to be a subject of God’s Kingdom.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In his hometown of Ptuj, Franc was known as a zealous proclaimer of the good news of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Despite many hardships, he preached the good news without letup until his arrest in May 1942.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many Slovenian Witnesses of Jehovah were intensely persecuted by the Nazis. Franc was one of the first of them to be executed for his religious convictions. Like first-century Christians, he was strengthened by the words: “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:22-44:14:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 14:22</a>) His belief in the reality of that heavenly government was evident in his final words, “See you in God’s Kingdom.”</p>

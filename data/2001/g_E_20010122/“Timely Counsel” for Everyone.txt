“Timely Counsel” for Everyone
“I WAS moved to tears by the ‘oh so sound’ and timely counsel,” wrote a reader of The Secret of Family Happiness. “I’m truly touched and overwhelmed by its detail and sensitivity in dealing with (in principle) every trialsome situation that could develop in the family. . . . I stopped right in the middle of chapter 8 to write to you. I couldn’t wait any longer.”
This appreciative reader from North Carolina, U.S.A., added: “I pray that my family, as well as many others earth wide, will pay more than the usual attention to the things contained in this book.”
Millions earth wide have been benefited by this 192-page publication. There is something in the book for every member of the family—the husband, the wife, parents, children, and grandparents. Among its instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Help Your Teenager to Thrive,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”

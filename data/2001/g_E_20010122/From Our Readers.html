<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Land Mines  </strong>I was moved by the series “Land Mines—What Can Be Done?” (May 8, 2000) It is appalling that so many innocent civilians are being killed every year as a result of land mines.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I felt ashamed when I read about these fiendish devices that humans are using to harm their fellowmen. God has every reason to intervene and remove wickedness from our earth.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This series was a landmark, making the public aware of a major issue. The cover photo had strong drawing power.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Transfusion-Free Medical Treatment  </strong>The article “You Are Going to Die!” (May 8, 2000) reminded me of my father’s experience. Years ago he had a stroke while driving a car. His car rolled over, and when he regained consciousness, the doctor told him he had to have a blood transfusion. When my father refused, the doctor said: “If you don’t take this transfusion, you will die.” My father still refused. The next day the doctor came into his room and asked: “How are you?” My father said: “I’m alive!” My father is still alive and serving Jehovah to the best of his ability.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I have a rare blood cancer, and when it was diagnosed, the doctor told me that I was going to die in six months if I did not immediately begin taking blood transfusions. That was back in 1991. I found a doctor who has respected my beliefs on blood, and I made a personal decision to take, under his direction, weekly injections of erythropoietin, which has helped raise my blood count.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I read Leanne Karlinsky’s story, and as a physician, I was appalled by the inhumanity of those who neglected her postoperatively [because she refused blood transfusions]. It is hard to imagine such closed minds!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Fighting Despair  </strong>Since I suffer from depression, I read the article “The Bible’s Viewpoint: How to Cope With Despair” (May 8, 2000) as soon as I received it. As you said, talking with someone who will listen understandingly is very encouraging. I would like to express my thanks for your excellent articles.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Lactose Intolerant  </strong>My wife visited her doctor because she was experiencing severe symptoms. The doctor said that she might be lactose intolerant. I had never heard of that before, so we are grateful for the article “Are You Lactose Intolerant?” (May 8, 2000) This excellent information could not have come at a better time.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Brazil  </strong>The article “The Pantanal—A Fascinating Sanctuary” (September 8, 1999) aroused my desire to see this part of Jehovah’s creation firsthand. My sister and I thus planned a visit to Brazil, and the article “The Dramatic History of a ‘Land of Contrasts’” (May 8, 2000) came two weeks before we arrived there. It served as an excellent guide to the best places to visit.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Birds and Prisoners  </strong>I have had the joy of raising—and releasing back into the wild—a number of birds. The article “What Can a Bird Teach a Prisoner?” (May 8, 2000) brought to mind how even a small creation of Jehovah can teach us so much.</p>

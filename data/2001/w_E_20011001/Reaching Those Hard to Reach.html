<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES strive to contact everyone they can with the Kingdom message. At times, it takes an extraordinary effort to reach those who are seldom at home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) In this regard, a special pioneer minister in a South American country relates the following experience.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“One day I became aware that the state governor would be visiting the territory to which my wife and I are assigned. Since he was obviously one of those who are rarely at home, I wrote a letter to him and enclosed several Bible publications, including the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>and the books <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>and <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>My letter explained the purpose of each of these publications.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Because I was interested in finding out his reaction to the literature, I requested a meeting with him. Some weeks later I was granted a meeting, and I took along a copy of the video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—The Organization Behind the Name. </em>The meeting lasted about two hours. After watching the video with the governor, I asked him what he thought of it. He replied: ‘There is no other organization on earth like yours. I wish I had people like you who could help me complete my government projects!’ Then he asked if I had ever been to the world headquarters of our organization. I told him that although it had been my goal since I was 14 years old, I had not had the opportunity to visit our world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. It was one of those hard-to-reach goals. He looked at me intently for a moment. Then he said that he wanted me to have that opportunity. He took care of our legal permits and gave us the airplane tickets as a gift!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The governor now regularly receives the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. We hope that soon we will be able to start a Bible study with him.”</p>

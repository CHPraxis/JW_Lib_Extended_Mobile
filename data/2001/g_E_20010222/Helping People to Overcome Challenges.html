<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Sri Lanka received a letter from the secretary of the Youth and Human Resources Development Society, Eastern Province. The secretary requested certain back issues of <em>Awake! </em>and observed:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My colleagues and I have found the magazines you sent to me to be educational, informative, and motivating as well as logical and convincing. The magazines are not spreading Christian doctrine with any ulterior motive, as some erroneously would say. I find them excellent literature.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“There is an increasing demand for copies of <em>Awake! </em>(both new and old), and there is every indication that this demand will continue to grow in the coming months. The articles in your magazines provide knowledge for the elderly, youths, and children. They help all to overcome modern and future challenges that emanate from secularism.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At no time in history have people of all ages faced the challenges they do today. Many especially wonder what the future holds and if there is a God who cares about them. Such questions are answered in a satisfying way in the brochure <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>You can request a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

Come, Hear the Free Public Talk
“Who Are Teaching All Nations the Truth?”
A bishop once claimed: “Ultimate truth is beyond the grasp of all of us.” Is that view correct? Or is there a source of ultimate truth? Is it possible that the time will come when everyone will speak the truth?
Beginning this month the talk with the title featured above will be given at 189 three-day “Teachers of God’s Word” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the contiguous United States. In fact, it will be a highlight of some 2,000 such conventions in about 150 countries throughout the world.
Among the questions that will be addressed are: Where does truth originate? How is truth revealed? What is the principal textbook for revealing truth?
You may listen to this important talk at a convention near your home. Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally, or write to the publishers of this magazine for the location of the one nearest you. The February 15, 2001, issue of our companion magazine, The Watchtower, lists the addresses of all convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">The last time the subject of terrorism was featured on the cover of this journal, a familiar image was used—that of masked killers toting guns against a backdrop of a powerful explosion. Nowadays, however, the picture is different.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN THE light of dusk, a convoy of plain trucks moves quietly through the subdivisions. The trucks stop near a school building. Soon, a specially trained team of men in gas masks and chemical-protection suits trudge through the leafy shrubs. The only thing they know is that a small explosive device was detonated at a sports event in the school stadium, spreading fumes that sickened scores of spectators. In cooperation with local emergency personnel, the four men cautiously enter the contaminated area to find out what happened. What did the device unleash? Anthrax? Nerve gas?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The men walk slowly toward the arena, bringing with them an assortment of equipment for chemical analysis. They reach a small room where they find the remains of the explosive device. Their mission is delicate, requiring the handling of tiny detection kits and the moving of heavy objects.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Soon their masks steam up. The effort is taxing, even for trained men. In less than ten minutes, though, the residue is identified. “Positive hit on anthrax,” affirms the chemist accompanying them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>The Changing Face of Terror</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This event was not as dangerous as it sounds. It was a drill, testing the team’s response to a simulated gas attack somewhere in upstate New York. The group is one of the recently formed Weapons of <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams. Such teams are assigned to assess the scope and severity of a new breed of terrorist attacks by analyzing suspected germs, chemicals, or radioactive material.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This team is one of many worldwide that have been formed in response to the changing threats and challenges posed by terrorism.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Incidents in recent years suggest that acts of terror committed by independent groups or lone extremists are increasing. Although many terrorists still target military installations and diplomatic missions, some have expanded their list to include attacks on so-called soft targets, such as mass transportation systems, sporting events, busy urban locations, hotels, and tourist sites.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Confirming a shift in the behavior of terrorists, Porter Goss, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, observed: “We’re having to graduate from our old thinking about state-sponsored terrorism to terrorism’s new look. We’re facing increasingly cause-sponsored terrorism.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Terrorism’s emerging new look embraces actions and strategies that may be harder to prevent or combat. More and more, terrorists are able to utilize new technologies and secure independent financing. Reports <em>USA Today: </em>“New computer and communications technology and links with organized crime make terrorism even more difficult to combat.” The new look also involves new targets, forcing reporters and news analysts to coin such expressions as “cyberterrorism,” “bioterrorism,” and “ecoterrorism.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">How threatening is the new face of terrorism? Is your personal security threatened? Is there a solution to the plague of international terrorism? The following articles will shed some light on these questions.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p>
<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p13" data-pid="13">Views on what constitutes terrorism vary widely. For example, in countries torn apart by civil strife, acts of violence by one faction against another may be viewed either as legitimate acts of war or as terrorism, depending on which side is asked. In this series of articles, the word “terrorism” generally has reference to the use of violence as a means of coercion.</p></div>

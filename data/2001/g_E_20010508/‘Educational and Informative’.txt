‘Educational and Informative’
The above is how a 26-year-old man in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea described Awake!
In a letter to the local branch office, he wrote: “I commend you for printing the wonderful, factual, educational, and informative articles on subjects in your popular Awake! magazine.” The man explained: “Even though I’m not a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith, I thoroughly enjoy reading copies of the Awake! magazine, which I borrow from friends. . . . Each time I read a copy, I feel like writing to commend your worthwhile efforts. But when I’m about to, another arrives and keeps me busy again.”
This appreciative reader concluded: “According to my view, Awake! is really valuable to anyone who can read. From the depths of my heart, I wish to thank you countless times.”
Awake! provides enlightenment on many subjects. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful new world that will replace the present system of things.

“Watching the World” Goes to School
EDELMIRA, a 15-year-old girl in the United States, put Awake! magazine to good use at school. In a letter to the publishers, she wrote:
“Every Friday we have an assignment to report on a current event. I read the April 22, 2000, Awake! and decided to base mine on the ‘Watching the World’ item entitled ‘Tobacco Company Admits Smoking Causes Cancer.’ I wrote a summary and read it to the class. The teacher and the students paid close attention. When I finished, a classmate asked me—right in front of the class—if it took me long to find my information. I gave her the Awake! She eagerly began to read it, and a boy in our congregation who is in her next class said that when he saw her, she was still reading it. Now the girl says that she wants to receive every issue of both Awake! and its companion The Watchtower.
“This experience made me proud to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It taught me that we have so many opportunities to talk about Jehovah.” Edelmira concludes her letter: “I want to thank you for your hard work in making these magazines. Please keep printing ‘Watching the World’!”

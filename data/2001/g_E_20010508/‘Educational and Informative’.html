<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The above is how a 26-year-old man in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea described <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a letter to the local branch office, he wrote: “I commend you for printing the wonderful, factual, educational, and informative articles on subjects in your popular <em>Awake! </em>magazine.” The man explained: “Even though I’m not a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith, I thoroughly enjoy reading copies of the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, which I borrow from friends. . . . Each time I read a copy, I feel like writing to commend your worthwhile efforts. But when I’m about to, another arrives and keeps me busy again.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This appreciative reader concluded: “According to my view, <em>Awake! </em>is really valuable to anyone who can read. From the depths of my heart, I wish to thank you countless times.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>provides enlightenment on many subjects. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful new world that will replace the present system of things.</p>

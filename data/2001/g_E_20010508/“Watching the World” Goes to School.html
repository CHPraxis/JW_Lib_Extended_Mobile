<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EDELMIRA, a 15-year-old girl in the United States, put <em>Awake! </em>magazine to good use at school. In a letter to the publishers, she wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Every Friday we have an assignment to report on a current event. I read the April 22, 2000, <em>Awake! </em>and decided to base mine on the ‘Watching the World’ item entitled ‘Tobacco Company Admits Smoking Causes Cancer.’ I wrote a summary and read it to the class. The teacher and the students paid close attention. When I finished, a classmate asked me—right in front of the class—if it took me long to find my information. I gave her the <em>Awake! </em>She eagerly began to read it, and a boy in our congregation who is in her next class said that when he saw her, she was <em>still </em>reading it. Now the girl says that she wants to receive every issue of both <em>Awake! </em>and its companion <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“This experience made me proud to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It taught me that we have so many opportunities to talk about Jehovah.” Edelmira concludes her letter: “I want to thank you for your hard work in making these magazines. Please keep printing ‘Watching the World’!”</p>

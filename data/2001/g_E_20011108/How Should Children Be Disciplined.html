<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Problems occur when children are told that they are great no matter what they do,” says Canada’s <em>National Post </em>newspaper. Some parents believe that this approach builds self-esteem in their children. However, according to psychologist Roy Baumeister, “high self-esteem is fine when it’s based on genuine achievement, but parents should concentrate on teaching children self-control.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A parent who fears to correct his or her child when the child takes a false step is doing the young one harm. After all, correction is a method of instruction. As such, it teaches an erring child to avoid repeating mistakes. Of course, parents need to keep from giving correction in a way that is harsh and out of proportion to the wrong that has been committed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:46:28-24:46:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 46:28</a>) They should make sure that correction is not excessive. The Bible states: “You fathers, do not be exasperating your children, so that they do not become downhearted.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Bible, correction is consistently linked with love and mildness, not with anger and brutality. The skillful counselor should be “gentle toward all, . . . restrained under evil, instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:24-55:2:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:24, 25</a>) Therefore, parental correction should not be merely an emotional outlet for the parent. In no way does the Bible endorse using tactics that can harm a child.</p>

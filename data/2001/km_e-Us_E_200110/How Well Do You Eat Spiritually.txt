How Well Do You Eat Spiritually?
1 It has been said that ‘we are what we eat.’ Indeed, our physical strength and health are affected by our eating habits. Since Jesus said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth,” our spiritual eating habits likewise affect us for better or for worse. (Matt. 4:4) So, then, how well do you eat spiritually? Are you a picky eater? Do you eat on the run? Or do you delight in taking the time to enjoy regular, balanced, and nourishing spiritual meals?
2 Analyze Your Diet: Jehovah provides “food at the proper time” and “a banquet of well-oiled dishes,” through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45; Isa. 25:6) To benefit fully from these loving provisions, we must put forth the effort to eat well spiritually.
3 You might ask yourself: ‘Do I read the day’s text and comments each day? Do I daily read and meditate on the Bible? Do I prepare for congregation meetings by studying the material in advance? Have I read through our latest publications, including both volumes of Isaiah’s Prophecy​—Light for All Mankind?’
4 Jesus promised: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . . . Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.” (Matt. 5:3, 6) So eat well spiritually by filling your mind and heart with the knowledge of God.

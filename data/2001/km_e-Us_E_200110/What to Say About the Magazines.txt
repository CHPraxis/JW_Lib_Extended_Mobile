What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Oct. 15
“What would it take to create a better, happier world? [Allow for response.] Man has tried one type of government after another to improve things. But notice God’s view of this. [Read Jeremiah 10:23.] This article reveals ‘The Key to a Happy World,’ showing how this will soon come about.”

“Would you agree that people today seem to live under more pressure than ever before? [Allow for response.] The Bible foretold this. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1.] Many people find life so hard that they give up. This magazine gives real encouragement. It shows how to fight despair and make life worth living.”
The Watchtower Nov. 1
After mentioning a disturbing news item, ask: “Why do people do such wicked things? We all should know right from wrong, but people still do bad things. Why? [After a response, read Revelation 12:9.] This magazine explains how to protect ourselves by safeguarding our conscience.”

“Likely you agree that we live in violent times. [After a response, read 2 Timothy 3:3.] Often ‘fierce’ acts occur even in the family circle. This article, ‘Help for Battered Women,’ presents a message of hope. You may know someone with whom you can share it.”

Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2002
Instructions
During 2002 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], The Watchtower [w], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], and Reasoning From the Scriptures [rs] will be the basis for assignments.
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and a brief welcome. There is no need to give a preview of what is on the program. As the school overseer introduces each part, he will mention the subject to be developed. Proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on The Watchtower or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” When based on The Watchtower, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the “All Scripture” book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute talk, followed by a 3- to 5-minute oral review using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used.
The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested by the speaker.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. No theme is necessary. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother, whether the student is in the main school or in an auxiliary school. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on Reasoning From the Scriptures. Any setting that is appropriate for your territory may be used, and the participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the assigned theme and helps the householder to reason on the scriptures. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. Not the setting but the effective use of the Bible should be given prime consideration.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. The subject for this assignment will be based on Reasoning From the Scriptures. A brother or a sister may be given Assignment No. 4. When assigned to a brother, it should always be a talk. When assigned to a sister, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3.
BIBLE READING SCHEDULE: Everyone in the congregation is encouraged to follow the weekly Bible reading schedule, which amounts to reading about one page a day.
NOTE: For additional information and instruction regarding counsel, timing, written reviews, and the preparation of assignments, please see page 3 of the October 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry.

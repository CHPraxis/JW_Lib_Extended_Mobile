United by Divine Teaching​—A View of Real Brotherly Unity
A circuit overseer attended a Bible study conducted with a woman who had not yet begun attending congregation meetings. He invited her to watch the video United by Divine Teaching. That week she attended a meeting and said that she was very happy to be there. Why did this video get such quick results? She was impressed by its portrayal of our precious brotherly unity in action amid a violent, hateful world.​—John 13:35.
Watch this video to see and feel the peace and love that are enjoyed among Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth. Then meditate on these questions:
(1) Why was “Divine Teaching” a fitting theme for the 1993-94 conventions?​—Mic. 4:2.
(2) What has Bible truth meant to some families? What has it meant to yours?
(3) Why is it important to be taught by Jehovah?​—Ps. 143:10.
(4) What sort of challenges must be met to prepare for large international conventions?
(5) How have you seen Psalm 133:1 and Matthew 5:3 proved true at the Christian conventions you have attended?
(6) What public evidence is there of the powerful effects of divine teaching?​—Rev. 7:9.
(7) What was the largest mass baptism of true Christians ever?
(8) What words of Micah, Peter, and Jesus are being fulfilled among Jehovah’s Witnesses?
(9) What proves to you that a happy, united human family is not just a dream?
(10) To whom are you going to show this video, and why?
After seeing this video, one sister summed it up nicely: “The video will help me increasingly to keep in mind that so many Christian brothers and sisters throughout the world are at this very moment loyally serving Jehovah. . . . How precious is our brotherly unity!”​—Eph. 4:3.

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span><strong>What Is the Objective?</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Why do we conduct home Bible studies? Just to impart knowledge, to improve people’s lives, or to brighten their outlook for the future? No. Our ultimate objective is to make disciples of Jesus Christ! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 14:21</a>) That is why the ones with whom we study need to associate with the congregation. Their spiritual progress is directly linked to their appreciation for the Christian organization.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>How to Achieve It: </strong>Right from the start, continually urge the student to attend congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Explain how these will strengthen his faith, aid him in doing God’s will, and provide wholesome association with others who also wish to praise Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:13-19:27:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 27:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 32:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:35:18-19:35:18" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 35:18</a>) Your personal expressions of love and appreciation for the congregation and the meetings will stimulate his desire to attend.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>New ones need to understand that Jehovah’s organization is an international brotherhood. Show them the videos <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—The Organization Behind the Name </em>and <em>Our Whole Association of Brothers. </em>Help them to appreciate that Jehovah is using millions of dedicated individuals worldwide to accomplish his will. Let these new ones know that they are invited to serve God too.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>It is a cause for immense joy to see a Bible student become a true disciple of Jesus. That is our objective!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">3 John 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A circuit overseer attended a Bible study conducted with a woman who had not yet begun attending congregation meetings. He invited her to watch the video <em>United by Divine Teaching. </em>That week she attended a meeting and said that she was very happy to be there. Why did this video get such quick results? She was impressed by its portrayal of our precious brotherly unity in action amid a violent, hateful world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>.</p>

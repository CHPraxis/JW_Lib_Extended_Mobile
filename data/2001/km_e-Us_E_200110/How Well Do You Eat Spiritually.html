<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It has been said that ‘we are what we eat.’ Indeed, our physical strength and health are affected by our eating habits. Since Jesus said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth,” our spiritual eating habits likewise affect us for better or for worse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) So, then, how well do you eat spiritually? Are you a picky eater? Do you eat on the run? Or do you delight in taking the time to enjoy regular, balanced, and nourishing spiritual meals?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Analyze Your Diet: </strong>Jehovah provides “food at the proper time” and “a banquet of well-oiled dishes,” through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa. 25:6</a>) To benefit fully from these loving provisions, we must put forth the effort to eat well spiritually.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>You might ask yourself: ‘Do I read the day’s text and comments each day? Do I daily read and meditate on the Bible? Do I prepare for congregation meetings by studying the material in advance? Have I read through our latest publications, including both volumes of <em>Isaiah’s Prophecy​—Light for All Mankind?’</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus promised: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need . . . Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:6-40:5:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6</a>) So eat well spiritually by filling your mind and heart with the knowledge of God.</p>

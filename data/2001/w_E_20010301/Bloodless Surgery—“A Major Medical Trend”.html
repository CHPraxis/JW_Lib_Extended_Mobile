<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">UNDER the heading “‘Bloodless’ Surgery,” <em>Maclean’s </em>magazine reported that doctors across Canada have been “developing new techniques that, over the past five years, have turned so-called bloodless surgery into a major medical trend.” Brian Muirhead, an anesthesiologist at Winnipeg’s Health Sciences Centre, is one of them. What prompted his search for alternative nonblood management?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1986, Dr. Muirhead took on the challenge of operating on a 70-year-old man with a bleeding ulcer who, because of his Bible-based beliefs as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, had asked for treatment that did not require a blood transfusion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) Dr. Muirhead “resorted to a little-used method of pumping saline solution into the patient to keep his blood pressure up,” reports <em>Maclean’s. </em>“The procedure was a success, and it reinforced Muirhead’s growing belief that ‘we were giving too many blood transfusions. I thought it was time to look at alternatives.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The quest for bloodless surgery was “spurred both by concerns over the future supply of donated blood<wbr />—and by many patients’ fears of getting a disease virus from a transfusion.” Thanks to the research by innovative doctors, not only Jehovah’s Witnesses but many others have benefited. “Besides eliminating the need for transfusions in many cases, bloodless surgery reduces the risk<wbr />—however slight—<wbr />of infection from tainted blood,” says <em>Maclean’s. </em>But even “clean” blood can pose a risk of infection by temporarily suppressing patients’ immune systems.</p>

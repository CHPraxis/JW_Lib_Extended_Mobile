“Planetary Overload”—Is There an Answer?
Global population reached three billion in 1960. By the year 2000, that total had doubled. “The tide of humanity is swelling by five new births every second,” according to the Vancouver Sun newspaper. The world now has 23 megacities with populations in excess of ten million inhabitants, and by 2025 the world’s population is projected to reach ten billion!
Scientists express concern over the stress that such growth will have on earth’s already fragile ecosystems. Each new citizen of the world requires food, water, and shelter, and as the population grows, consumption and waste increase. The challenge is that of managing the uncontrolled growth of supercities. According to the Sun, these supercities ‘suck in resources from vast hinterlands and pump out vast quantities of toxic wastes.’

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>March: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or <em>Require </em>brochure, with a view to starting home Bible studies. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>or <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>Concentrate on starting home Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held on Sunday, April 8, 2001. No meetings other than those for field service will be held on that day. The elders can make appropriate arrangements for the <em>Watchtower </em>Study to be conducted at another time.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation’s monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all who are interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more people planning to visit the Society’s facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the Society’s facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The Society will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the <em>body of elders only </em>in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:101997881/1-4:393$p/E:101997882/$p/E:101997883/"><em>Awake! </em>of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12;</a> in <a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:101988760/1-4$p/E:101988761/$p/E:101988762/$p/E:101988763/"><em>Awake! </em>of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14;</a> and on the chart found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:101991282/26:93-29:84"><em>Awake! </em>of April 22, 1991, page 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE apostle Paul saw the need to administer some correction to first-century Christians in Galatia. Likely to forestall any resentment, he asked: “Well, then, have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:16-48:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In ‘telling the truth,’ Paul had not become their enemy. He was, in fact, acting in harmony with the Bible principle: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:6-20:27:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:6</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) He knew that the pride of erring ones could be wounded. Yet, he was aware that to stand between a sinner and the discipline he needs could have the effect of denying that one an expression of Jehovah God’s love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5-7</a>) Therefore, as a faithful friend with the long-term interests of the congregation at heart, Paul did not shrink back from offering corrective counsel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are fulfilling their commission “to make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe <em>all </em>the things [Jesus Christ has] commanded.” In doing so, these sincere Christians do not compromise Bible truths that expose and condemn doctrinal error and unchristian behavior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:9-40:15:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 15:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:9-40:23:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 23:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) Rather than becoming enemies to be rejected, they are manifesting the interest of genuine friends.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">With divinely inspired insight, the psalmist wrote: “Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:5-19:141:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 141:5</a>.</p>

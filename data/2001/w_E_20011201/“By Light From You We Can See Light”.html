<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LIGHT is something we often take for granted until there is a power failure and our neighborhood is plunged into darkness. Happily, our celestial “power station”<wbr />—the sun—<wbr />is totally reliable. And thanks to light from the sun, we can see, eat, breathe, and live.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since light is essential for life, we should not be surprised to read in Genesis that light appeared on the first creative day. “God proceeded to say: ‘Let light come to be.’ Then there came to be light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:3-1:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:3</a>) Reverent men like King David have always recognized Jehovah as the source of life and light. “With you is the source of life,” David wrote. “By light from you we can see light.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David’s words apply both literally and figuratively. The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>points out: “Light, certainly, is responsible for the sensation of sight.” It then adds: “More information reaches the human brain through the eyes than through any other sense organ.” Since much of what we learn depends on the gift of sight<wbr />—which needs light to function properly—<wbr />light is also used in the Scriptures in a figurative way.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thus, Jesus told his disciples: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:12-43:8:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 8:12</a>) The figurative light referred to by Jesus was the message of truth he preached, which could illuminate the minds and hearts of his listeners. After years of spiritual darkness, Jesus’ disciples could finally understand God’s purpose for mankind and the hope of the Kingdom. This was truly “light of life,” since that knowledge could lead to eternal life. “This means everlasting life,” Jesus said in prayer to his heavenly Father, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) May we never take for granted this spiritual light!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Where was Daniel when the three Hebrews were tested before the huge image that Nebuchadnezzar had erected on the plain of Dura?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible does not say, so no man today can establish Daniel’s whereabouts during that test.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some have suggested that Daniel’s official rank or his standing in Nebuchadnezzar’s favor was higher than that of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and that Daniel therefore was not obliged to go to the plain of Dura. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:49-27:2:49" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 2:49</a> does indicate that for a time he had a position higher than that of his three companions. But we cannot prove that this exempted him from assembling with the others before the image.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Attempting to explain Daniel’s absence, others have said that he might have been away on an official assignment or that he was sick and thus unable to attend. However, the Bible does not say that. In any case, Daniel’s course must not have been open to criticism, for if it had been, jealous Babylonian officials would undoubtedly have used it to bring accusations against him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:8-27:3:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 3:8</a>) Both before and after this episode, Daniel proved himself to be an integrity keeper, loyal to God no matter what challenge he faced. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:8-27:1:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:5:17-27:5:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 5:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:4-27:6:4" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 6:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:10-27:6:11" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) So even though the Bible does not say why Daniel was not present on the plain of Dura, we can be confident that he was uncompromisingly faithful to Jehovah God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 14:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:33-58:11:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:33</a>.</p>

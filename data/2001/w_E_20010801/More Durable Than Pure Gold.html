<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOLD is much sought after for its beauty and durability. Much of its desirability lies in the fact that it remains bright and untarnished seemingly indefinitely. This is because gold is resistant to attacks by water, oxygen, sulfur, and almost everything else. Many gold artifacts discovered in sunken vessels and elsewhere still retain their luster after hundreds of years.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Interestingly, however, the Bible states that there is something that is more durable and “of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:7-60:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:7</a>) Gold “proved,” or refined, by fire and other processes can attain 99.9 percent purity. Yet, even refined gold perishes, or dissolves, when exposed to aqua regia (royal water), a mixture of three parts hydrochloric acid and one part nitric acid. Thus, the Bible is scientifically correct in stating that ‘gold perishes.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">By contrast, true Christian faith ‘preserves alive the soul.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:39-58:10:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:39</a>) Men can kill a person who has strong faith, as they did with Jesus Christ. But possessors of genuine faith are given this promise: “Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:2:10-66:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>) Those who die in faith remain in God’s memory, and he will resurrect them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) No amount of gold can accomplish that. In this respect, faith is truly of much greater value than gold. For faith to have such excelling value, however, it must also be proved, or tested. In fact, it is ‘the tested quality of faith’ that Peter said is of greater value than gold. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be happy to help you to study the Bible in order for you to develop and maintain strong faith in the true God, Jehovah, and in his Son, Jesus Christ. This, according to Jesus, “means everlasting life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

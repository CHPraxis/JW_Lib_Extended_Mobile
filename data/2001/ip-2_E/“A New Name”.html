Their whole-souled attitude is seen in the zealous activity of millions of faithful individuals supported by traveling overseers and their wives; volunteers in the various Bethel homes and printing facilities of Jehovah’s Witnesses; missionaries; and special, regular, and auxiliary pioneers. In addition, they work hard in constructing new Kingdom Halls, visiting the sick, assisting individuals who face challenging medical situations, <span id="page344" class="pageNum" data-no="344" data-before-text="344"></span>and providing timely relief to victims of disasters and accidents.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The new name also makes Jehovah’s organization attractive to honesthearted people. Multitudes flock to it, and the way is kept open for them. Isaiah’s prophecy states: <strong><em>“Pass out, pass out through the gates, you men. Clear the way of the people. Bank up, bank up the highway. Rid it of stones. </em></strong><strong><em>Raise up a signal for the peoples.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:10-23:62:10" data-bid="45-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 62:10</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> In the first instance, this call likely refers to passing out of the gates of the cities of Babylonia in order to return to Jerusalem. The returnees are to clear stones out of the way to make the journey easier and to raise up a signal to show the way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:12-23:11:12" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Since 1919, anointed Christians have been set apart for divine service and are traveling “the Way of Holiness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:8-23:35:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:8</a>) They were the first to walk on the spiritual highway out of Babylon the Great.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>In 537 B.C.E., Jerusalem became the signal that beckoned the Jewish remnant to return and rebuild the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:22-23:49:22" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:22</a>) In 1919 when the anointed remnant were delivered from bondage to false religion, they did not wander aimlessly. They knew their destination, for Jehovah had established a signal for them. What signal? The same signal foretold at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:10-23:11:10" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:10</a>, which reads: “It must occur in that day that there will be the root of Jesse that will be standing up as a signal for the peoples.” The apostle Paul applies these words to Jesus.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>The new name that Jehovah grants to his wifelike organization has to do with the eternal salvation of <span id="page347" class="pageNum" data-no="347" data-before-text="347"></span>her children. Isaiah writes: <strong><em>“Look! Jehovah himself has caused it to be heard to the farthest part of the earth: ‘Say, you people, to the daughter of Zion, “Look! Your salvation is coming. Look! The reward he gives is with him, and the wages he pays are before him.”’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:11-23:62:11" data-bid="55-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 62:11</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> Salvation came to the Jews when Babylon fell and they returned to their homeland. But these words point to something greater. Jehovah’s declaration brings to mind Zechariah’s prophecy regarding Jerusalem: “Be very joyful, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Look! Your king himself comes to you. He is righteous, yes, saved; humble, and riding upon an ass, even upon a full-grown animal the son of a she-ass.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a>.</p>

Since his enthronement in 1914, Jesus is also Jehovah’s appointed Judge and Executioner. In 1918, three and a half years after his enthronement, he cleansed Jehovah’s spiritual temple, as represented on earth by the congregation of anointed Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:1-39:3:5" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Malachi 3:1-5</a>) His being raised as a signal marked the beginning of a great ingathering of people from all over the earth, in support of the Messianic Kingdom. Following the ancient pattern, “salvation” came to the Israel of God when they were liberated from Babylon the Great in 1919. “The reward” or “the wages” in store for the self-sacrificing harvest workers is either immortal life in heaven or eternal life on earth. All who stay faithful can be confident that their “labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>.</p>

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">  When people marry, they bring their own expectations to the marriage union. But what are God’s expectations? The institution of marriage originated with him. What was his purpose for it?</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">  One indication of God’s perspective comes from his relationship with the nation of Israel. Isaiah portrays this relationship as a marriage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:1-23:62:5" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Isaiah 62:1-5</a>) Notice what Jehovah God as a “husband” does for his “bride.” He protects and sanctifies her.

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">  In the Christian Greek Scriptures, Paul echoes Isaiah’s description of the relationship between Jehovah and Israel when he compares the relationship of a husband and wife to that of Christ and the congregation of anointed Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:21-49:5:27" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:21-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">  Paul encouraged Christians to imitate in their marriages the relationship between Jesus and the congregation. There can be no greater love than that shown by Jehovah toward Israel and that shown by Christ toward the congregation. Those symbolic relationships provide a lofty model for a successful and happy marriage between Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:33" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:28-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">“‘YOU are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘even my servant whom I have chosen.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a>) This declaration by Jehovah, recorded by the prophet Isaiah in the eighth century B.C.E., shows that Jehovah’s ancient covenant people were a nation of witnesses. They were God’s chosen servant. Some 2,600 years later, in 1931, anointed Christians publicly declared that these words applied to them. They took the name Jehovah’s Witnesses and wholeheartedly accepted the responsibilities associated with being God’s earthly servant.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jehovah’s Witnesses earnestly desire to please God. For this reason, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">the 42nd chapter of the book of Isaiah</a> is of intense interest to each one of them, for it provides a portrait of a servant whom Jehovah approves and another of a servant whom he rejects. Considering this prophecy and its fulfillment gives insight into what leads to God’s approval and what leads to his disfavor.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Through Isaiah, Jehovah prophesies the coming of a servant whom he himself will choose: <strong><em>“Look!

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Who is the Servant referred to here? We are not left in doubt. We find these words quoted in the Gospel of Matthew and applied to Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:15-40:12:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 12:15-21</a>) Jesus is the beloved Servant, the “chosen one.” When did Jehovah put his spirit upon Jesus? In 29 C.E., at the time of Jesus’ baptism. The inspired record describes that baptism and says that after Jesus rose from the water, “the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: ‘You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.’” In this way Jehovah personally identified his beloved Servant. Jesus’ subsequent ministry and the miraculous works that he performed proved that Jehovah’s spirit was indeed upon him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 3:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:14-42:4:21" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 4:14-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Matthew 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5. Why was clarification of justice needed in the first century C.E.?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jehovah’s Chosen One was to “bring forth,” or make stand out, true justice. “What justice is he will make clear to the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:18-40:12:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 12:18</a>) How this was needed in the first century C.E.! The Jewish religious leaders taught a distorted view of justice and righteousness. They sought <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>to attain righteousness by following a rigid code of laws​—many of their own making. Their legalistic justice was void of mercy and compassion.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. In what ways did Jesus make true justice known?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In contrast, Jesus revealed God’s view of justice. By what he taught and how he lived, Jesus showed that true justice is compassionate and merciful. Just consider his famous Sermon on the Mount. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:1-40:7:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew, chapters 5-7</a>) What a masterful explanation of how justice and righteousness should be practiced! When we read the Gospel accounts, are we not touched by Jesus’ compassion for the poor and afflicted?

They were like a smoldering flaxen wick, their last spark of life almost smothered. Jesus neither broke a “crushed reed” nor extinguished “a dim flaxen wick.” Rather, his loving and compassionate words and actions lifted up the hearts of the meek.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Why, though, does the prophecy say that Jesus would ‘not cry out or raise his voice, and he would not let his voice be heard in the street’? Because he did not promote himself, as did many in his day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:5-40:6:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 6:5</a>) When curing a leper, he told the healed man: “See that you tell nobody a thing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:40-41:1:44" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mark 1:40-44</a>) Rather than seeking publicity and having people reach conclusions on the basis of secondhand reports, Jesus wanted them to discern for themselves on the basis of solid evidence that he was the Christ, Jehovah’s anointed Servant.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. (a) How did Jesus bring forth “justice to the nations”? (b) What does Jesus’ illustration about the neighborly Samaritan teach us about justice?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span><sup>8 </sup>The Chosen Servant was to bring forth “justice to the nations.” This Jesus did. Apart from emphasizing the compassionate nature of godly justice, Jesus taught that it should embrace all people. On one occasion Jesus reminded a man versed in the Law that he should love God and his neighbor. The man asked Jesus: “Who really is my neighbor?” Perhaps he expected Jesus to answer: “Your fellow Jew.” But Jesus told the parable of the neighborly Samaritan. In the parable a Samaritan came to the aid of a man set upon by robbers, while a Levite and a priest had refused to help. The questioner had to admit that on this occasion the despised Samaritan was the neighbor, not the Levite or the priest. Jesus concluded his illustration with the advice: “Be doing the same yourself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:25-42:10:37" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Leviticus 19:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Since Jesus made clear the nature of true justice, his disciples learned to display this quality. So must we. First of all, we need to accept God’s standards of good and bad, since he has the right to determine what is just and righteous. As we strive to do things Jehovah’s way, our upright conduct will speak volumes about what true justice is.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">10. Why does displaying justice entail sharing in the preaching and teaching work?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>We also display true justice when we diligently engage <span id="page36" class="pageNum" data-no="36" data-before-text="36"></span>in the preaching and teaching activity. Jehovah has generously provided lifesaving knowledge of himself, his Son, and his purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) It would not be right or just to keep that knowledge to ourselves. “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it,” says Solomon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:27</a>) Let us wholeheartedly share what we know about God with all people, regardless of their racial, ethnic, or national background.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>

Many today face disheartening problems and are in need of compassion and encouragement. Even some dedicated Christians may be so battered by circumstances that they come to resemble crushed reeds or smoldering wicks. Do they not need our support? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:32-42:22:32" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 22:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:23-44:11:23" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 11:23</a>) How refreshing to be part of an association of true Christians, who try to imitate Jesus in exercising justice!</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">12. Why can we be confident that justice for all will soon become a reality?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Will there ever be justice for all? Yes, indeed.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:6-23:47:7" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:15-38:1:15" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Zechariah 1:15</a>) How it must hurt the true God to see his people suffer! But he withholds taking action until his due time. Then, he labors​—like a woman giving birth—​to liberate his covenant people and brings them forth as an independent nation. To accomplish this, in 539 B.C.E., he dries up and devastates Babylon and her defenses.</p>

Well, for a long time now​—for centuries—​Jehovah has let the nations go their own way. However, his appointed time for settling matters is close. In modern times he has raised up a people to bear witness to his name. Leveling any opposition against them, he has smoothed the way for them to worship him “with spirit and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="39-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) He promised: “I will not leave them,” and he has kept his word.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>God’s Chosen Servant, Jesus Christ, remained faithful to death. Jehovah’s people Israel, though, prove to be an unfaithful servant, deaf and blind in a spiritual sense. Addressing them, Jehovah says: <strong><em>“Hear, you deaf ones; and look forth to see, you blind ones.</em></strong> <strong><em>Who is blind, if not my servant, and who is deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as the one rewarded, or blind as the servant of Jehovah?</em></strong> <strong><em>It was a case of seeing many things, but you did not keep watching.

Rather, may we seek Jehovah’s approval by imitating Christ Jesus, the Servant whom Jehovah himself approved. Like Jesus, may we make true justice known by what we say and do. In this way, we will remain among Jehovah’s people, serving as light bearers who praise the true God and give him glory.</p>

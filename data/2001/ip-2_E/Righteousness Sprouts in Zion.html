However, while that prophecy clearly had a fulfillment in 537 B.C.E., it is fulfilled in greater detail at a later period. The more detailed fulfillment involves Jesus and <span id="page322" class="pageNum" data-no="322" data-before-text="322"></span>his followers in the first century and Jehovah’s people in modern times.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Isaiah writes: <strong><em>“The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me, for the reason that Jehovah has anointed me to tell good news to the meek ones.

Likely, in the first instance it is Isaiah, who is inspired by God to record good news for the captives in Babylon. However, Jesus pointed to the most important fulfillment when he applied Isaiah’s words to himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-21</a>) Yes, Jesus was sent forth to tell good news to the meek, and to this end he was anointed with holy spirit at his baptism.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

At Pentecost 33 C.E., about 120 of these were anointed with holy spirit and became spiritual sons of God.

Those 120 were the first of 144,000 to be anointed in this way. The final ones of this group are still active on earth today. Hence, for about 2,000 years, anointed followers of Jesus have been witnessing “about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:21-44:20:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>There is a timetable for preaching the good news.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>In the first century, the year of goodwill for the Jewish nation started in 29 C.E. when Jesus began his earthly ministry.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-22</a>) We today are living in another <span id="page325" class="pageNum" data-no="325" data-before-text="325"></span>year of goodwill, one that began with the establishment of God’s Kingdom in the heavens in 1914.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Jews who return from Babylon realize that Jehovah has performed a great deed in their behalf. Their mourning as captives turns into exultation and praise because they are finally free. Thus, Isaiah fulfills his prophetic commission, that is, <strong><em>“to assign to those mourning over Zion, to give them a headdress instead of ashes, the oil of exultation instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of the downhearted spirit;</em></strong> <strong><em>and they must be called big trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, for him to be beautified.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:3-23:61:3" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 61:3</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

Such a change was first experienced by Jesus’ disciples when their mourning over his death turned to rejoicing over their anointing with holy spirit by their resurrected Lord. Soon after, a similar change was experienced by 3,000 meek individuals who responded to the preaching of those newly anointed Christians and got baptized at Pentecost 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 2:41</a>) How good it was to be confident of having Jehovah’s blessing!

In a similar way, from 1919 onward Jesus Christ caused the remnant of his anointed brothers to rebuild “places desolate for generation after generation.” For centuries the clergy of Christendom had failed to impart the knowledge of Jehovah, replacing it with man-made traditions and unscriptural doctrines. The anointed Christians cleaned out of their congregations practices that were tainted by false religion so that the restoration of true worship could go forward.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>What Jehovah says next provides another reason for <span id="page332" class="pageNum" data-no="332" data-before-text="332"></span>Christians today to rejoice: <strong><em>“I, Jehovah, am loving justice, hating robbery along with unrighteousness. </em></strong><strong><em>And I will give their wages in trueness, and an indefinitely lasting covenant I shall conclude toward them.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:8-23:61:8" data-bid="45-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 61:8</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> Through their study of the Bible, the anointed remnant learned to love justice and hate wickedness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:12-20:6:19" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:12-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:20-20:11:20" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 11:20</a>) They learned to “beat their swords into plowshares,” remaining neutral in mankind’s wars and political upheavals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>) They also left behind God-dishonoring practices, such as slander, adultery, theft, and drunkenness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Because anointed Christians share their Creator’s love of justice, Jehovah has given them “their wages in trueness.” One such ‘wage’ is an indefinitely lasting covenant​—the new covenant—​which Jesus announced to his followers on the night before his death. It is on the basis of this covenant that they became a spiritual nation, God’s special people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Luke 22:20</a>) Under it, Jehovah will apply all the benefits of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, including the forgiveness of sins for both anointed and all other faithful ones of mankind.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>Exulting in the Blessings of Jehovah</strong></p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">24. Who from among the nations are “the offspring” who come to be blessed, and how have they become “offspring”?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Some among the nations have recognized Jehovah’s blessing on his people. This was foretold by Jehovah’s promise: <strong><em>“Their offspring will actually be known even among the nations, and their descendants in among the peoples. All those seeing them will recognize them, that they are the offspring whom Jehovah has blessed.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:9-23:61:9" data-bid="50-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 61:9</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Members of the Israel of God, anointed Christians, have been active among the nations during Jehovah’s year of goodwill. Today those who have responded to their <span id="page333" class="pageNum" data-no="333" data-before-text="333"></span>ministry number into the millions. By working closely with the Israel of God, those from the nations have the privilege of becoming “the offspring whom Jehovah has blessed.” Their happy condition is visible to all mankind.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">25, 26. How do all Christians echo the sentiments expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:10-23:61:10" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:10</a>?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>All Christians, both anointed and other sheep, look forward to praising Jehovah eternally. They wholeheartedly agree with the prophet Isaiah, who says under inspiration: <strong><em>“Without fail I shall exult in Jehovah. My soul will be joyful in my God. For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; </em></strong><strong><em>with the sleeveless coat of righteousness he has enwrapped me,</em></strong> <strong><em>like the bridegroom who, in a priestly way, puts on a headdress, and like the bride who decks herself with her ornamental things.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:10-23:61:10" data-bid="51-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 61:10</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Clad in “the sleeveless coat of righteousness,” anointed Christians are determined to remain pure and clean in Jehovah’s eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:1-47:11:2" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:1, 2</a>) Declared righteous by Jehovah with a view to inheriting heavenly life, they will never return to the desolate estate of Babylon the Great, from which they have been liberated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:9-45:5:9" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Romans 5:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:30-45:8:30" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 8:30</a>) The garments of salvation are priceless to them. Their other sheep companions are similarly determined to observe Jehovah God’s elevated standards of pure worship. Having “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,” they are declared righteous and will survive “the great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> James 2:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:25-59:2:25" data-bid="54-3" class="b"> 25</a>) Until then, they imitate their anointed companions in avoiding any contamination by Babylon the Great.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">27. (a) During the Millennial Reign, what noteworthy “sprouting” will there be? (b) How is righteousness already sprouting among mankind?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Today Jehovah’s worshipers delight to be in a spiritual paradise. Soon they will also enjoy Paradise in a physical <span id="page334" class="pageNum" data-no="334" data-before-text="334"></span>sense. We look forward with all our hearts to that time, which is vividly described in the closing words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:11" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 61</a>: <strong><em>“As the earth itself brings forth its sprout, and as the garden itself makes the things that are sown in it sprout, in like manner the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will cause the sprouting of righteousness and of praise in front of all the nations.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:11-23:61:11" data-bid="56-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 61:11</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>During Christ’s Millennial Reign, the earth will experience “the sprouting of righteousness.” Humans will shout triumphantly, and righteousness will expand to the ends of the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:9-23:26:9" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:9</a>) We, however, do not have to wait for that glorious day in order to give praise in front of all the nations. Righteousness is already sprouting among the millions who give glory to the God of heaven and publish the good news about his Kingdom. Even now our faith and our hope give us every reason to exult in the blessings of our God.</p>

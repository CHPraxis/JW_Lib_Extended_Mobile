<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">LIBERATION! Can there be a more joyful prospect for a captive people? Since a major theme in the book of Isaiah is liberation and restoration, it is not surprising that aside from the Psalms, this Bible book contains more expressions of joy than any other. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:1-23:52:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 52</a> especially gives reason for God’s people to rejoice.

During the first world war, however, her representatives on earth​—anointed Christians—​unwittingly broke Jehovah’s law because they did not properly understand true Christian neutrality. Losing divine favor, they came into spiritual captivity to “Babylon the Great,” the world <span id="page182" class="pageNum" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>empire of false religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5</a>) Their condition of being in slavery climaxed in June 1918 when eight staff members of the Watch Tower Society were imprisoned on false charges, including conspiracy. At that point the organized preaching of the good news virtually stopped. In 1919, however, a clarion call to spiritual wakefulness was sounded forth. Anointed Christians began to separate themselves more completely from the moral and spiritual uncleanness of Babylon the Great. They rose from the dust of captivity, and “Jerusalem above” came to have the splendor of a “holy city” where spiritual uncleanness is not allowed.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Both in 537 B.C.E. and in 1919 C.E., Jehovah had a perfect right to liberate his people. Isaiah explains: <strong><em>“This is what Jehovah has said: ‘It was for nothing that you people were sold, and it will be without money that you will be repurchased.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:3-23:52:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 52:3</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Neither ancient Babylon nor Babylon the Great paid anything when they took possession of God’s covenant people as slaves. Since no transaction involving money took place, Jehovah was still the legal Owner of his people. Should he have felt indebted to anybody? Of course not. In both cases, Jehovah could rightly repurchase his worshipers without giving any compensation to their captors.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:13-23:45:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah’s enemies had not learned any lessons from history. We read: <strong><em>“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: ‘It was to Egypt that my people went down in the first instance to reside there as aliens; and without cause Assyria, for its part, oppressed them.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:4-23:52:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 52:4</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Pharaoh of Egypt enslaved the Israelites, <span id="page183" class="pageNum" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>who had been invited to his land to reside as guests.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. What effect has the captivity of Jehovah’s people had on his name?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The captive condition of Jehovah’s people has an effect on his name, as the prophecy shows: <strong><em>“‘Now, what interest do I have here?’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘For my people were taken for nothing.

What concern of his is it that Israel is enslaved in Babylon? <span id="page184" class="pageNum" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>Jehovah must act because Babylon has taken his people captive and has howled over them in triumph. Such bragging has led to Babylon’s treating Jehovah’s name disrespectfully. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:20-26:36:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 36:20, 21</a>) She has failed to recognize that the desolate condition of Jerusalem is on account of Jehovah’s displeasure toward his people. Rather, Babylon has viewed the enslavement of the Jews as evidence of the weakness of their God. The Babylonian coregent Belshazzar even mocks Jehovah by using vessels from His temple during a feast in honor of Babylonian gods.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:1-27:5:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 5:1-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>How does all of this apply to “Jerusalem above”? Ever since apostasy took root among professed Christians, it could be said that “the name of God is being blasphemed on account of [those] people among the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:24-45:2:24" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 20:29, 30</a>) For that matter, because of superstition the Jews eventually started to avoid using the divine name. Soon after the death of the apostles, apostate Christians followed suit and ceased to use God’s personal name. The apostasy resulted in the development of Christendom, a major part of Babylon the Great.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">9, 10. What deeper understanding of Jehovah’s standards and his name have God’s covenant people of modern times come to have?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>When the Greater Cyrus, Jesus Christ, freed God’s covenant people from captivity to Babylon the Great in 1919, they came to a better understanding of Jehovah’s requirements. They had already cleansed themselves of many teachings of Christendom that have their roots in pre-Christian paganism, such as the Trinity, immortality of <span id="page185" class="pageNum" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>the soul, and eternal torment in a fiery hell. Now they set out to rid themselves of all traces of Babylonish influence. They also came to realize the importance of maintaining strict neutrality regarding this world’s partisan affairs. They even wanted to purify themselves of whatever bloodguilt some might have incurred.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The modern-day servants of God also came to have a deeper understanding of the importance of Jehovah’s name. In 1931 they adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses, thus publicly announcing that they supported Jehovah and his name. Moreover, through the publication of the <em>New World Translation </em>since 1950, Jehovah’s Witnesses have restored the divine name to its proper place in the Bible. Yes, they have come to appreciate Jehovah’s name and are making it known to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Now our attention is turned back to Zion when she is still in her desolate state.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 15:3</a>) But the exclamation “Your God has become king!” is appropriate because Babylon’s fall and the royal proclamation to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem and restore pure worship there constitute a new expression of Jehovah’s kingship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:1-19:97:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 97:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. Who took the lead in “bringing good news,” and how?</p>

Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s greatest messenger of peace. While on earth, he preached the good news that there would be a release from all the effects of sin inherited from Adam, including sickness and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:35-40:9:35" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 9:35</a>) Jesus set a zealous example in publishing this good news of something better, seizing every opportunity to teach people about the Kingdom of God.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>In his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul quotes <span id="page187" class="pageNum" data-no="187" data-before-text="187"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:7</a> to highlight the importance of the work of preaching the good news. He poses a series of thought-provoking questions, including ‘How will people hear without someone to preach?’ He then says: “Just as it is written: ‘How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 10:14, 15</a>) Paul thus expands the application of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:7</a>, using the plural form “those” instead of the singular “one,” which appears in the original text of Isaiah. Imitating Jesus Christ, all Christians are messengers of the good news of peace. How are their feet “comely”? Isaiah speaks as if the herald is approaching Jerusalem from the nearby mountains of Judah. From afar, it is impossible to see the messenger’s feet. Rather, the focus here is on the messenger, the feet standing for the messenger himself. Just as Jesus and his disciples were a beautiful sight to meek ones in the first century, present-day Witnesses are a welcome sight to humble ones who heed the lifesaving message of good news.</p>

In that year at a convention in Cedar Point, Ohio, J. F. Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society, stirred his listeners with a talk entitled “Address to Co-laborers.” The talk, based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:7 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:2-66:15:2" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Revelation 15:2</a>, encouraged all present to take up the preaching work.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Does the cry “Your God has become king!” elicit a response? Yes. Isaiah records: <strong><em>“Listen!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:11-24:25:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>) So the “watchmen” who raise their voice must be those Israelites who get the news in advance regarding Zion’s restoration and who become responsible for passing the news on to the rest of Zion’s children. Upon seeing Jehovah give Babylon into the hands of Cyrus in 539 B.C.E., the watchmen have no doubt in their minds that Jehovah is liberating his people. Together with those who respond to their call, the watchmen keep crying out joyfully, in unison, letting others hear the good news.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">16. Whom do the watchmen see “eye into eye,” and in what sense?</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>To share in such a unifying work takes humility and brotherly love.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1, 2</a>) Clearly, Jehovah has his hand in this. He has “bared his holy arm,” as if rolling up his sleeves in order to apply himself to the task of saving his people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:2-15:1:3" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20. What has resulted and will yet result from Jehovah’s baring his holy arm in modern times?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span id="page191" class="pageNum" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span><sup>20 </sup>In these “last days,” Jehovah has bared his holy arm in order to revive the anointed remnant, the “two witnesses” of the book of Revelation.

Eventually, Jehovah will bare his holy arm to bring salvation to his people at “Har–Magedon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Then, “all the ends of the earth must see the salvation of our God.”</p>

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">21. (a) What is required of those “carrying the utensils of Jehovah”? (b) Why is there no reason for Jews departing from Babylon to panic?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Those who get out of Babylon to return to Jerusalem have a requirement to meet. Isaiah writes: <strong><em>“Turn away, turn away, get out of there, touch nothing unclean; get out from the midst of her, keep yourselves clean, you who are carrying the utensils of Jehovah.</em></strong> <strong><em>For you people will get out in no panic, and you will go in no flight. For Jehovah will be going even before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:12" data-bid="43-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 52:11,</em></strong> <strong><em>12</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> The departing Israelites must leave behind them in Babylon anything having a taint of Babylon’s false worship. Since they carry the utensils of Jehovah that came from the temple in Jerusalem, they have to be clean, not merely in an outward, ceremonial way, but primarily in their hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:11-12:24:13" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:7-15:1:7" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:7</a>) Further, Jehovah is going before them, so they do not have to panic, nor do they have to run frantically, as though bloodthirsty pursuers were hard on their heels. The God of Israel is their rear guard.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:21-15:8:23" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ezra 8:21-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">22. How does Paul stress the need for cleanness among anointed Christians?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span id="page192" class="pageNum" data-no="192" data-before-text="192"></span><sup>22 </sup>Isaiah’s words about keeping clean have a major fulfillment on the offspring of “Jerusalem above.” When Paul admonished the Corinthian Christians not to become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, he quoted the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:11-23:52:11" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:11</a>: “‘Therefore get out from among <span id="page193" class="pageNum" data-no="193" data-before-text="193"></span>them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:17" data-bid="47-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>) Just like the Israelites heading home from Babylon, Christians have to steer clear of Babylonish false worship.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">23. In what ways do servants of Jehovah today endeavor to keep themselves clean?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>This was particularly true of those anointed followers of Jesus Christ who fled Babylon the Great in 1919. They progressively cleansed themselves of all traces of false worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:19-23:8:20" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Romans 15:4</a>) They also became increasingly aware of the importance of moral cleanness. Although Jehovah’s Witnesses have always upheld high moral standards, <em>The Watchtower </em>carried articles in 1952 emphasizing the need to discipline immoral ones so as to keep the congregation clean. Such disciplinary action also helps the wrongdoer himself to realize the need for sincere repentance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:6-46:5:7" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:9-46:5:13" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 9-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:8-47:7:10" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 7:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:10-63:1:11" data-bid="49-4" class="b"> 2 John 10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">24. (a) In modern times, what are “the utensils of Jehovah”? (b) Why are Christians today confident that Jehovah will continue to go before them as well as be their rear guard?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Anointed Christians together with the great crowd of other sheep are determined to touch nothing that is spiritually unclean. Their purified, cleansed condition qualifies them to be bearers of “the utensils of Jehovah”​—the precious provisions that God makes for sacred service in the house-to-house and Bible study ministry and other forms of Christian activity. By maintaining a clean standing, God’s people today can be confident that Jehovah will continue to go before them as well as be their rear guard. As God’s clean people, they have an abundance of reasons to “cry out joyfully in unison”!</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">SEVENTY years​—a normal human life span—​that is how long the nation of Judah will be captive in Babylon.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. (a) To whom does Jehovah, through Isaiah, address his message of comfort? (b) How do faithful Jews ‘pursue after righteousness’?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To those in Judah who incline their hearts toward him, Jehovah says: <strong><em>“Listen to me, you people who are pursuing after righteousness, you who are seeking to find Jehovah.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:1-23:51:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 51:1a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>“Pursuing after righteousness” implies action. Those ‘pursuing righteousness’ will <span id="page166" class="pageNum" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>not merely claim to be God’s people. They will zealously strive to be righteous and to live in harmony with God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:15-19:34:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 34:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:21-20:21:21" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Proverbs 21:21</a>) They will look to Jehovah as the only Source of righteousness, and they will ‘seek to find Jehovah.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:7-19:11:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 11:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:17-19:145:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 145:17</a>) It is not that they will not already know who Jehovah is or how to approach him in prayer. Rather, they will endeavor to draw closer to him, worshiping him, praying to him, and seeking his direction in all they do.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">3, 4. (a) Who is “the rock” from which the Jews were hewn, and who is “the hollow of the pit” from which they were dug out? (b) Why will remembering their roots bring comfort to the Jews?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>However, those who truly pursue righteousness are comparatively few in Judah, and this may cause them to be fainthearted and despondent. So using the illustration of a quarry, Jehovah encourages them: <strong><em>“Look to the rock from which you were hewn out, and to the hollow of the pit from which you were dug out.</em></strong> <strong><em>Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gradually brought you forth with childbirth pains. For he was one when I called him, and I proceeded to bless him and to make him many.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:1-23:51:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 51:1b,</em></strong> <strong><em>2</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>“The rock” from which the Jews were hewn is Abraham, a historical figure in whom the nation of Israel takes much pride. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:9-40:3:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:33-43:8:33" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 8:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:39-43:8:39" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 39</a>) He is the progenitor, the human source, of the nation. “The hollow of the pit” is Sarah, from whose womb came Israel’s ancestor Isaac.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Abraham and Sarah were beyond their procreative years and were childless. Yet, Jehovah promised to bless Abraham and “to make him many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:15-1:17:17" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>) By divine restoration of their procreative powers, Abraham and Sarah brought forth a child in their old <span id="page167" class="pageNum" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>age, and from him God’s covenant nation sprang. Thus Jehovah made that one man father of a great nation whose number turned out to be as uncountable as the stars in the heavens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:5-1:15:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 15:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:5-44:7:5" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 7:5</a>) If Jehovah could thus take Abraham from a distant land and form him into a mighty nation, he can certainly carry out his promise to free a faithful remnant from bondage in Babylon, restore them to their homeland, and once again form them into a great nation. God’s promise to Abraham was fulfilled; his promise to those captive Jews will also be carried out.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5. (a) Whom do Abraham and Sarah picture? Explain. (b) In the final fulfillment, who trace their origin to “the rock”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The symbolic quarrying of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:1-23:51:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:1, 2</a> likely has a further application. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:18-5:32:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:18</a> calls Jehovah <span id="page168" class="pageNum" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>“the Rock” who fathered Israel and “the One bringing [Israel] forth with childbirth pains.” In the latter expression, the same Hebrew verb is used as that which appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:2-23:51:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:2</a> with regard to Sarah giving birth to Israel. Hence, Abraham stands as a prophetic type of Jehovah, the Greater Abraham. Abraham’s wife, Sarah, well pictures Jehovah’s universal heavenly organization of spirit creatures, represented in the Holy Scriptures as God’s wife, or woman. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:5-66:12:5" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 5</a>) In the final fulfillment of these words of Isaiah’s prophecy, the nation that springs from “the rock” is “the Israel of God,” the congregation of spirit-anointed Christians, which was born at Pentecost 33 C.E. As discussed in previous chapters of this book, that nation underwent Babylonish captivity in 1918 but was restored in 1919 to a state of spiritual prosperity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:26-48:3:29" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Galatians 3:26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:28-48:4:28" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 4:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 6:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah’s comfort for Zion, or Jerusalem, includes more than just a promise to produce a populous nation. We read: <strong><em>“Jehovah will certainly comfort Zion. He will for certain comfort all her devastated places, and he will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert plain like the garden of Jehovah. Exultation and rejoicing themselves will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:3-23:51:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 51:3</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>During the 70 years of desolation, the land of Judah will revert to a wilderness, overrun with thornbushes, brambles, and other wild vegetation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:10-23:64:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:26-24:4:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 4:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:10-24:9:12" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 9:10-12</a>) So in addition to the resettling of Judah, the restoration will have to include the restoring of the land, which will be converted into an Edenic garden with well-watered productive <span id="page169" class="pageNum" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>fields and fruitful orchards. The ground will appear to rejoice. Compared with its desolate condition during the exile, the land will be paradisaic. The anointed remnant of the Israel of God entered just such a paradise in a spiritual sense in 1919.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:7" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 35:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Calling for renewed attentiveness, Jehovah says: <strong><em>“Pay attention to me, O my people; and you national group of mine, to me give ear. For from me a law itself will go forth, and my judicial decision I shall cause to repose even as a light to the peoples.</em></strong> <strong><em>My righteousness is near.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah’s call to give ear to him means more than just hearing his message.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>All of this is to be true with regard not only to God’s covenant people but also to rightly disposed people everywhere, even on the most distant isles of the sea. Their confidence in God and in his ability to act in behalf of <span id="page170" class="pageNum" data-no="170" data-before-text="170"></span>his faithful servants and to save them will not be disappointed. His might, or power, represented by his arm, is sure; it cannot be stayed by anyone.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. (a) What truth will King Nebuchadnezzar be forced to learn? (b) What “heavens” and “earth” will be brought to an end?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Jehovah next refers to a truth that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will have to learn. Nothing in heaven or on earth can stop Jehovah from carrying out his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:34-27:4:35" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Daniel 4:34, 35</a>) We read: <strong><em>“Raise your eyes to the heavens themselves, and look at the earth beneath. For the very heavens must be dispersed in fragments just like smoke, and like a garment the earth itself will wear out, and its inhabitants themselves will die like a mere gnat.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:16-23:14:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:16, 17</a>) The Babylonian “heavens,” or ruling powers, will be broken in defeat. The Babylonian “earth,” the subjects of those ruling <span id="page171" class="pageNum" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>powers, will gradually come to an end. Yes, even the greatest power of the day cannot stand against Jehovah’s might or prevent his acts of salvation.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. Why is the complete fulfillment of the prophecy that the Babylonian “heavens” and “earth” would be brought to an end encouraging to Christians today?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>How encouraging it is for Christians today to know that these prophetic words were completely fulfilled! Why? Because the apostle Peter used similar expressions regarding a yet future event. He spoke of the rapidly approaching day of Jehovah, “through which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements being intensely hot will melt!” Then he said: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:12-61:3:13" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:4-23:34:4" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Isaiah 34:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:12-66:6:14" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Revelation 6:12-14</a>) Although the mighty nations and their lofty starlike rulers may stand in defiance of Jehovah, in his due time they will be brought to nothing​—crushed as easily as a mere gnat.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>The historical examples of which Isaiah speaks are well chosen. Every Israelite knows of the nation’s deliverance from Egypt and passage through the Red Sea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:24-2:12:27" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Exodus 12:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:26-2:14:31" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 14:26-31</a>) The expressions “Rahab” and “the sea monster” refer to Egypt under her Pharaoh who opposed Israel’s Exodus from Egypt.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15. (a) When and how will the grief and sighing of Zion flee away? (b) When did grief and sighing flee away for the Israel of God in modern times?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Now looking ahead to Israel’s deliverance from Babylon, the prophecy continues: <strong><em>“Then the redeemed ones of Jehovah themselves will return and must come to Zion with a joyful outcry, and rejoicing to time indefinite will be upon their head.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>What will be the price of the redemption of the Jews?

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Jehovah further reassures his people: <strong><em>“I​—I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man that will die, and of a son of mankind that will be rendered as mere green grass?</em></strong> <strong><em>And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth, so that you were in dread constantly the whole day long on account of the rage of the one hemming you in, as though he was all set to bring you to ruin?

Still, there is no reason to fear the rage of Babylon. Although that nation, the third world power of Bible record, will conquer God’s people and seek to ‘hem them in,’ or block their way of escape, faithful Jews know that Jehovah has foretold the fall of Babylon at the hand of Cyrus.

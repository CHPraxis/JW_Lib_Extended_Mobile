<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">FOR nearly two thousand years, Christians have been “awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:12-61:3:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:13-56:2:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Titus 2:13</a>) It is understandable that they are anxious for that day to come. After all, it will mark the beginning of their relief from the ravages of imperfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:22-45:8:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 8:22</a>) It will also mean an end to the pressures they suffer during these “critical times hard to deal with.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>However, while Jehovah’s day will bring relief for righteous ones, it will also mean destruction for “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:7-53:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8</a>) This is sobering to contemplate. Will God really bring about the destruction of the wicked simply to rescue his people from distressing conditions? The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:1-23:63:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">63rd chapter of Isaiah</a> shows that there is a far loftier issue involved, namely, the sanctification of God’s name.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">3, 4. (a) What is the setting for the prophecy in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:1-23:63:19" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 63</a>? (b) Who does Isaiah see marching toward Jerusalem, and whom have some scholars identified that one to be?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:1-23:62:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 62</a>, we read of the liberation of the <span id="page350" class="pageNum" data-no="350" data-before-text="350"></span>Jews from captivity in Babylon and their restoration to their homeland. Naturally, the question arises: Will the restored remnant of Jews need to fear further devastation from other enemy nations? Isaiah’s vision does much to allay their fear. The prophecy begins: <strong><em>“Who is this one coming from Edom, the one with garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, this one who is honorable in his clothing, marching in the abundance of his power?”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:1-23:63:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 63:1a</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Isaiah sees a warrior, energetic and triumphant, marching toward Jerusalem. His magnificent clothing indicates that he is of the very highest rank. He comes from the direction of Edom’s most prominent city, Bozrah, suggesting that he has won a great victory over that enemy land. Who can this warrior be? Some scholars identify him with Jesus Christ. Others believe him to be the Jewish military leader Judas Maccabaeus. However, the warrior himself indicates his own identity when he answers the foregoing question by saying: <strong><em>“I, the One speaking in righteousness, the One abounding in power to save.”​—</em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:1-23:63:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 63:1b</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>There is little question that this warrior is Jehovah God himself. Elsewhere, he is described as having an “abundance of dynamic energy” and as “speaking what is righteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:19-23:45:19" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 45:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:23-23:45:23" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 23</a>) The warrior’s magnificent garments remind us of the psalmist’s words: “O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great.

The Edomites, perpetuators of an animosity that began with their forefather, Esau, are age-old enemies of God’s covenant people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:7-19:137:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 137:7</a>) Jehovah takes such animosity as an offense against him personally. No wonder that he determined to unleash his sword of vengeance against Edom!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:5-23:34:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 34:5-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:7-24:49:22" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7. (a) How was the prophecy against Edom initially fulfilled? (b) What does Edom symbolize?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Isaiah’s vision is therefore of much encouragement to the Jews returning to Jerusalem. It assures them of safe dwelling in their new home. Indeed, by the days of the prophet Malachi, God made Edom’s “mountains a desolated waste and his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:3-39:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Malachi 1:3</a>) Does this mean, then, that Isaiah’s prophecy was completely fulfilled by Malachi’s day? No, for in spite of its desolate condition, Edom was determined to rebuild its devastated places, and Malachi continued to call Edom “the territory of wickedness” and “the people whom Jehovah has denounced to time indefinite.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:4-39:1:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Malachi 1:4, 5</a>) Prophetically, however, Edom encompasses more than the descendants of Esau. It serves as a symbol of <em>all </em>the nations that prove themselves to be enemies of Jehovah’s worshipers. The nations of Christendom have been particularly prominent in this regard. What will happen to this modern-day Edom?</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>These graphic words describe a bloodbath. Why, even God’s elegant garments are stained, like the garments of one treading a winepress! A winepress is a fitting symbol of the trapped condition in which enemies of Jehovah God find themselves when he moves to destroy them. When will this symbolic winepress be trodden? The prophecies of Joel and of the apostle John also speak of a symbolic winepress. The winepress of those prophecies is to be trodden when Jehovah treads down his enemies to destruction at Armageddon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:13-29:3:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joel 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:18-66:14:20" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Revelation 14:18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 16:16</a>) The prophetic winepress of Isaiah points forward to the same time.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Why, though, does Jehovah say that he trod this winepress by himself, while there was no man with him from the peoples? Will not Jesus Christ, as God’s representive, take the lead in treading the winepress? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-16</a>) Yes, but Jehovah is referring to humans, not spirit creatures.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) Isaiah’s prophecy thus assures Christians today that at God’s appointed time, He will intervene in their behalf.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12, 13. (a) In what way is there no helper for Jehovah? (b) How does Jehovah’s arm furnish salvation, and how does his rage support him?</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>In times past, the Jews quickly lost appreciation for the things Jehovah did in their behalf. Appropriately, then, Isaiah reminds them of <em>why </em>Jehovah did such things. Isaiah declares: <strong><em>“The loving-kindnesses of Jehovah I shall mention, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has rendered to us, even the abundant goodness to the house of Israel that he has rendered to them according to his mercies and according to the abundance of his loving-kindnesses.</em></strong> <strong><em>And he went on to say: ‘Surely they are my people, sons that will not prove false.’ So it was to them that he came to be a Savior.</em></strong> <strong><em>During all their distress it was distressing to him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>) Jehovah stuck to that promise, showing abundant goodness to the house of Israel.

No, for Isaiah reveals that Jehovah said to himself: “Surely they are my people, sons that will not prove false.” One scholar observes: “The ‘surely’ is not the fiat of sovereignty or foreknowledge: it is the hope and confidence of love.” Yes, Jehovah made his covenant in good faith, sincerely wanting his people to succeed. In spite of their obvious shortcomings, he displayed confidence in them. How wonderful it is to worship a God who places such trust in his worshipers!

On the contrary, Isaiah relates that “during all their distress it was distressing to him.” What empathy Jehovah has! As with any loving father, it pained God to see his children suffer, even when the suffering was due to their own foolishness. As foretold and in evidence of his love, he sent his “personal messenger,” likely Jesus in his prehuman existence, to lead them into the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:20-2:23:20" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Exodus 23:20</a>) Thus Jehovah lifted the nation up and carried it, “just as a man carries his son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:31-5:1:31" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:10-19:106:10" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Psalm 106:10</a>) Today we can be confident that Jehovah is equally aware of our sufferings and that he feels for us when we are in dire straits.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Yes, suffering the results of disobedience, the Jews long for the days when Jehovah was their Deliverer instead of their enemy. They recall how their “shepherds,” Moses and Aaron, led them safely through the Red Sea. <span id="page358" class="pageNum" data-no="358" data-before-text="358"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:77:20-19:77:20" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 77:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:10-23:51:10" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Isaiah 51:10</a>) They recall a time when instead of hurting God’s spirit, they were led by it through the guidance given by Moses and other spirit-appointed older men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:16-4:11:17" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Numbers 11:16, 17</a>) They also remember seeing Jehovah’s “beautiful arm” of strength being used in their behalf through Moses! In time, God took them out of the great and fear-inspiring wilderness and led them into a land flowing with milk and honey​—a place of rest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:19-5:1:19" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:6-6:5:6" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Joshua 5:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:22:4-6:22:4" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> 22:4</a>) Now, though, the Israelites suffer because of having lost their favorable relationship with God!</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Still, the material loss of the Israelites pales in comparison with the loss of the privilege they have tossed away, namely, that of sharing in the glorifying of God’s name. Moses promised the Jews: “Jehovah will establish you as a holy people to himself, just as he swore to you, because you continue to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and you have walked in his ways. And all the peoples of the earth will have to see that Jehovah’s name has been called upon you, and they will indeed be afraid of you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:9-5:28:10" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:9, 10</a>) When Jehovah acted in defense of Abraham’s descendants, rescuing them from slavery in Egypt, he was not doing so simply to make life more convenient or pleasant for them. He was acting in behalf of something far more important​—his name. Yes, he was seeing to it that his name was “declared in all the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:15-2:9:16" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Exodus 9:15, 16</a>) And when God showed mercy after the rebellion of <span id="page359" class="pageNum" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>Israel in the wilderness, his reason for doing so was not mere sentiment. Jehovah himself said: “I went acting for the sake of my own name that it might not be profaned before the eyes of the nations.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:8-26:20:10" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ezekiel 20:8-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>What a powerful conclusion Isaiah then gives to this prophecy! He says: <strong><em>“Thus you led your people in order to make a beautiful name for your own self.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:14-23:63:14" data-bid="54-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 63:14b</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Now it can be clearly seen why Jehovah fights mightily in the interests of his people. It is to make a beautiful name for himself. Isaiah’s prophecy thus serves as a powerful reminder that bearing the name of Jehovah is both an awesome privilege and a great responsibility. True Christians today love the name of Jehovah more than their own lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:56:6-23:56:6" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Isaiah 56:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:10</a>) They are loath to do anything that could possibly bring reproach upon that sacred name. They respond to God’s loyal love by remaining loyal to him. And because they love Jehovah’s beautiful name, they long for the day when he will trample his enemies in the winepress of his anger​—not merely because it will benefit them but because it will lead to the glorification of the name of the God they love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">“RELIGION Makes a Comeback.” That was the message proclaimed by an article in <em>The New York Times Magazine. </em>The article indicated that religion still seems to have a tenacious grip on the hearts and minds of millions of people. It may therefore be difficult to believe that a radical change in the world’s religious climate is about to take place. But such a change is indicated in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:1-23:47:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the 47th chapter of Isaiah</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Isaiah’s words were fulfilled 2,500 years ago. However, the words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:8-23:47:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:8</a> are quoted in the book of Revelation and given a future application.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:19-66:16:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 16:19</a>) The designation “Babylon” for the false religions of the world is appropriate, since it was in ancient Babylon that false religion got its start.

Sit down on the earth where there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will not experience again that people call you delicate and dainty.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:1-23:47:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:1</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>For years Babylon has been enthroned as the dominating world power. She has been “the decoration of kingdoms”​—a thriving religious, commercial, and military center. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:19-23:13:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 13:19</a>) At Babylon’s peak her empire extends as far south as the border of Egypt. And when she defeats Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., it seems that God himself is unable to halt her conquests! Thus, she sees herself as a “virgin daughter,” one who will never suffer a foreign invasion.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 4. What will Babylon experience?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>However, this haughty “virgin” is to be knocked off her throne as the undisputed world power and made to ‘sit in the dust’ in humiliation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:5-23:26:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:5</a>) She will no longer be considered “delicate and dainty,” like a pampered queen. Jehovah thus commands: <strong><em>“Take a hand mill and grind out flour. Uncover your veil. Strip off the flowing skirt. Uncover the leg. Cross over the rivers.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:2-23:47:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:2</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>After having enslaved the entire nation of Judah, <span id="page107" class="pageNum" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>Babylon will now be treated as a slave herself! The Medes and the Persians, who unseat her from her position of power, will force her to do humiliating labor in their behalf.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 5. (a) How will Babylon be stripped of her ‘veil and flowing skirt’? (b) What may be indicated by the command for her to “cross over the rivers”?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Babylon will thus be stripped of her ‘veil and flowing skirt,’ losing every vestige of her former greatness and dignity. “Cross over the rivers,” her taskmasters will command. Perhaps some Babylonians will actually be ordered to perform slavish outdoor labor. Or the prophecy may mean that some will literally be dragged across rivers as they are taken into exile. In any event, Babylon will no longer travel in the grand style of a queen who is transported across a stream in a chair or by carriage. Instead, she will be like a slave who has to forsake modesty, raising her skirt and exposing her legs in order to wade across a river. How humiliating!</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 6. (a) In what sense will Babylon’s nakedness be uncovered? (b) How does God “not meet any man kindly”? (See footnote.)</p>

They will cry out: <strong><em>“There is One repurchasing us.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:47-3:25:54" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Leviticus 25:47-54</a>) Since the Jews will have been sold into slavery to Babylon, they will need to be repurchased, or set free. For slaves, conquest normally means little more than a change of masters. But Jehovah will move conquering King Cyrus to release the Jews from slavery. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba will be given to Cyrus as “a ransom” in place of the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:3-23:43:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:3</a>) Appropriately, Israel’s Redeemer is called “Jehovah of armies.” Babylon’s seemingly powerful military force is puny when compared with Jehovah’s invisible, angelic hosts.</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 8. In what sense will Babylon “come into the darkness”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah resumes his prophetic denunciation of Babylon: <strong><em>“Sit down silently and come into the darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you will not experience again that people call you Mistress of Kingdoms.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:5-23:47:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:5</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>There will be nothing but darkness and gloom for Babylon.

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 9. Why does Jehovah become indignant at the Jews?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Why is Babylon allowed to harm God’s people in the first place? Jehovah explains: <strong><em>“I grew indignant at my </em></strong><span id="page109" class="pageNum" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span><strong><em>people. I profaned my inheritance, and I proceeded to give them into your hand.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:6-23:47:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:6a</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Jehovah has good reason to be indignant at the Jews. Formerly, he warned them that disobedience to his Law would result in their expulsion from the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:64-5:28:64" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>) When they fell into idolatry and sexual immorality, Jehovah lovingly sent prophets to help restore them to pure worship. But “they were continually making jest at the messengers of the true God and despising his words and mocking at his prophets, until the rage of Jehovah came up against his people, until there was no healing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:16-14:36:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>) God therefore allows his inheritance, Judah, to be profaned when Babylon invades the land and defiles His holy temple.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:1-19:79:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 79:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:21-26:24:21" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 24:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">10, 11. Why is Jehovah angry at Babylon, even though it is his will that she conquer his people?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In view of that, is not Babylon simply performing God’s will when she enslaves the Jews? No, for God says: <strong><em>“You showed them no mercies. Upon the old man you made your yoke very heavy.</em></strong> <strong><em>And you kept saying: ‘To time indefinite I shall prove to be Mistress, forever.’ You did not take these things to your heart; you did not remember the finale of the matter.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:6-23:47:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:6b,</em></strong> <strong><em>7</em></strong></a><strong>)</strong> God has not commanded Babylon to act with excessive cruelty, showing no favor “even to the old men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:4:16-25:4:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Lamentations 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:5:12-25:5:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>) Neither has he urged them to take sadistic pleasure in mocking their Jewish captives.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:3-19:137:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 137:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Babylon fails to grasp that her hold on the Jews is temporary. She has ignored the warnings of Isaiah that, in time, Jehovah will free his people. She behaves as if she were entitled to have permanent dominion over the Jews and to remain mistress over her vassal nations <span id="page110" class="pageNum" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>forever. She fails to heed the message that there will be a “finale” to her oppressive rule!</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Babylon’s Fall Foretold</strong></p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">12. Why is Babylon called a “pleasure-given woman”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jehovah declares: <strong><em>“Now hear this, you pleasure-given woman, the one sitting in security, the one saying in her heart: ‘I am, and there is nobody else. I shall not sit as a widow, and I shall not know the loss of children.’” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:8-23:47:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:8</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Babylon’s reputation for pleasure-seeking is well-known. Fifth century B.C.E. historian Herodotus tells of a “most shameful custom” of the Babylonians, namely, that all women are required to prostitute themselves in homage to their goddess of love. Ancient historian Curtius likewise said: “No contamination can surpass the manners of the city; no systematic corruption can offer more stimulations and allurements to debauchery.”</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">13. How will Babylon’s penchant for pleasure-seeking hasten her fall?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Babylon’s penchant for pleasure-seeking will hasten her fall. On the eve of her fall, her king and his grandees will feast, drinking themselves into a stupor. Thus, they will pay no heed to the Medo-Persian armies invading the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:1-27:5:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 5:1-4</a>) “Sitting in security,” Babylon will imagine that her seemingly impregnable walls and moat will protect her from invasion. She tells herself that “there is nobody else” who could ever occupy her place of supremacy. She does not imagine that she could become “a widow,” losing her imperial ruler as well as her “children,” or populace. Still, no wall can protect her from the avenging arm of Jehovah God! Jehovah will later say: “Even if Babylon should ascend to the <span id="page112" class="pageNum" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>heavens and even if she should make the height of her strength unapproachable, from me the despoilers will come to her.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:53-24:51:53" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:53</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">14. In what ways will Babylon suffer both “loss of children and widowhood”?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>What will result to Babylon? Jehovah continues: <strong><em>“But to you these two things will come suddenly, in one day: loss of children and widowhood. In their complete measure they must come upon you, for the abundance of your sorceries, for the full might of your spells​—exceedingly.” </em>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:9-23:47:9" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 47:9</em></strong></a><strong>) </strong>Yes, Babylon’s supremacy as a world power will suddenly come to an end. In the ancient Eastern lands, becoming a widow and losing children were the most calamitous experiences that a woman could undergo. We do not know how many “children” Babylon loses on the night of her fall.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> In due time, though, that city will be abandoned entirely. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:29-24:51:29" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:29</a>) She will also suffer widowhood in that her kings will be dethroned.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">15. In addition to Babylon’s cruelty to the Jews, for what further reason is Jehovah wrathful with her?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Babylon’s mistreatment of the Jews, however, is not the only reason for Jehovah’s rage. ‘The abundance of her sorceries’ also incites him to anger. God’s Law to Israel condemns the practice of spiritism; Babylon, though, avidly pursues the occult. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:21-26:21:21" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 21:21</a>) The book <em>Social Life Among the Assyrians and Babylonians </em>says that the Babylonians’ lives “were passed in perpetual fear of the multitudinous demons by which they believed themselves to be surrounded.”</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Will Babylon’s fortune-tellers save her? Jehovah answers: <strong><em>“You kept trusting in your badness.

She feels that no one can ‘see’ her, that is, hold her accountable for her wicked actions. Nor does she perceive a rival on the horizon. “I am, and there is nobody else,” she tells herself.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>However, through another of his prophets, Jehovah warns: “Can any man be concealed in places of concealment and I myself not see him?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:24-24:23:24" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Hebrews 4:13</a>) Jehovah therefore declares: <strong><em>“Upon you calamity must come; you will know no charming against it.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>In the year 539 B.C.E., these inspired words start to be fulfilled.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span id="page117" class="pageNum" data-no="117" data-before-text="117"></span><sup>23 </sup>These prophetic words also help us to have confidence in Jehovah, who is more powerful than all his opposers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:8-19:24:8" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 24:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:7-19:34:7" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 34:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:15-19:50:15" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 50:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:14-19:91:15" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 91:14, 15</a>) This is a comforting reminder in these difficult days. Confidence in Jehovah strengthens our determination to remain blameless in his eyes, knowing that “the future of [the blameless] man will be peaceful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:37-19:37:38" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 37:37, 38</a>) It is always wise to look to Jehovah and not rely on our own resources in the face of Satan’s “crafty acts.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:13" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">24, 25. (a) Why is astrology illogical, yet why do many turn to it? (b) What are some reasons why Christians shun superstition?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Notably, we are warned against spiritistic practices, especially astrology. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:20-48:5:21" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Galatians 5:20, 21</a>) When Babylon fell, astrology did not lose its hold on people. Interestingly, the book <em>Great Cities of the Ancient World </em>notes that the constellations mapped out by the Babylonians have “shifted” from their ancient positions, “making nonsense of the whole idea [of astrology].” Still, astrology continues to thrive, and many newspapers carry columns that make horoscopes readily available to their readers.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>What makes people​—many of them well educated—​consult the stars or engage in other illogical, superstitious practices? <em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>says: “Superstitions will probably have a part in life as long as people fear each other and have uncertainties about the future.” Fear and uncertainty may drive people to become superstitious. Christians, however, shun superstition. They do not fear man​—Jehovah is their support. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:4-19:6:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Psalm 6:4-10</a>) And they are not uncertain about the future; they know Jehovah’s revealed purposes and have no <span id="page118" class="pageNum" data-no="118" data-before-text="118"></span>doubt that “to time indefinite the very counsel of Jehovah will stand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:11-19:33:11" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 33:11</a>) Bringing our lives into harmony with Jehovah’s counsel ensures a happy, long-term future.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">26. How have “the reasonings of the wise men” proved to be “futile”?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>In recent years some have tried to discern the future in more “scientific” ways. There is even a discipline called futurology, defined as “a study that deals with future possibilities based on current trends.” For example, back in 1972 a group of academics and businessmen known as the Club of Rome predicted that by 1992 all the world’s reserves of gold, mercury, zinc, and petroleum would be exhausted. Well, the world has faced horrendous problems since 1972, but that prediction was wrong on all counts. The earth still has reserves of gold, mercury, zinc, and petroleum. Indeed, man has worn himself out trying to predict the future, but his guesses are always unreliable. Truly, “the reasonings of the wise men are futile”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:20-46:3:20" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">27. When and in what way did Babylon the Great undergo a fall like that of Babylon in 539 B.C.E.?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Modern-day religions have perpetuated many of ancient Babylon’s doctrines. Hence, the world empire of false religion is well named Babylon the Great. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5</a>) That international religious conglomerate has already suffered a fall similar to that of ancient Babylon in 539 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:8-66:14:8" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Revelation 14:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 18:2</a>) In 1919 the remnant of Christ’s brothers came out of spiritual captivity and shook off the religious influence of Christendom, a dominant part of Babylon the Great. Since then Christendom <span id="page119" class="pageNum" data-no="119" data-before-text="119"></span>has lost considerable influence in many lands where it was formerly strong.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">28. What boast does Babylon the Great make, but what awaits her?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>That fall, however, was just a precursor to the ultimate destruction of false religion. Interestingly, Revelation’s prophecy of the destruction of Babylon the Great reminds us of the prophetic words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:8-23:47:9" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:8, 9</a>. Like ancient Babylon, modern-day Babylon the Great says: “I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.” But “in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.” So the prophetic words recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:47:1-23:47:15" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 47</a> stand as a warning to those who are still affiliated with false religion. If they are to avoid sharing in her destruction, let them heed the inspired command: “Get out of her”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:7-66:18:8" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 7, 8</a>.</p>

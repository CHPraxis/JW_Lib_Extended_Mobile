The Joys of Watching Birds
HOW different the world would be without birds! Their chirping, their songs, their varied colors and flight—all contribute to the beautiful variety of life. But how often do we stop to listen to and observe them? If you are a city dweller surrounded by the hustle and bustle of daily life and the noise of traffic, you may not even notice the birds in your neighborhood. Even if you live in the country, it is easy to take them for granted. But would you like to see your local birds close up?
You can do just that by means of a simple bird feeder in your backyard, placed within range of a window. Then, all you need is a pair of binoculars and a camera with a good zoom lens—and a little patience! Have plenty of high-speed film at the ready and a good illustrated bird guidebook for identification. Then watch, listen, and enjoy!

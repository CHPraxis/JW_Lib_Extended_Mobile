<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR in Spain wrote to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in his country to express appreciation for <em>Awake! </em>He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Two copies of your journal <em>Awake! </em>recently came into my hands. I found that they contained very interesting articles on a variety of themes. I do not belong to any religious group, but I appreciated how objective the publication is. It also has a magnificent presentation, and it deals with subjects from an impartial and scientific perspective. I congratulate you for the effort you make.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In many of its articles, <em>Awake! </em>marshals an array of evidence from various sciences that helps its readers to draw informed conclusions. Such an approach is also taken in the 32-page brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>For example, under the subheadings “Did Life Originate by Chance?” and “Design Requires a Designer,” evidence bearing on the matter is presented by recognized authorities in the fields of astronomy, microbiology, and physics.</p>

Impressed by Their Objectivity
A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR in Spain wrote to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in his country to express appreciation for Awake! He explained:
“Two copies of your journal Awake! recently came into my hands. I found that they contained very interesting articles on a variety of themes. I do not belong to any religious group, but I appreciated how objective the publication is. It also has a magnificent presentation, and it deals with subjects from an impartial and scientific perspective. I congratulate you for the effort you make.”
In many of its articles, Awake! marshals an array of evidence from various sciences that helps its readers to draw informed conclusions. Such an approach is also taken in the 32-page brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? For example, under the subheadings “Did Life Originate by Chance?” and “Design Requires a Designer,” evidence bearing on the matter is presented by recognized authorities in the fields of astronomy, microbiology, and physics.

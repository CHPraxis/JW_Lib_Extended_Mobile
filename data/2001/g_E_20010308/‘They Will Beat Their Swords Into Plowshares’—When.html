<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A FAMOUS statue at the United Nations in New York City depicts a man beating a sword into a plowshare. It is based on the Bible prophecies of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 2, verse 4</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:4:3-33:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Micah chapter 4, verse 3</a>. How and when will these words be fulfilled?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A recent report in <em>The New York Times </em>carried the headline “Global Arms Sales Swell to $30 Billion”! In 1999 who were the leading suppliers of this vast array of arms? The United States led the way with sales of $11.8 billion. Second was Russia with less than half that amount. However, Russia nearly doubled its sales over the previous year. Then came Germany, China, France, Britain, and Italy. The same report continued: “As in the past, roughly two-thirds of all arms were sold to developing nations.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After two world wars and many other major wars during the 20th century, which left hundreds of millions dead and wounded, one is led to ask, “When will the nations ever learn peace instead of war?” The Bible indicates that this turning to peace would be “in the final part of the days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2</a>) In fact, this prophecy is already undergoing fulfillment, as nearly six million Jehovah’s Witnesses have allowed themselves ‘to be taught by Jehovah.’ As a consequence, their ‘peace is abundant.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Soon Jehovah will bring an end to all weapons and wars and those who promote them, for he will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” If you would like to know more about this wonderful change, please feel free to contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the appropriate address listed on page 5.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>.</p>

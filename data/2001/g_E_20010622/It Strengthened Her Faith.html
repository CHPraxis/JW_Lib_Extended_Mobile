<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in New York State, wrote regarding the 32-page brochure entitled <em>Will There Ever Be a World Without War?: </em>“I felt compelled to write to let you know how much I appreciated and enjoyed it. Although I am not Jewish and was raised by a mother who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I was never more moved by a piece of literature in my life!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I hesitated to read it at first because I felt that since it considered subjects of special interest to the Jews, I would have a hard time getting through it. I was wrong. Everything was presented in such a clear and logical way.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Certain peoples in history have certainly experienced intense suffering. That has been true of the Jews, especially during the Holocaust of the last century. We invite you to read <em>Will There Ever Be a World Without War? </em>It considers such topics as “Why Does God Permit Wickedness?” “Knowing the True God—What Does It Mean?” and “Who Will Lead the Nations to Peace?”</p>

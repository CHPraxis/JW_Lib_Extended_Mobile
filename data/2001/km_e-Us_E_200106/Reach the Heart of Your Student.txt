Reach the Heart of Your Student
1 Before ascending to heaven, Jesus told his disciples to teach others to “observe” all the things he had commanded. (Matt. 28:19, 20) If a person is going to “observe” Christ’s commands, the information has to reach his heart. (Ps. 119:112) How can you touch the heart of someone with whom you are studying the Bible?
2 Pray for Jehovah’s Direction: Making disciples is God’s work. His blessing, not our abilities, is imperative for success. (Acts 16:14; 1 Cor. 3:7) Thus, praying for Jehovah’s help in teaching the truth to others is essential.​—Isa. 50:4.
3 Discern What the Student Believes: Knowing what people believe and why they believe it can give us insight as to what to say to reach their heart. Why does a student find a particular teaching appealing? What convinced him that it is believable? Such knowledge can help us to speak with discernment.​—Acts 17:22, 23.
4 Build a Logical, Scriptural Argument: The truth has to make sense to the student. (Acts 17:24-31) We have to give a sound reason for our hope. (1 Pet. 3:15) However, always do so in a kind, patient manner.
5 Reinforce It With Illustrations: Not only do illustrations make it easier for the student to understand but they also stir emotions. They engage both the mind and the heart. Jesus used them often. (Mark 4:33, 34) Of course, to be effective, the illustration used must fit the point being discussed, and it should relate to the life of the student.
6 Show the Benefits of Accepting the Truth: People want to know the benefits of applying what they are learning. Help your student to see the wisdom of Paul’s words at 2 Timothy 3:14-17.
7 Do not be discouraged if some do not respond to your teaching. Not all hearts are receptive. (Matt. 13:15) However, some individuals do become believers. (Acts 17:32-34) May your efforts to reach hearts with the good news aid many more to accept and “observe” what Jesus commanded.

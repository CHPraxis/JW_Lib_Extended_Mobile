<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Those words of a faithful Christian who survived the Holocaust echo the determination of the thousands of Witnesses​—living and dead—​who were resolute in their beliefs despite Nazi cruelty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:13-49:6:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Their thrilling story of courage and triumph is told in the heart-stirring video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault. </em>All in the congregation are urged to watch it and share their impressions and feelings with one another.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Let these questions stimulate your thinking: <strong>(1) </strong>For what reasons did Jehovah’s Witnesses take a bold stand against the Nazis? <strong>(2a) </strong>What battle lines were drawn over a greeting, and why? <strong>(2b) </strong>How did this affect Witness families? <strong>(3) </strong>How many Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, how were they identified there, and how did the Gestapo treat them? <strong>(4) </strong>What price were our brothers not willing to pay for freedom? <strong>(5a) </strong>How and when did Jehovah’s Witnesses speak out against the atrocities of Hitler’s regime? <strong>(5b) </strong>How did Hitler react? <strong>(6) </strong>How did the solidarity of Jehovah’s people prove to be lifesaving to them and to others, physically and spiritually? <strong>(7) </strong>What Kingdom song was written in a concentration camp? <strong>(8) </strong>What examples of faithful men, women, and youths inspire you to keep your integrity to Jehovah, come what may? (See also the <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:301999000/250:341-263"><em>1999 Yearbook, </em>pages 144-7</a>.) <strong>(9) </strong>As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, how does this video make you feel about being no part of the world?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The positive example of Jehovah’s Witnesses portrayed in the <em>Stand Firm </em>video can help young people, even those who are not Witnesses, to face such important issues as intolerance, peer pressure, and conscience. If you are a youth attending middle school or higher grades, can you give your teachers the opportunity to use this material in class? Perhaps you can offer them a copy of the video and describe it as a little-known piece of history or as a documentary with a moral lesson.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The <em>Stand Firm </em>video is an excellent tool to show how divine teaching gives us spiritual strength to please God by remaining firm for what is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:13-46:16:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 16:13</a>) Share it with all who have an interest in the truth.</p>

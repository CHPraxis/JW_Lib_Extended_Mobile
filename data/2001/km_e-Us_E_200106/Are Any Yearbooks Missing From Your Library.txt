Are Any Yearbooks Missing From Your Library?
Every Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a treasure trove of delightful reading. The upbuilding reports on the Kingdom-preaching work from around the world strengthen our confidence in Jehovah’s guidance, protection, and blessing. We have a supply of English editions of the Yearbook for the years 1986, 1987, and 1990 to 2000. They contain the exciting history of the Kingdom work in Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Britain, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Martinique, Mexico, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Paraguay, Poland, Puerto Rico, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Why not check to see if any of these editions of the Yearbook are missing from your personal library? The Theocratic Ministry School overseer should likewise check the Kingdom Hall library. Any publishers or congregations that desire these Yearbooks may now request them through the congregation literature servant.

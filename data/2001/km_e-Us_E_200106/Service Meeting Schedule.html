This is the first of three Service Meeting parts that will review Scriptural principles related to supplemental education. Some Christian youths are pursuing secular careers through higher education, which is having a negative impact on their spirituality. This part is a discussion between two parents and their teenage son or daughter. The youth is at a point where a serious decision needs to be made about future goals. Although some may want to pursue financial advantages, prestige, or comforts of life, the family examine the Bible to see what it recommends. (See <em>Young People Ask, </em>pages 174-5; <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1997605/18-24:201"><em>The Watchtower, </em>August 15, 1997, page 21, and</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1999644/3-6"> September 1, 1999, pages 19-21, paragraphs 1-3 and</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1999644/9-10"> 5-6</a>.)

15 min: Youths​—Be Wise in Choosing Your Career. This is the first of three Service Meeting parts that will review Scriptural principles related to supplemental education. Some Christian youths are pursuing secular careers through higher education, which is having a negative impact on their spirituality. This part is a discussion between two parents and their teenage son or daughter. The youth is at a point where a serious decision needs to be made about future goals. Although some may want to pursue financial advantages, prestige, or comforts of life, the family examine the Bible to see what it recommends. (See Young People Ask, pages 174-5; The Watchtower, August 15, 1997, page 21, and September 1, 1999, pages 19-21, paragraphs 1-3 and 5-6.) The youth agrees that it is wise to pursue a course in life that will serve him or her well in achieving theocratic goals to advance Kingdom interests.
17 min: “Be Alert to Finding Deaf People in Your Territory.”b If statistics are available, mention how many deaf people are located in your congregation territory.

Relate the experience in the February 1998 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 3, paragraph 7.

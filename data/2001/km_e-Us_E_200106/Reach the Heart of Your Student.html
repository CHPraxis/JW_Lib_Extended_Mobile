<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Before ascending to heaven, Jesus told his disciples to teach others to “observe” all the things he had commanded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) If a person is going to “observe” Christ’s commands, the information has to reach his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:112-19:119:112" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 119:112</a>) How can you touch the heart of someone with whom you are studying the Bible?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Pray for Jehovah’s Direction: </strong>Making disciples is God’s work. His blessing, not our abilities, is imperative for success. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:7-46:3:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:7</a>) Thus, praying for Jehovah’s help in teaching the truth to others is essential.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:4-23:50:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 50:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Discern What the Student Believes: </strong>Knowing what people believe and why they believe it can give us insight as to what to say to reach their heart. Why does a student find a particular teaching appealing? What convinced him that it is believable? Such knowledge can help us to speak with discernment.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:22-44:17:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 17:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Build a Logical, Scriptural Argument: </strong>The truth has to make sense to the student. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-31</a>) We have to give a sound reason for our hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) However, always do so in a kind, patient manner.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Reinforce It With Illustrations: </strong>Not only do illustrations make it easier for the student to understand but they also stir emotions. They engage both the mind and the heart. Jesus used them often. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:33-41:4:34" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 4:33, 34</a>) Of course, to be effective, the illustration used must fit the point being discussed, and it should relate to the life of the student.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Show the Benefits of Accepting the Truth: </strong>People want to know the benefits of applying what they are learning. Help your student to see the wisdom of Paul’s words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:14-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Do not be discouraged if some do not respond to your teaching. Not all hearts are receptive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:15-40:13:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 13:15</a>) However, some individuals do become believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:32-44:17:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 17:32-34</a>) May your efforts to reach hearts with the good news aid many more to accept and “observe” what Jesus commanded.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Every <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>is a treasure trove of delightful reading. The upbuilding reports on the Kingdom-preaching work from around the world strengthen our confidence in Jehovah’s guidance, protection, and blessing. We have a supply of <strong>English </strong>editions of the <em>Yearbook </em>for the years <strong>1986, 1987, </strong>and <strong>1990 to 2000. </strong>They contain the exciting history of the Kingdom work in Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Britain, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Martinique, Mexico, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Paraguay, Poland, Puerto Rico, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Why not check to see if any of these editions of the <em>Yearbook </em>are missing from your personal library? The Theocratic Ministry School overseer should likewise check the Kingdom Hall library. Any publishers or congregations that desire these <em>Yearbooks </em>may now request them through the congregation literature servant.</p>

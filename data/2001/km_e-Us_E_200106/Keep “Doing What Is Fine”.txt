Keep “Doing What Is Fine”
1 You did a fine thing when you became a servant of Jehovah God. Now, however, the challenge in these critical times is to keep “doing what is fine.” (Gal. 6:9) Although this takes real effort, you can do it. How?
2 Cultivate Jesus’ Mental Attitude: Like Jesus, you can endure trials if you keep focused on the Kingdom hope. (Heb. 12:2, 3) Be assured that Jehovah loves you and that he wants you to succeed. (2 Pet. 3:9) Put your full trust in him, confident that he will help you. (1 Cor. 10:13) Persevere in prayer, asking Jehovah to help you endure. (Rom. 12:12) Rejoice in the conviction that your endurance will lead to an approved condition in God’s eyes. (Rom. 5:3-5) Your faithfulness in cultivating “the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had” will bring you personal satisfaction and make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.​—Rom. 15:5; Prov. 27:11.
3 Keep Doing the Right Things: Take full advantage of the provisions Jehovah has made for his people to help them keep doing what is fine. Maintain a good personal routine of reading God’s Word and studying the Bible-based publications of the faithful and discreet slave class. Faithfully prepare for, attend, and participate in all the meetings of the congregation. Before and after Christian meetings, associate closely with your spiritual brothers and sisters. Set realistic goals for your ministry in order to have a meaningful share in the field service and to improve your skills in presenting the good news to others.
4 This is how you can keep doing what is fine and experience much joy at the same time. In this regard, a brother in Italy said: “When evening comes, and I return home after a day in Jehovah’s service, I feel tired, it is true. But I am happy, and I thank Jehovah for having given me a joy that no one can take away.” Accordingly, keep doing what is fine, and you too will experience great joy.

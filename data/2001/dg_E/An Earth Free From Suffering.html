<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>An Earth Free From Suffering</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 1, 2. What different view do many have?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb">HOWEVER, millions of people worldwide have a totally different view. They foresee a marvelous future for mankind. They say that right here on earth there will soon be a world completely free from wickedness and suffering. They are confident that what is bad will soon be cleared away and an entirely new world established. They even say that the foundation of this new world is being laid right now!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>These people believe that the new world will be free from war, cruelty, crime, injustice, and poverty. It will be a world without sickness, sorrow, tears, and even death. At that time people will grow to perfection and live <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>forever in happiness in an earthly paradise. Why, those who have died will even be resurrected and have the opportunity to live forever!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 3, 4. Why do such persons feel confident about their view?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Is this view of the future just a dream, just wishful thinking? No, not at all. It is founded on a solidly based faith that this incoming Paradise is inevitable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>) Why are they so sure? Because the almighty Creator of the universe has promised it.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Regarding God’s promises, the Bible says: “Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” “God is not a man that he should tell lies . . . Has he himself said it and will he not do it, and has he spoken and will he not carry it out?” “Jehovah of armies has sworn, saying: ‘Surely just as I have figured, so it must occur; and just as I have counseled, that is what will come true.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:19-4:23:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Numbers 23:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:24-23:14:24" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isaiah 14:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="qu"> 5. What questions need to be answered?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[11]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>However, if God’s purpose was to establish an earthly paradise free from suffering, why did he permit bad things to happen in the first place? Why did he wait six thousand years until now to correct what is wrong? Might all those centuries of suffering indicate that God does not really care about us, or even that he does not exist?</p>

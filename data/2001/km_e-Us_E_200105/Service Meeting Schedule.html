<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Teachers of God’s Word” District Convention. Use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat pointed counsel from this month’s insert that may be appropriate locally. During the month of October, an entire Service Meeting will be arranged to review convention highlights. In preparation for that discussion, all of us can take meaningful notes at the convention, including a list of the points that we wish to apply personally in our own life and in the field ministry. Then we can be prepared to explain how we have applied those suggestions since attending the convention. It will be mutually upbuilding to hear how we benefited from the good instruction that was received.</p>

They all agree that they do not want to neglect theocratic activities, such as attending congregation meetings, sharing in field service, and having their family Bible study, even if they travel elsewhere.

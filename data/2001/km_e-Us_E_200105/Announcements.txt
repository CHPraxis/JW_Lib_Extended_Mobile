Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Offer the Knowledge book or Require brochure, with a view to starting home Bible studies. June: What Does God Require of Us? or Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Concentrate on starting home Bible studies. July and August: Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, What Happens to Us When We Die?, What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It?, and When Someone You Love Dies. The brochures A Book for All People, Our Problems​—Who Will Help Us Solve Them?, Spirits of the Dead​—Can They Help You or Harm You? Do They Really Exist?, and Will There Ever Be a World Without War? may be offered where appropriate.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Beginning the week of July 30, 2001, we will study Isaiah’s Prophecy​—Light for All Mankind I in the Congregation Book Study.
▪ DISTRICT CONVENTION PARKING: At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. No parking tickets will be used, but convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Being aware that considerable expense is involved, we can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car. At a few locations, this parking arrangement cannot be fully implemented this year. Congregations affected by any variation in this arrangement will be so advised by their local convention headquarters.

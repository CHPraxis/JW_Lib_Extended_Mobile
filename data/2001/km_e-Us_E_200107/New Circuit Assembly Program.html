<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One definition of fear is “profound reverence and awe, especially toward God.” This describes the healthy fear referred to in the Scriptures as “the beginning of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10</a>) In contrast, another kind of fear dominates Satan’s world around us. How can we avoid that unwholesome feeling while developing a reverential fear of Jehovah? The new circuit assembly program for the 2002 service year addresses this question. The theme is “Fear God and Give Him Glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:7-66:14:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 14:7</a>) We will come to appreciate the many ways that fear of Jehovah benefits us as individuals and as an organization.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although fear may imply anxiety or loss of courage and reluctance to face difficult situations, the Bible states: “Happy is everyone fearing Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:128:1-19:128:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 128:1</a>) The assembly program will show us how we can successfully meet the challenges to true worship. We will see how to help new ones cultivate such wholesome fear of God, which will actually motivate them to want to serve him with their whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) The first day concludes with the district overseer’s talk “Draw Ever Closer to Those You Love.” He will explain how we can stay alert to the devilish effort to turn us away from Jehovah, our family, and our Christian brothers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Fear Jehovah, Not Men” is the theme of a four-part symposium on the second day. It will explain why and how we must overcome any fear that hinders us from fully accomplishing our ministry or maintaining our integrity and good conscience at school and in the workplace. The public address “Fear God and Keep His Commandments” is based on the chain of events described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 14</a>. The circuit assembly will conclude with positive direction to “Keep On Walking in the Fear of Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Theocratic Ministry School, model Service Meeting, baptism talk, and summary of the <em>Watchtower </em>Study are additional highlights of the program that you will not want to miss. Invite your Bible students to attend with you. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible. All of us will want to demonstrate our wholesome fear of Jehovah and ascribe glory to him by not missing any part of this outstanding program!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Every good gift and every perfect present” comes down from God, our heavenly Father.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE greatest gift that God has given to fallen mankind is the provision for their recovery by means of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ. The death of Jesus, our Ransomer, makes possible everlasting life on a paradise earth. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>, we are commanded to memorialize his death.</p>

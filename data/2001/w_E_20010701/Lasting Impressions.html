<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EACH year, Jehovah’s Witnesses in their respective countries get together at Christian assemblies and conventions. They do this to enjoy spiritually upbuilding instruction and association. But other aspects of their gatherings can also leave a lasting impression on visitors.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In July 1999, for example, thousands of Witnesses in Mozambique assembled for three enriching days at the “God’s Prophetic Word” District Conventions. Many of those present were attending a convention for the first time. They were impressed not only with the words they heard from the platform but also with what they saw around them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One comment made at the Maputo Assembly Hall was: “I have never seen such a beautiful place as this in all my life! The bathrooms had soap and mirrors, and they even smelled clean. There were peaceful surroundings without the noise of children fighting. And no pushing! I saw happy, young people engaging in encouraging conversations. I was also impressed by the way everyone was so well dressed. Next time, I will bring my children and convince my husband that we must attend this convention.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yes, the honesty, integrity, and physical cleanliness of Jehovah’s Witnesses do not go unnoticed. Why are the Witnesses different? Because they truly try to apply what they learn from the Bible. Why not assemble with them this year at their national conventions or at their weekly meetings at a local Kingdom Hall and see for yourself?</p>

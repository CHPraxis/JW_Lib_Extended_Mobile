<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“There is not a single thing you can do in an ordinary day<wbr />—sleeping included—<wbr />that isn’t risky enough to be the <em>last </em>thing you ever do.”<wbr />—<em>Discover </em>magazine.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">LIFE has been compared to walking through a minefield, for injury or death can come at any time, often without warning. Risk factors vary from country to country. They include traffic accidents, civil war, famine, AIDS, cancer, heart disease, and a host of other things. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, AIDS has become the number one killer, in a recent year “claiming 2.2 million lives, 10 times the death toll from all of Africa’s civil wars,” says <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the meantime, the world spends billions on prolonging life and reducing the risk of illness and disability. Many of the ideas promoted, such as sensible eating and drinking habits and physical exercise, can produce some beneficial results. However, there is a source of trustworthy information on every important facet of living that can help you to enjoy a safer, more secure life. That source is the Bible. It contains guidelines for handling a broad range of concerns that affect our health and welfare. Of course, the Bible does not deal with every problem in detail. Yet, it does provide excellent principles to guide us in such matters as eating habits, physical fitness, mental attitude, sex, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and so-called recreational drugs, and numerous other things.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Life for many is also fraught with financial uncertainties. Here, too, the Bible comes to our aid. Not only does it encourage a wise view of money and money management but it also shows how to be a better employee or employer. Simply put, the Bible is a sound guide, not just for financial security and physical well-being, but for life itself. Would you like to see how practical the Bible can be today? Then please read on.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">‘IT DOUBLED my pride in my father!’ exclaimed a 12-year-old girl in a letter to the India branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She was referring to the item “Interested Fathers Have Happier Sons,” in the “Watching the World” section of the August 22, 1999, <em>Awake! </em>It reported one study’s conclusion that when fathers show personal interest in their sons, these become adults who are full of confidence and hope.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The girl said that she is grateful that she and her twin sister are blessed with a father who shows such personal interest in them. She noted that she enjoys the way <em>Awake! </em>reports on world events, adding that “it is a very useful magazine for students today.”</p>

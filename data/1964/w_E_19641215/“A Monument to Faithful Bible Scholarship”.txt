“A Monument to Faithful Bible Scholarship”
✔ Having recently obtained a copy of the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” a man in the United States wrote to the publishers, the Watchtower Society, saying: “I recently received my copy of ‘All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.’ In my opinion, this book is a monument to faithful Bible scholarship. The man-hours and research that must have gone into the volume are impressive. It is the most extensive one-volume treatment of the Scriptures I have read. Having read The Interpreter’s Bible, Hasting’s Dictionary of the Bible (revised edition), and the Beacon Bible Commentary, the latter two being in my personal library, I am immediately struck by a major difference between your work and that of other competent scholars: Yours magnifies the Bible as the inspired Word of God. Rather than explain away areas of conflict between the Scriptures, science and secular history, your book proves the correctness of the Biblical accounts.”

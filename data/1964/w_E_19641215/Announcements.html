<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Keeping filled with the spirit of God requires that we continually avail ourselves of the means that God has provided by which we can receive his spirit. Throughout December Jehovah’s witnesses will seek to aid persons everywhere to do this by offering them the modern-language <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>along with the book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” </em>on a contribution of $2.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>AN EXPANDING PROGRAM OF PRAISE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Each year since 1927 the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>has recorded the growth of the fruitful ministry of Jehovah God’s authentic witnesses. This society of ministers, active in modern times since the 1870’s, has literally covered the earth with its preaching. This past year has been no exception; in fact, this program of praise has expanded to new limits, with excellent prospects of even more activity in the months ahead. You will want to obtain and read this year’s fascinating report, the 1965 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>It is 50c. And, as a further stimulus to faith and right works on your own part, you will want the beautifully illustrated 1965 calendar. Send an additional 25c. Do it today!</p>

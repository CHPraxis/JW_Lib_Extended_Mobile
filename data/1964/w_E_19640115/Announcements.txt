FIELD MINISTRY
What must one do to put up a fine fight for the faith? He must publish that faith before “many witnesses.” (1 Tim. 6:12) Jehovah’s witnesses will be doing that during January by preaching and teaching from the Bible, and by offering to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, together with three booklets on the Bible, for a contribution of $1.
COURAGE TO SPEAK BOLDLY
It takes courage to speak boldly and fearlessly in the face of extreme opposition. It takes conviction, too, an assurance that what is said is right and profitable. The early disciples of Jesus had such conviction, and the reason for it is stated in Acts 4:31: “They were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.” Such aggressive fearlessness has been lost almost completely in Christendom, but thousands of persons each year are finding it in this magazine you hold, The Watchtower. Scan its pages, turn to the inside front cover and consider its purpose, then send for a year’s subscription. It is only $1. Send at once and receive free three timely booklets on Bible subjects.

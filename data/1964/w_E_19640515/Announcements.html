<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Righteousness, which is a peaceable fruit that results from accepting godly discipline, leads one to fruitful activity. During May Jehovah’s witnesses will share in such fruitful activity by directing all persons to Jehovah’s Word and helping them to appreciate his righteous ways. They will do this by giving Bible sermons and by offering the new book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>together with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of 75c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“FAITH . . . IS THROUGH THE WORD”</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The apostle Paul said: “Faith follows the thing heard. In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:17</a>) Yet there are so many differing ‘things heard’ about Christ that many persons are confused. How can you be sure? You should get an accurate knowledge of the Bible itself so that you can prove everything by the Bible. Do this with the book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </em>It is not an interpretative study. It is designed to familiarize you with the Bible as a book and to help you use it with greater benefit to yourself. Send for your copy today. It is $1.</p>

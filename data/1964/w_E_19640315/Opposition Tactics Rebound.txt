Opposition Tactics Rebound
◆ In the State of São Paulo, Brazil, some young students were incited to harass Jehovah’s witnesses as they preached from house to house. The youths followed the Witnesses and made a terrible noise with tin cans and firecrackers. A young lady observed what happened. She thought the interference ridiculous and was very indignant about it, as she well knew the Witnesses’ good behavior and work. The incident had aroused her interest. A home Bible study was started and she has progressed in knowledge, attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and announcing the Kingdom good news.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Witness now living in Missouri relates this experience had while she was working one day on an Indian Reservation in South Dakota: “I met a man who was a layman for the Catholic Church. On the reservation there is a church for each village but not a priest, so the priests take turns visiting each week at a different village. When the priest cannot be at the church, then the Indian layman reads a printed sermon sent by the priest. The layman accepted <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>from me, and I asked him if I could call back and get his opinion about them. About two weeks later I called back and he was excited. He said: ‘Last Sunday the priest did not come to church and he did not mail me a sermon, so I read <em>The Watchtower </em>in the Catholic church and everybody enjoyed it. Usually everybody goes to sleep in church, but when I read <em>The Watchtower </em>nobody went to sleep.’ After leaving there we called on people of the town and placed about ninety magazines, and several subscriptions were taken. Many had their interest aroused by <em>The Watchtower </em>read in church.”</p>

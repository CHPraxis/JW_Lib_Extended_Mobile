The Parishioners Stayed Awake
A Witness now living in Missouri relates this experience had while she was working one day on an Indian Reservation in South Dakota: “I met a man who was a layman for the Catholic Church. On the reservation there is a church for each village but not a priest, so the priests take turns visiting each week at a different village. When the priest cannot be at the church, then the Indian layman reads a printed sermon sent by the priest. The layman accepted The Watchtower and Awake! from me, and I asked him if I could call back and get his opinion about them. About two weeks later I called back and he was excited. He said: ‘Last Sunday the priest did not come to church and he did not mail me a sermon, so I read The Watchtower in the Catholic church and everybody enjoyed it. Usually everybody goes to sleep in church, but when I read The Watchtower nobody went to sleep.’ After leaving there we called on people of the town and placed about ninety magazines, and several subscriptions were taken. Many had their interest aroused by The Watchtower read in church.”

FIELD MINISTRY
Throughout March Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the good news, not only by leading clean moral lives, but also by sharing the Kingdom message with all they meet. They will be offering to all persons a year’s subscription for the outstanding Bible-study aid, The Watchtower, together with three Bible booklets, on a contribution of $1.

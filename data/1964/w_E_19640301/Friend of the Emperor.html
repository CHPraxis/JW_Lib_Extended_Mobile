<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:12-44:18:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 18:12-16</a> tells how the apostle Paul, when in Corinth, was brought before Gallio, the “proconsul of Achaia.” The judgment seat before which Paul undoubtedly appeared was found by archaeologists, as well as a letter of Emperor Claudius that says: “As Lucius Junius Gallio, my friend, and the proconsul of Achaia wrote.” The letter indicates Gallio came to Corinth A.D. 51, harmonizing with the time of Paul’s visit indicated in the Bible.</p>

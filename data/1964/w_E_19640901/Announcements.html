<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible, the book of “everlasting good news,” is indeed beneficial to all and for all things, and it is deserving of sincere consideration. It points the way to life everlasting and exposes those who hinder others in seeking to attain it. As an aid to life seekers, during September Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to present the 704-page Bible-study aid <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>with a booklet, for 75c.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● </strong>Even while ill, Jehovah’s witnesses are a comfort to others, including those who are attending them in their illness. This can be seen from what took place when a Witness in Toronto, Canada, found it necessary to go to a hospital. She says: “Last October when I spent two weeks in a hospital I had opportunity to witness to nine people, some patients, and others who were employees. One of the employees was a German lady who accepted the magazines from me and asked many questions. After I left the hospital I corresponded with all to whom I had spoken, sending them magazines. I heard from three of them soon afterward. To those who lived in the city I sent along my telephone number. Two days later I had a phone call from the German lady and she thanked me for the magazines. She said she is very tired at the end of the day and cannot bring herself to write a letter, but she was glad to give me a call on the phone.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“She told me, among many things, that she had been promoted at the hospital and because of it was being treated very coldly by her fellow workers. She said, ‘I ate alone and was alone. I didn’t know what to do. Then I got your magazines and your nice letter and I was so happy. I read the first article, which you said I shouldn’t miss, on “Mildness Is Wisdom.” How much better I felt and how glad I was that I didn’t say anything to my fellow workers but just kept quiet! I am glad I remained mild, it was the right course.’ The lady subscribed for the magazines and says that she reads them every night and really enjoys them.”</p>

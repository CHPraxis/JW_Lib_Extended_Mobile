FIELD MINISTRY
The Bible, the book of “everlasting good news,” is indeed beneficial to all and for all things, and it is deserving of sincere consideration. It points the way to life everlasting and exposes those who hinder others in seeking to attain it. As an aid to life seekers, during September Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to present the 704-page Bible-study aid “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, with a booklet, for 75c.
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE BIBLE?
Do you know why there are two histories of the nation of Israel in the Bible, the two books of Kings and the two books of Chronicles? Do you know why Paul wrote his two letters to the Corinthians? Could you relate the chief events of Jesus’ ministry? The new 352 page book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” will give you a new view of the Bible. It will give you valuable background information about every book of the Bible as well as an epitome of the contents of each book. Besides, it emphasizes the value of the Bible in our modern, everyday living. Send only $1.

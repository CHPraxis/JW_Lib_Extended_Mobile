<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">All of Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate association with fellow Christians as they share in Jehovah’s service. It is strengthening and brings mutual encouragement. Besides that, their ministry is a source of encouragement to others who long for a knowledge of God’s Word. To aid such persons, during July Jehovah’s witnesses will offer the 704-page book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>along with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of 75c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By now the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses are a happy memory to thousands. But to many thousands more the prospect of spiritual blessings to be poured out at these conventions is still future. Many more gatherings of this series in widely scattered cities are still ahead of us, and you too can share. But you must act quickly if you have not already made your plans. For details, write to Watchtower Convention, in care of the publishers of this magazine.</p>

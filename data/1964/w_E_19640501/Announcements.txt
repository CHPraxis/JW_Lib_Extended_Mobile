FIELD MINISTRY
Righteousness, which is a peaceable fruit that results from accepting godly discipline, leads one to fruitful activity. During May Jehovah’s witnesses will share in such fruitful activity by directing all persons to Jehovah’s Word and helping them to appreciate his righteous ways. They will do this by giving Bible sermons and by offering the new book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, together with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of 75c.
YOUR LIFE IS AFFECTED TOO!
Stranger than fiction is the dramatic story of the spread of religion throughout the world. But, did you know that a vast system of false worship has grown up over the centuries that has fastened its tentacles on every phase of man’s life the world over? And did you know that, whether you consider yourself to be religious or not, your own life is affected by it? How has it come about and what is your protection? Obtain and read the 704 page hardbound book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! Send only 75c. Do it today and receive free the booklet God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?

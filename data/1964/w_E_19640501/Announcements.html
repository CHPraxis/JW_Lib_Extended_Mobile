<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Righteousness, which is a peaceable fruit that results from accepting godly discipline, leads one to fruitful activity. During May Jehovah’s witnesses will share in such fruitful activity by directing all persons to Jehovah’s Word and helping them to appreciate his righteous ways. They will do this by giving Bible sermons and by offering the new book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>together with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of 75c.</p>

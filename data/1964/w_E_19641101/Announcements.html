<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">History often seems remote. It may well be to another generation, but not to those who live it. Ours is a history-making generation too, history that will never be repeated because our generation marks the climactic end of the history of vast empires. One international system that has affected the history of governments for centuries has already begun to topple! You should know how and why, and what the outcome will be because it affects your life! Send for and read the fascinating 704-page book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>Send 75c. Write at once and you will receive free the booklet <em>God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?</em></p>

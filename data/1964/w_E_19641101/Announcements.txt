FIELD MINISTRY
It is the privilege and responsibility of those who have already been liberated from Babylon the Great to help others who are unwilling captives of that wicked empire of oppression to “get out of her.” That you can do during November by sharing in the distribution of the revealing book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! It will be placed, along with a Bible study booklet, for 75c.
OUR HISTORY-MAKING GENERATION
History often seems remote. It may well be to another generation, but not to those who live it. Ours is a history-making generation too, history that will never be repeated because our generation marks the climactic end of the history of vast empires. One international system that has affected the history of governments for centuries has already begun to topple! You should know how and why, and what the outcome will be because it affects your life! Send for and read the fascinating 704-page book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! Send 75c. Write at once and you will receive free the booklet God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?

FIELD MINISTRY
During June Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share unitedly in the ministry, so cooperating together to maintain their spiritual maturity. As they do so they will be aiding others to acquire the Scriptural knowledge they need in order to serve God. This they will do by offering the modern-English New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, with a free Bible study booklet, on a contribution of $1. To those who read Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish, they will offer the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures for just 50c.
1964 DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES
This year the Watch Tower Society will sponsor a series of “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses in many cities. This arrangement will make it possible for you to attend, because one of these district assemblies is certain to be near your home. At each assembly the program will begin on Thursday afternoon and conclude on Sunday at about 6 p.m. Plan now to attend and receive the rich benefits in store for all. For further details write Watch Tower Convention in care of the publishers of this magazine.

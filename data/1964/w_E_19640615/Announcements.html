<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During June Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share unitedly in the ministry, so cooperating together to maintain their spiritual maturity. As they do so they will be aiding others to acquire the Scriptural knowledge they need in order to serve God. This they will do by offering the modern-English <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>with a free Bible study booklet, on a contribution of $1. To those who read Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish, they will offer the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>for just 50c.</p>

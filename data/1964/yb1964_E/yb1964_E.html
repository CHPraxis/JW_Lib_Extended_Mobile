<p><span class="font2">OF JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Christian apostles Peter and John had been in custody before. So being arrested and jailed now was no new experience for them. But to have an angel of Jehovah open the door of the prison and tell them and their fellow apostles to be on their way was something new. Such an experience must have instilled confidence, strengthened their faith and helped them in their fearless position already taken against the religious leaders of Jerusalem. The religious leaders had shown fear of this small band of Christian ministers and their successful work. “The high priest and all those with him, the then existing sect of the Sadducees, rose and became filled with jealousy, and they laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public place of custody.” (Acts 5:17, 18) What had these men said or done to arouse jealousy on the part of these religionists and make them take such action? Let us see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was not many days before this happening that the apostles and others with them, 120 in all, were “filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4) It was on that very day of the Festival of Pentecost that Peter stood up with the eleven and spoke to the men of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Peter told them about Jesus the Naza-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rene, how he had been fastened to a stake by the hands of lawless men and killed, and how God had resurrected Jesus by loosening the pangs of death. Peter spoke fearlessly. He told the truth about the impaling of Jesus Christ outside Jerusalem fifty-one days previously. Listening attentively to the words of Peter, that great crowd of people heard his exhortation to repent. Peter said: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.” “And with many other words he bore thorough witness and kept exhorting them, saying: ‘Get saved from this crooked generation.’ ” There were many there who embraced Peter’s words heartily and were baptized, and on “that day about three thousand souls were added. And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles.” (Acts 2:38-42) This great crowd of people that had come to Jerusalem from many nations, some from as far away as Rome, were in constant attendance at the temple day after day listening to the truth from God’s Word. Before returning home they were anxious to learn all they could about the fulfillment of prophecy and about this impaled one, Jesus Christ, the Son of Jehovah God. How many persons today are anxious to learn “all the sayings about this life” ? In our generation you can hardly find a person who reads his Bible daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, nineteen hundred years ago the temple area in Jerusalem, where Jesus did considerable preaching, was the center of attraction for gaining the latest information. From Pentecost on, the apostles were there busily giving out the most important information, telling the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens, the exaltation of Christ Jesus to the right hand of God and the promised holy spirit from the Father that was being poured out daily upon believers. There was much evidence of the pouring out of this holy spirit, because “Jehovah continued to join to them daily those being saved.” (Acts 2:47) The Christian religion was getting a real foothold. No wonder, then, that the Jewish religionists were getting jealous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible account in the following chapter tells us: “Now Peter and John were going up into the temple for the hour of prayer, the ninth hour, and a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, and they would daily put him near the temple door.” Here this crippled man would “ask [for] gifts of mercy from those entering into the temple.” It was quite natural, then, for him to ask Peter and John for gifts of mercy. Peter and John stopped and gazed at this lame man and said: “Take a look at us.” So the man did and was surprised to hear Peter say: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have is what I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!” Peter reached out and took the lame man by the right hand and raised him up. A miracle occurred! “Instantly the soles of his feet and his ankle bones were made firm; and, leaping up, he stood up and began walking, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.”—Acts 3:1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a wonderful thing! Unbelievable, but many people were coming into the temple and recognized that this one now walking about was the same man who used to be lame. “Well, as the man was holding onto Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at what was called Solomon’s colonnade, surprised out of their wits.” (Acts 3: 11) This gave Peter a wonderful opportunity to talk about Jesus Christ. He certainly did not want them to believe that what had happened was due to any personal power of his. He said: “Men of Israel, why are you wondering over this, or why are you gazing at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk? The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom you, for your part, delivered up and disowned before Pilate’s face, when he had decided to release him. Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one, and you asked for a man, a murderer, to be freely granted to you, whereas you killed the Chief Agent of life. But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses. Consequently his name, by our faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you behold and know, and the faith that is through him has given the man this complete soundness in the sight of all of you. And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers also did. But in this way God has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer. Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven, indeed, must hold within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time.” (Acts 3:12-21) Do you believe what Peter said then? Is your faith in Jesus Christ and Jehovah God as strong as Peter’s? Do you speak to others about your Christian faith as plainly as he did? If not, why not? Are you afraid that what happened to Peter and John will happen to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us see what happened when the two apostles attracted great crowds by the miracle performed and by their freeness of speech: “Now while the two were speaking to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, being annoyed because they were teaching the people and were plainly declaring the resurrection from the dead in the case of Jesus; and they laid their hands upon them and put them in custody till the next day, for it was already evening. However, many of those who had listened to the speech believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.” (Acts 4:1-4) Of course, during the previous days thousands of people had associated themselves with these faithful followers of Christ Jesus and had become Christians. The message of Peter and John was making Jews repent, and they were leaving the Jewish religion. Really, the ones who should have accepted Christ Jesus were the leaders among the people, namely, their rulers and their priests. They knew the Scriptures and should have seen the fulfillment of prophecy before their very eyes, but these leaders were no more interested in God’s kingdom and Christ Jesus in their day than are the rulers and religious priests today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The present-day religious clergy of Christendom are acting just like the priests and Sadducees of Jesus’ time. The leaders of the masses try to keep the people in line through threats and little irritations. They cannot find real fault with the individual Christian’s excellent work, but what the Christian does is not to their liking and reflects on their prestige, so stop—scare them! What had Peter and John done that was wrong and that led to their being put in jail? The only thing that the rulers could find fault with in Peter and John was that they had told the truth to too many people and did something good to a lame man. They had healed that man, a man who had been lame from the time of his birth and now was forty years old. They had not asked permission from the rulers to do this good deed and to preach the truth. Now the way to stop them was to put them in jail for a night. That should take the spirit of God out of them, they thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INTIMIDATION FAILS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This was the first time that Peter and John were put into custody, held overnight in jail. This intimidation did not disturb Peter and John at all. The next day when they were asked by the rulers, “By what power or in whose name did you do this?” here was what happened: “Then Peter, filled with holy spirit, said to them: ‘Rulers of the people and older men, if we are this day being examined, on the basis of a good deed to an ailing man, as to by whom this man has been made well, let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you impaled but whom God raised up from the dead, by this one does this man stand here sound in front of you.’ ” Then they told Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas, as well as many others who were kinsfolk of the chief priest, that they were the ones that rejected Jesus and that “there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.” (Acts 4:7-12) Then Peter used a powerful illustration. He went back to the writings of David, quoting from Psalm 118:22. Peter pointed to scripture in which they should believe and he showed the fulfillment of prophecy. David had written that the stone that the builders rejected had become the head of the corner. Would they now listen when Peter said: “This is ‘the stone that was treated by you builders as of no account that has become the head of the corner’ ”? (Acts 4:11) Peter and John very likely had in mind the words of the prophet Isaiah, too, who wrote: “Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, you braggarts, . . . ‘Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, the precious corner of a sure foundation. No one exercising faith will get panicky.’ ”—Isa. 28:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Peter and John were not panicky but spoke boldly to the Jewish rulers who had cried out to Pilate about Jesus: “Let him be impaled!” (Matt. 27:15-26) They showed their faith and courage even though being in prison one night and then being brought to stand before these august men. This did not disturb their thinking. They were there for a purpose—to speak fearlessly about the true God and his Son, Jesus Christ, the only “name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Peter and John were ordinary fishermen by trade, and the people knew them as such. But it could be seen that they had walked with Jesus, had listened to his words and were trained by him. They had something else, too—the holy spirit from God. All this would make them act differently from most persons. This difference was noticed by these rulers. “Now when they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering. And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus; and as they were looking at the man that had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in rebuttal.”—Acts 4:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The religious leaders, immediately having a problem they did not know how to cope with, told Peter and John to step outside the Sanhedrin hall, and these “wise” men began to consult with one another, saying: “What shall we do with these men?” They certainly could not ignore or deny what had happened. All the inhabitants of Jerusalem by now knew what had occurred. Fearing the people, the rulers came to a conclusion: “Let us tell them with threats not to speak any more upon the basis of this name to any man at all.” —Acts 4:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CLERICAL FEAR OF WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Similar action has been taken today against Christians in the nations of the earth that call themselves Christian. Religious leaders get just as fearful of the same message that true Christians, Jehovah’s witnesses, preach worldwide today. They will do everything within their power to stop the message of God’s kingdom from being given. For example, in Greece, in the summer of 1963, the archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church, Chrysostomos, threatened the Greek government that he would organize a march from Salonika to Athens if the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was allowed to meet in Athens. He had his way, as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily American</span><span class="font8"> newspaper of July 26,1963, pointed out: “The Greek government has banned all public meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, it was announced today . . . Archbishop Chrysostomos, primate of Greece, has led all Greek Orthodox organizations in a general outcry against the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ rally, which he called a ‘shameful congress of atheists and anarchists.’ In a letter to the prime minister, Panayotis Pipinelis, he said unless the rally were banned, he would be compelled to ‘defend everything sacred and to lead the clergy and the people’ in an all-out action against the sect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What was the archbishop afraid of, or, for that matter, what are all the Greek Orthodox clergy afraid of? Bible study? The distribution of the Bible? Encouragement given to the Greek people to read the Bible? All the world knows that Jehovah’s witnesses devote their time to aiding people around the world to read and understand the Bible in their own language. Is that what the archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church labels atheism and anarchy, the study of the Word of God? the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom? Is he against having the Greek people walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus? Who really is the anarchist, the disrupter of government? Who wanted to make all people rise up and march from Salonika to Athens and break up Jehovah’s witnesses’ peaceful meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Greek Orthodox Church was successful in its threats against the government and it was able to dictate the action that the government of Greece took, namely, cancel the approved meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses on July 30, 1963. In Jesus’ day Caiaphas, the high priest, and the howling Jews shouted at the ruler, Pilate, “Let him be impaled!” Even Pilate, the ruler in the Roman province, did not want Jesus killed; but when he saw that an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You yourselves must see to it.” “At that all the people said in answer: ‘His blood come upon us and upon our children.’ Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be impaled.” (Matt. 27:24-26) You hear the same kind of cries today by false religionists against true followers of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Despite all the outcries of the Greek clergy, Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece increased by 9 percent during the year 1963. There are now 10,507 of Jehovah’s witnesses, all Christians, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They have spent more than 1,100,000 hours talking to persons interested in Bible study. Have the Greek Orthodox clergy spent that much time going from house to house teaching the people of Greece the things they learned from God’s Word? Or, have they spent most of their time telling the people not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses and seeing to it that Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested for teaching the Bible to people who want to hear? Have the Greek clergy gone to the homes of their parishioners and conducted 4,245 Bible studies each week with persons who want to know what the Bible contains? We wish they would! Jehovah’s witnesses did that in Greece in the year 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the days of the apostles, it was false religionists who tried to stop the faithful followers of Christ from preaching the good news, and today it is false religionists who are doing the same thing. Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and the Protestant clergy are not training all their congregation members to be ministers; rather, their members feel they should keep quiet and not say a word about Jesus or his kingdom to anyone else. Is that walking in the steps of Jesus Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Returning to the account in Acts, we find that the religious leaders called the apostles back into their presence and “charged them, nowhere to make any utterance or to teach upon the basis of the name of Jesus. But in reply Peter and John said to them: ‘Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves. But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.’ ”—Acts 4:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So it must be today for every person who claims to be a Christian. If your “church” does not encourage you to preach publicly and from house to house about God’s kingdom, then heed heaven’s command: “Get out of her ... if you do not want to share with her in her sins . . . and receive part of her plagues.” (Rev. 18:4, 5) You must speak about the things you have seen and heard in God’s Word. You cannot be silent! When, for instance, the Greek Orthodox Church claims that no one (in this case meaning Jehovah’s witnesses) may go about doing proselyting work, that is, preaching to other people about the Bible, they are going absolutely contrary to the commandment of God as stated in the Bible, God’s Word. What were Peter and John doing in Jerusalem? They were preaching God’s Word to the Jews, changing them from one religion to another, from traditional Jews to Christians. They were able to do it because they were preaching the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a similar thing today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler, a Roman Catholic, the arm of his church in Germany, forbade Jehovah’s witnesses to preach the kingdom of God, and these modernday Christians had to say to Hitler’s Gestapo police: ‘Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves.’ They kept preaching even though 10,000 of them were put in concentration camps and over 4,000 died there. The rest nearly starved to death. The war’s end aided their survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1933 Hitler signed a concordat with the Roman Catholic Church, even as Mussolini, the head of the Italian government in his day, had done. But even if the rulers of countries make agreements with religious organizations, Jehovah’s witnesses living in those countries cannot forget God’s Word. They must serve God, ‘speaking about the things we have seen and heard.’ Even though these were threatened with death, the rulers were unable to stop the preaching activity of Jehovah’s people. Today Hitler and Mussolini are gone, but Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching in greater numbers than ever in their countries. Today there are 78,045 ministers in West Germany, and in Italy there are 7,801 witnesses of Jehovah telling out the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one can destroy the truth. Truth is always right, though everyone opposes it. The apostle Paul said: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Rom. 3:4) Just because Peter and John spoke the truth, saying they healed a lame man in the name of Jesus, they were jailed and threatened. Finally they were released because the Jewish court “did not find any ground on which to punish them and on account of the people.”—Acts 4:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Peter and John hastened “to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them.” Then, all together, they raised their voices to God and said: “ ‘Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.’ Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. ’ ’—Acts 4:23-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just as it was in the days of the apostles, so Christians today must put up with the empty things the rulers meditate on. Just because Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute the flag of Liberia under pressure by the army, Watch Tower Society missionaries were expelled from that country. It is easy for the religious president, Tubman, to say “the Jehovah’s Witnesses as a sect are welcome in this country [Liberia] but they will be required to conform to the law requiring all persons to salute the flag when it is being hoisted or lowered at ceremonies in their sight, or keep away from such ceremonies.” But the question must be asked of the president: How can Christians keep away from such a ceremony, which is idolatrous, when an army comes to an assembly ground of Jehovah’s witnesses and at gunpoint makes everyone march to a compound where a flag is raised and where force is used to try to make everyone salute the flag of the Republic of Liberia? Will that make the individual a better Liberian or a better Christian? This whole story appears in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine of August 8, 1963. Has President Tubman put himself in the class of Hitler and Mussolini?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ruler in Haiti too expelled missionaries who were carrying on a good work of preaching God’s kingdom and teaching the people to study the Bible. In Spain Christian missionaries have been expelled because of conducting Bible studies in people’s homes. The same is true of Portugal. Meeting places in private homes of Jehovah’s witnesses in Roman Catholic Spain and Portugal have been invaded, and many individuals have been put in prison. Why? Because those people were studying the Bible with other Christians. So the rulers have taken their stand and have massed together against Jehovah and against his servants. They must certainly know that Jehovah’s witnesses are not interested in upsetting their governments or causing any disturbance to them. The rulers further know that Jehovah’s witnesses are well-behaved people. Why must the ruler be fearful? The only reason is that Jehovah’s witnesses preach the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Are you preaching this good news today? If you are, you too are doing Christian work and someday will be as much looked down upon by false religionists as the apostles were. Do not be surprised if it happens to you. Christians can expect such treatment. Jesus said: “You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.”—Matt. 10:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPEAKING WITH BOLDNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nineteen hundred years ago Peter and John asked Jehovah God to “give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.” This prayer God answered right away, because “they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:29,31) Jehovah did not show any partiality then, neither does he now, for it is the same holy spirit, God’s active force, that each dedicated servant of God wants so he can speak with the boldness necessary to keep on declaring the Word of God even though threats come from archbishops, presidents or dictators of countries, clergy or anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of “speaking the word of God with boldness” today Christians will have the same results as Peter and John had, regardless of threats and opposition. They, too, can joyfully say: “Believers in the Lord kept on being added, multitudes both of men and of women.”—Acts 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people in Jerusalem were interested in truth and wanted to hear what the apostles had to say. But not so the false religionists! So again “the high priest and all those with him, the then existing sect of the Sadducees, rose and became filled with jealousy, and they laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public place of custody.” (Acts 5:17, 18) This was the second time for Peter and John, but they had company. The rest of the apostles were locked up with them too. Now something very unusual happened. The angel of Jehovah stepped into the picture and did what Jehovah told him to do. The apostles were unafraid, being well acquainted with the words of the psalmist: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them,” and they would remember what Jesus said: “For I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.” (Ps. 34:7; Matt. 18:6,10) They also knew that angels took a great interest in happenings on the earth. They were acquainted with the facts of the birth of Jesus when the shepherds were living out of doors and watching their flocks. “And suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood by them, and Jehovah’s glory gleamed around them, . . . and suddenly there came to be with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God.” (Luke 2:9, 13) All these thoughts may have flashed through their minds when “during the night Jehovah’s angel opened the doors of the prison, [and] brought them out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can you imagine the astonishment, the look of amazement on their faces? The doors of the prison opened. No protest came from the guards. Here is an angel directing them out of the prison. When they are all outside, the angel speaks: “Be on your way, and, having taken a stand in the temple, keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.”—Acts 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What could be more definite! The command given to the apostles by the angel could not be made any plainer than that. Some days earlier they had asked Jehovah God to give attention to the threats of the rulers “and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.” When “they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.” For doing this the whole group of apostles were imprisoned this time. Now, here is more assurance that they had done the right thing. An angel is pointing toward the temple: “Be on your way, and, having taken a stand in the temple, keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.” What satisfaction this must have meant to them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostles had been in the temple day after day doing what God told them to do, and thousands of people had heard them preach. There at the temple is where they belonged. There is where Jehovah was going to keep them, despite the religionists. What joy, what confidence, what gratitude was theirs! They were right in what they were doing! The religionists were wrong and fighting against God. Here was a direct command from Jehovah by his angel or messenger as to what to do. Were they filled with zeal? O yes! “After hearing this, they entered into the temple at daybreak and began to teach.”—Acts 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EXTENDING THE GOOD NEWS WORLDWIDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was no stopping the apostles then, and there will be no stopping of Jehovah’s witnesses today, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. Why? Because the truth from God’s Word must be preached. Jehovah’s witnesses have the very same command that the apostles had. They have the very same message from the Word of God and they believe it just as firmly today as did the apostles. The work of declaring this good news of God’s kingdom around the whole earth is getting greater every year. This is no time for Christians to be fearful. At Pentecost the Christians began preaching in Jerusalem, first at the upper room. In time they took in all the Promised Land and then a much larger assignment, an assignment Jesus said must be covered: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” —Matt. 28:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses today are trying hard to accomplish the very thing that Jesus commanded his followers to keep doing, namely, fulfill their commission to disciple people of all nations. They bear constantly in mind these words: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) Jehovah’s witnesses still seek angelic direction but now go to God’s written Word to see what is to be done. We can see in our mind’s eye what John saw in vision: “And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying in a loud voice: ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.’” (Rev. 14:6,7) That is an assignment! Not just for the angel, but for those who appreciate the work God wants done on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses today fully realize that Jehovah God has used angels in times past, and while they do not actually see the angel flying in midheaven now, they do see through John’s vision that the message of this angel must be declared today in its every detail. More than one million proclaimers of the “everlasting good news” are going from house to house around this earth declaring glad tidings to everyone everywhere regardless of his circumstances or nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So what was happening back there in Jerusalem on a small scale with the angel freeing the apostles and telling them to go into the temple area, there to speak again, is occurring in these last days on a worldwide scale. The angel in midheaven is directing God’s people to preach the “everlasting good news,” that everyone may have the opportunity to “fear God and give him glory.” No one who is dedicated to Jehovah can hesitate for a minute from telling all peoples to “worship the one who made the heaven and the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rulers and false religionists of the earth today do not like Jehovah’s witnesses to do this any more than the rulers and priests did in the days of the apostles. When Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested today they usually have to stay in prison longer than the apostles experienced in these accounts, but in God’s due time they are released. It took ten years or more to release many of Jehovah’s witnesses from the concentration camps in Hitler’s time, but these Christians did get out; and today they are listening to the angel flying in midheaven and, with their brothers worldwide, are declaring the everlasting good news as glad tidings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us look at our apostolic patternmakers again, our exemplars in good works. Right at daybreak the apostles entered into the temple and began to teach. Now when the high priest and the Sadducees had got together and they assembled the older men of the sons of Israel, and they sent out to the jail to have the apostles brought to them, they learned from the officers that the apostles were not there. These men reported to the religious leaders: “The jail we found locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but on opening up we found no one inside.” The angel had taken care of everything. After he had opened the doors of the prison and had brought the apostles out, then he closed them again, locked them, and none of the guards knew what had happened, except now they learned they were guarding an empty prison. This was a disturbing situation for the captain of the temple and for the chief priests. Just about this time, when they were all worrying and were concerned over what had taken place, a certain man arrived and reported to them: “Look! The men you put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.” This was where the angel had instructed them to go and that is where they went, to do the work God had directed them to do. “Then the captain went off with his officers and proceeded to bring” the apostles to this religious crowd, “but without violence, as they were afraid of being stoned by the people.” —Acts 5:20-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEYING GOD RATHER THAN MEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the apostles stood before these rulers in the Sanhedrin hall and heard the questions of the high priest, they were not quivering and were not fearful. They had the protection of Jehovah God and of the unseen angels. Therefore after the rulers said: “We positively ordered you not to keep teaching upon the basis of this name, and yet, look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us,” Peter and the other apostles said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men. The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew, hanging him upon a stake. God exalted this one as Chief Agent and Savior to his right hand, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses of these matters, and so is the holy spirit, which God has given to those obeying him as ruler.” (Acts 5:27-32) It took boldness to say what they did to the rulers, but what they said was the truth. They were Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is the very position every dedicated Christian must take today. Knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus, causes a Christian to declare that Jesus Christ has been exalted as Chief Agent and Savior and now sits at the right hand of his Father “until I [Jehovah] place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”—Acts 2:34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Faithfulness to the Christian mission means some inconveniences, threats, hardships and trials, and perhaps even death in some instances. So the priests and Sadducees felt ill-disposed toward the apostles, as the record shows: “When they heard this, they felt deeply cut and were wanting to do away with them.” (Acts 5:33) Sometime later Stephen was stoned to death because he spoke the truth. (Acts 7:54-60) In this modern age we see like things happening when fanatics, filled with the spirit of this world, object to the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses. Still, when a Christian knows he is right and is commissioned to declare the “everlasting good news,” he continues to preach the glad tidings with boldness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During all this excitement back there in the days of the apostles, a man of wisdom, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, stood up and said: “Men of Israel, pay attention to yourselves as to what you intend to do respecting these men. For instance, before these days Theudas rose, saying he himself was somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined his party. But he was done away with, and all those who were obeying him were dispersed and came to nothing. After him Judas the Galilean rose in the days of the registration, and he drew off people after him. And yet that man perished, and all those who were obeying him were scattered abroad. And so, under the present circumstances, I say to you, Do not meddle with these men, but let them alone; (because, if this scheme and this work is from men, it will be overthrown; but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them;) otherwise, you may perhaps be found fighters actually against God.” At this they gave heed to Gamaliel, “and they summoned the apostles, flogged them, and ordered them to stop speaking upon the basis of Jesus’ name, and let them go.” There should be more men today like Gamaliel to counsel the religious leaders and rulers as to the course they should take.—Acts 5:35-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flogging did not change matters for the apostles. They had been beaten before. They had been in prison before. They had been threatened before. There was an unseen power backing them up that the rulers did not recognize. It was Jehovah God, his Son, Christ Jesus, and a multitude of angels, and the holy spirit that God was sending to strengthen his earthly servants. These faithful Christians, “therefore, went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name. And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ.” Do you have that kind of faith? Would you listen to an angel of Jehovah and do what the apostles did? True Christians will!—Acts 5:41, 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What joy the apostles had because they listened to the angel! They moved out into greater fields of service in vindication of Jehovah’s name and word. They strengthened the growing congregation of God in their day. Eventually, these apostles along with many other faithful, tried followers moved out into other regions, not just among the Jews, but among the Gentiles. These others of every tribe and tongue and people were given the opportunity of learning the truth and “the sayings about this life” that Jesus had told his followers about. The apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, told of his keen interest in “the sayings about this life” when he gave them his wonderful argument in proof of the resurrection of the dead.—1 Cor. 15:1-57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christians will now imitate those apostles who did what God’s angel told them to do. Jehovah’s angels today are directing his people in his organization throughout the earth as these declare the message of everlasting good news. So take courage. Share in the preaching work. Do it with boldness, having confidence in God’s Word. “For he will give his own angels a command concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.” (Ps. 91:11) In proof of this Paul asks the question: “Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?” (Heb. 1:14) His question calls for the answer Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Are you, then, interested in salvation through Christ Jesus? Peter and John were and said: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.” (Acts 4:12) If you have the faith a Christian must have in Christ Jesus, then in order to succeed in this fast-fading system of things you will continue to pray to be “filled with the holy spirit” and as a result you will be “speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVE AND BOLDNESS LEAD TO LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that “there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved,” then you must certainly believe the words of Jesus and his apostles. Jesus said: “If you love me, you will observe my commandments.” (John 14:15) The logical conclusion, then, is as stated by Jesus: “He that has my commandments and observes them, that one is he who loves me. In turn he that loves me will be loved by my Father.” (John 14:21) So, when a disciple keeps Jesus’ commandments he shows love. But what do these commandments of Jesus involve? For one thing, Jesus said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28: 19, 20) For Jesus’ followers to convince people to become disciples of Jesus it would take some talking, preaching, persuasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was not only a matter of making disciples but there was Jesus’ instruction to teach the new disciples and show them how to observe all the things Jesus commanded. To travel, preach and teach, that is, put the truth in the other person’s mind, is a lot of work for any Christian. Have you tried it? Does the “church” you belong to urge you to do all that? Or is your religion more like the one described in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font7"> magazine of October 25, 1963, in its religious section on page 86? It makes this statement: “President [of the Disciples of Christ Church] Dr. Robert W. Burns of Atlanta warned that the flames of a faith built on evangelism seemed to be dying into embers. ‘Our evangelism has lagged because many of us lack a deep concern for the salvation of our neighbor’s soul,’ he said. ‘How long since you were the means through which God added a soul to the church? How long since you even tried?’ ” These are good questions for everyone claiming to be a Christian to ponder. Every person belonging to any religious organization of Christendom should examine himself. Why? Well, if you claim to be a Christian, do you “go,” “disciple,” “baptize” and “teach”? What proof do you have that you are a Christian if you do not preach and teach pure Christianity? When did you last try to persuade anyone to take up Christian activity, like preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to others? Or, when did you even direct someone’s attention to God’s written Word the Bible so that he could take a firm stand for right principles? But you say: ‘The way I live my moral life proves I am a Christian. I do not have to talk it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interestingly, “all the things I have commanded you” takes in the high moral standard of God too. Do you join in the spirit of this world, which revolts against the teachings of Christ on sex morality? Do you in your church close your eyes to adultery, fornication and sodomy by your members? Paul the Christian did not! He spoke out, saying: “You, the one preaching ‘Do not steal,’ do you steal? You, the one saying ‘Do not commit adultery,’ do you commit adultery?” After pointing out the “disgraceful sexual appetites” of both the males and females of his day, he said: “These know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death.” (Rom. 2:21, 22; 1:24-32) Practicing wrong morals surely will not get you life! Paul believed what Jesus said on morals and bad habits. Remember Jesus’ words, “From inside, out of the heart of men, injurious reasonings issue forth: fornications, thieveries, murders, adulteries, cov-etings, acts of wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, an envious eye, blasphemy, haughtiness, unreasonableness. All these wicked things issue forth from within and defile a man.”—Mark 7:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was with straightforward words that Jesus answered the scribes and Pharisees when they complained about Jesus’ disciples eating with unwashed hands. He reached into God’s written Word to reply authoritatively, saying: “Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.’ ” It is what is in a man’s heart that makes him what he is, for out of his heart a man speaks. If he is like the Pharisees, he has lost sight of the real issue and is not following God’s or Jesus’ commandments. (Mark 7:6) Jesus was preaching the truth and was against any sort of hypocritical practice. Which side are you on when it comes to morals in a so-called Christian community? Do you express yourself or just let people look at you and wonder what you do stand for? Do you have the love of neighbor and the boldness to stand up and talk for what Jesus said on moral issues? Do you agree that &quot;he that disregards me [Jesus] and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him”? Jesus said: “The word that I have spoken is what will judge him in the last day; because I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak. Also, I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore the things I speak, just as the Father has told me them, so I speak them.” (John 12:48-50) Think! Just when did you read and understand the full meaning of the words Jesus spoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is easy to see that a Christian cannot just arrive at his own conclusions and decide how he should live. He must take into account what is written in God’s Word. If he loves Jesus he must obey the commandments of Jesus Christ too. How strange it sounds to a Christian’s ears to hear a member of a modern-day “church” say: “Ever since the beginning, we’ve been scared to death that we’d arrive at a theology everyone would have to subscribe to.” So said industrialist J. Irwin Miller, a lay disciple and president of the National Council of Churches. “The heart of the movement is this great concern to preserve the freedom to arrive at one’s own conclusions.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span class="font7"> magazine, Oct. 25, 1963, page 86) Does he mean to say the people of his religion do not on every occasion want to agree with the conclusions of Jesus and God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The twelve apostles of Christ Jesus did not want or have twelve different conclusions when they expressed the teachings of Christ. There was only one conclusion at which to arrive. The truth! Why is it that today there are more than a thousand so-called Christian church organizations throughout the world? It is because they want to teach their own conclusions, present their own ideas, and not God’s or those of Jesus. Is there not just one faith, one baptism, one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Well, then, why not get back to simple Christianity and have real love for one another and get understanding of God? Because there are too many persons wanting their ‘own conclusion,’ not truth. Even within the many different religious denominations themselves the individuals do not love their neighbors as they do themselves. Did not Jesus say: “Just as I have loved you . . . you also love one another”? Yes! All true Christians must show love for Jehovah God and for God’s Son Christ Jesus. To try to help people, showing love by explaining the Bible so all persons will learn the truth in this day and age, takes boldness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PAVL’S EXAMPLE OF BOWNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul had that kind of boldness and showed love by the way he served his brothers. First of all, he was not afraid to preach. The Bible records that Paul was “walking in and out at Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord; and he was talking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews. But these made attempts to do away with him.” (Acts 9:28,29) Do you who claim to be Christians go in and out and about your city, discussing your faith with others? Jesus did. The apostles did. Early Christians did. When Paul was in Antioch, he did. He wanted to aid the “lost sheep” of the children of Israel to understand that the Word of God pointed to the promised Messiah, namely, Christ Jesus. On sabbath days Paul would go into the synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia, and the people of the city would gather together to hear the words of Jehovah. However, when the Jews caught sight of the crowds they were filled with jealousy and began blaspheming and contradicting the things that were spoken by Paul: “And so, talking with boldness, Paul and Barnabas said: ‘It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are thrusting it away from you and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations. In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, “I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the extremity of the earth.” ’ When those of the nations heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah, and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers. Furthermore, the word of Jehovah went on being carried throughout the whole country.” (Acts 13:44-49) That message that Paul spoke back there reached many of your ancestors by means of the Bible. But has it reached you? Or are you like many millions today, just born into your religion? Have you made a personal decision to be a footstep follower of Christ Jesus? If you have, can you endure what Paul did and keep going in the Christian way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just because Paul was preaching the word of God the people of the city raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them outside their boundaries. So what did these two men do? “These shook the dust off their feet against them and went to Iconium.” (Acts 13:51) Paul showed love for Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus, by boldly speaking to the Jews in the synagogue in Iconium. In this way Paul proved he was a Christian. He loved Jesus. He observed Jesus’ commandments. Paul made “disciples of people of all nations” and taught them to observe the things Jesus commanded all his followers to do. What is your method of preaching? Do you teach too? Do you uphold the real Christian standard for proper morals, not the watered-down kind? The teachings of Christ and his way of doing things are still right. Are yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do not think that all the people in Christendom are Christians. They could not be, because they do not show the love of Christ and keep his commandments. Be honest with yourself about the question. Do the people belonging to Christendom’s churches in all their various religious denominations really act like Christians? You can say, ‘They have a religion,’ but surely you cannot say they are walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. If the people were doing so, this system of things would be different. Christendom’s religious leaders do not want to follow Christ any more than the Jewish religious leaders of Paul’s day did. Take a firm stand for righteousness, no compromise, and speak up in behalf of your faith in Christ Jesus and the Kingdom of God and you can expect the same kind of treatment as Paul got at Iconium. Here “a violent attempt took place ... to treat them insolently and pelt them with stones.” When Paul and Barnabas were informed of what the people and rulers were going to do, they fled the city.—Acts 14:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On another occasion Paul was speaking in a synagogue in Ephesus and “he spoke with boldness for three months, giving talks and using persuasion concerning the kingdom of God.” When some began “speaking injuriously about The Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them, daily giving talks in the school auditorium of Tyrannus.” (Acts 19:8, 9) Paul truly was a Christian missionary. He went to places and did preaching. He showed love for his brothers and was bold in teaching all sorts of people the way to everlasting life. You will find that to be a real Christian you will have to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLDNESS IX DUB DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If anyone is going to lay hold on everlasting life, he must do the same thing that Jesus Christ, Peter, John, Paul and all the rest of the apostles and disciples of Christ did. They all boldly declared the good news of God’s kingdom. The modern-day witnesses of Jehovah are trying hard to do the work Jesus said must be done “for a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14) Despite the opposition that they meet up with, as related in the 1964 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font7"> they boldly move ahead. They must declare the “everlasting good news” in all the inhabited earth again and again. That is God’s will. (See Chart of Countries, page 32.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looking back, we see that the joy of Jehovah’s witnesses was great in the year 1963, because 1,040,836 different publishers were boldly preaching the message of God’s kingdom in 194 lands. These Christians were associated with 22,761 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. These men and women love to teach God’s Word and proved it by spending 151,251,242 hours going from house to house, conducting Bible studies and speaking from the public platform. They actually made 51,994,915 return visits on people who had shown interest in Christ’s message and wanted to know more about God’s promises. These millions of people called on did not come to Jehovah’s witnesses' Kingdom Halls, but the million Kingdom publishers went to the peoples’ homes. Quite a different method than Christendom uses, but the original one introduced by Jesus and his apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people ask: ‘Is Bible study waning?’ Not with Jehovah’s witnesses. The fact is that every week of the year Jehovah’s witnesses conducted 702,470 home Bible studies. Think of the time spent too in going to and from these Bible studies on the part of these Christians. Would you call that a demonstration of love? How many times has your clergyman visited you in your home in 1963?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This conducting of home Bible studies was not being carried on by just the presiding “minister” of Jehovah’s witnesses’ congregations, but this work was being done by those who make up the congregation. All witnesses of Jehovah are ordained Christian ministers. In the apostles’ days any dedicated, baptized man or woman was commanded to ‘go and disciple the people of all nations.’ There is no difference in Christian work today. Neither God’s Bible nor the commandments in it have changed. But people’s conclusions as to what Christian religion should be have changed. Why not make your religion like what Jesus taught his to be, Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to these 702,470 home Bible studies held in the private homes of people Jehovah’s Christian</span></p>

There are other weekly meetings too, such as the theocratic ministry school, a Bible school where Jehovah’s witnesses receive training to express themselves better. They have &quot;service meetings” each week, where they learn how to improve their house-to-house ministry. Then there is the weekly study of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and the congregation book study. All these meetings are Bible study meetings. Jehovah’s witnesses keep on preparing themselves so as to be better ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding thing about Jehovah’s witnesses is that they believe alike and preach the same things Jesus preached. They do not encourage conclusions of their own originality. God’s Word is their teacher. Who is man that he can determine by himself the way of everlasting life? He needs a guide. That guide is the written Word of God. Jesus said: &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) And where is the truth Jesus taught? In the Holy Bible! Study it with others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus they will dedicate their lives to the service of Jehovah and be baptized by total immersion in water. During the year 1963 Jehovah’s witnesses baptized 62,798 individuals from all nations, people and tongues. They not only baptized these individuals but they taught them to observe all the things Jesus commanded. These, too, became Christian ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To help people, in their preaching work Jehovah’s witnesses placed with the people many Bible-study aids in 162 different languages. In the year 1963 they distributed 4,221,772 Bibles and bound books and 14,805,483 booklets. One of the best ways to keep your faith strong is to read regularly the Scriptures and good publications on the Holy Bible. All of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world read the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines and so do millions of other persons. Jehovah’s witnesses obtained 1,433,542 new subscriptions for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine, printed in sixty-six languages, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine, printed in twenty-five languages. They also placed individual copies of these two journals to the total number of 116,845,928. What an aid these printed Bible sermons are to Jehovah’s witnesses! They cannot spend all their time in the homes of the people talking, but they can leave literature with them so that the people can read until the publishers of the good news can make a return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has its own printing plants where Bibles, books, booklets, tracts and magazines are printed. To meet the demand for Bible literature ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses, all volunteer workers, produced 6,722,239 Bibles and bound books, 26,057,581 booklets, 103,763,470 copies of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and 95,100,307 copies of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine. They also printed 487,116,545 handbills, tracts and letters, as well as other office supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The method Jehovah’s witnesses use to reach the people is exactly like the method employed by Christ Jesus and his disciples. They went preaching from house to house and publicly. Jehovah’s witnesses today do the same. Today, though, the printed page helps Christian witnesses of Jehovah to speed up their work. It is not just left to the memory of the person who has heard what is said about everlasting life, but leaving Bible literature helps him to learn the truth in his private study of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to attending meetings at Kingdom Halls regularly five times a week, and taking part in the discussions there, did you know that Jehovah’s witnesses spend about ten hours each month going from house to house preaching and teaching the good news of God’s kingdom? Some spend more time, others less. Many special representatives devote much more time to this ministry work each month. There are 7,475 special pioneers who go into territory where there are often no congregations and spend at least 150 hours a month preaching from house to house, conducting Bible studies and organizing new congregations. Then there is another group of 31,098 pioneers who devote approximately 100 hours each month to the field service. They work generally in large cities, but may choose any field territory that is not assigned to someone else, and in such they carry on their ministerial service under the supervision of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Society representatives called circuit and district servants visit all pioneers and congregations to give organizational assistance and Scriptural counsel. These spend one week with each congregation, helping with the local problems. There are 1,983 such circuit and district servants assigned to overseers’ duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ninety branch offices of the Watch Tower Society around the world supervise the work of the circuit and district servants. There are 1,461 dedicated ministers of God that live in what the Society calls Bethel homes attached to branch offices. The branch office staff is keenly interested in the activity of all pioneers and congregations, and these all receive uniform instructions every month from the branch office under which they serve. This develops unity, oneness of thought and action, because all the instructions sent out are based on the Word of God. All the activity performed by Jehovah’s witnesses conforms to the principles of truth and righteousness and results in a showing of love by these witnesses toward their neighbors. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere really feel the urgency of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Through this kind of organization much is accomplished worldwide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">There is one day in the year that Jehovah’s witnesses commemorate, that is, the day of Christ’s death. That day, Nisan 14 according to the Jewish calendar, Jesus commanded to be remembered because of its significance. Last year Nisan 14 began on the evening of April 8, 1963, and there were 1,693,752 witnesses of Jehovah and persons of goodwill assembled in Kingdom Halls around the world to celebrate this occasion with gladness because they rejoiced that Christ Jesus died according to the will of God in their behalf. Of this number, 12,292 professed to be of the remnant of the body of Christ, anointed by holy spirit to be joint heirs with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory, and they anticipate being part of the bride of Christ. The hope of all the rest assembled that night is everlasting life in a new system of things here upon the earth along with all those dead ones who loved righteousness and showed it by their works too. These will be resurrected in God’s due time during the one-thousand-year reign of Christ. It was Jesus who said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28,29) What a day or period of time that will be! What love one can show now to tell such truths to mankind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The strong sense of responsibility Jehovah’s witnesses have causes them to continue to preach this good news about the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus and the ransom sacrifice that he provided. They believe in God’s kingdom as mankind’s only hope. They not only pray for this kingdom to come but work for it now. Have you ever earnestly prayed the Lord’s prayer, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth”? (Matt. 6:9, 10) If you have, work for it too by being a real Christian minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To do this great work of declaring the “everlasting good news” that Jehovah’s witnesses feel they must perform requires real love on their part for their fel-iowman of every nation, tribe, tongue and people. But to do this they must first of all have love for their Father in heaven. Jehovah’s witnesses love Christ Jesus too and they know they are his disciples. They are truly Jehovah’s Christian witnesses because they love not only Jehovah, but his Son, Christ Jesus, and they are doing the will of God and following the commandments of Christ. Doing this in a world with the spirit it has against truth certainly takes love and boldness, but it certainly will lead to life and eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even with all the teachings of the Bible that Jehovah’s witnesses carry on, some religious organizations of the world today claim that the witnesses are not Christians, but that is because the religious organizations are jealous, even as were the Jewish priests. Jehovah’s witnesses are walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, and the false religionists know it! Jesus said: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:34, 35) This love Jehovah’s witnesses do have and they proved it again in their Around-the-World Assembly in the summer of 1963. They must maintain that love even while in this present evil system of things in order to receive the blessing of Jehovah God and everlasting life. If you have the love and the boldness of the early Christians, then get out of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, and serve Jehovah God and obey the commandments of Christ Jesus with Jehovah’s witnesses and have their joy in preaching the “everlasting good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“EVERLASTING GOOD NEWS” ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The outstanding event in the history of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania during the year 1963 was the worldwide assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, which was called “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This Around-the-World Convention began on June 30 and ended September 8, 1963. It was a continuous assembly of seventy-one days. Those dedicated servants of Jehovah God who kept on going from one assembly to another during those seventy-one days, followed by the trip home, traveled all the way around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As far back as June of 1960 the president of the Society was working on the details of this Around-the-World Assembly, which culminated in a grand climax on September 8, 1963, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, when 118,447 packed out and overflowed that huge stadium. The efforts that went into making this great assembly a success required, first of all, the blessing of Jehovah and his direction. Jehovah’s witnesses remembered this assembly in their prayers daily, having in mind the grand witness to be given to the honor of Jehovah’s name. The branch offices in twenty-two places cooperated fully with the office of the president in working out all the problems pertaining to the convention location, housing delegates, transportation and arranging for world travelers to share in the field service and seeing points of interest, especially those pertaining to religion. Due to the splendid cooperation of all the brothers and the diligent effort put forth by all the branch offices of the Society the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly proved to be a huge success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Unless a person shared in all the work that went into arranging this Around-the-World Assembly it would be difficult to comprehend the many details that had to be cared for and the great amount of time and effort that went into making the arrangements. The president of the Society made a preliminary trip around the world in December, 1962, visiting all but four of the convention branches to work out the final details with the branch servants and their assistants. The 583 witnesses of Jehovah who made the trip around the world were amazed at the smooth-operating organization that had been set up. The more than a half million people who attended the convention at the assembly cities around the world were grateful for all the preparations made in their behalf, and especially for the spiritual food that was provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROGRAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The program was very thoughtfully worked out and first presented in the County Stadium baseball park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America. The same spiritual, upbuilding Bible information was presented during ten weeks in more than thirty languages. Where required, the lectures of President N. H. Knorr, Vice-President F. W. Franz and Secretary-Treasurer G. Suiter were all translated as they traveled around the world. Outlines were furnished to all other speakers on the programs so that they could present the same theme and make the principal points in each language as presented at the original assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many very interesting Bible prophecies, especially those in Revelation, were brought to the attention of Jehovah’s witnesses in all the twenty-four cities visited, as well as other vital Bible information that has been made clear in these latter days. It could easily be seen that Jehovah had a great work to be done in connection with the preaching of the “everlasting good news” and that all persons dedicated to Jehovah God had a great obligation resting upon them to repeat the message that the angel flying in midheaven had given for all the nations, tribes, tongues and peoples to hear. It was readily seen that those having faith in Jehovah God would come to fear him and give him glory, and that in these days a tremendous witness must be given concerning God’s kingdom even to the ends of the earth. This witness is necessary so that all hearing the message can have the opportunity to worship the one true God, Jehovah, who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. A powerful message was declared regarding Babylon the Great. It was pointed out that the prophecy of Revelation 14:8 and other prophecies throughout the whole Bible were being fulfilled concerning the world empire of false religion. Strong emphasis was used to show that all persons of goodwill must flee from this world empire of false religion, withdraw every bit of support and seek safety in Jehovah’s organization in order to escape the plagues poured out by the seven angels mentioned in Revelation, beginning in chapter fifteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In complete support of the message that was being declared throughout the convention program concerning Babylon the Great, representative of the world empire of false religion, was the release of the new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </span><span class="font7">This was enthusiastically received by Jehovah’s witnesses around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was only one part of the convention that was very thrilling. There were many other features that aroused intense interest. Much was said on the responsibility of overseers and the work of the principal ministerial servant in each congregation, as he deals with the congregation from the platform and behind the scenes, as it were. It was forcefully shown how he must show real interest in every individual and how he must render compassionate care, even as a shepherd cares for his flock of sheep. Special meetings were held in connection with the circuit and district servants and their activities in the congregations. Special pioneers and other pioneers also received instructive information. Missionary meetings were arranged for in every city and much helpful information was presented from the platform that was an aid to all overseers and special representatives, as well as the whole congregation of God. What was beneficial to one was certainly beneficial to another because every talk was based on Bible teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much was said about the conduct of the world and how Jehovah’s witnesses could not have the spirit of this world, but must produce the fruits of the spirit. Right conduct could best be attained and maintained by constant study of the Scriptures and association with God’s dedicated people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible was certainly given due attention throughout the entire convention in each country. It was a joy to see so many people in the convention audiences opening their Bibles when citations of scripture were given so that they could follow along with the speaker to see exactly what he had to say, and to make notes so that they could review the subject later. Persons dedicated to Jehovah God are so different in their thinking and actions from persons of this old world, and they must be so. They have to exhibit the fruits of the spirit, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness and self-control, not only to those dedicated to God and in Jehovah’s visible organization today, but to all persons throughout the earth. They must be proclaimers of the “everlasting good news” of the Kingdom and of the judgments of God that he will bring against false religion, politics and those harming the people of the earth. Everything stated by all the speakers, regardless of language, had the backing of the Bible. So the Bible did indeed receive the consideration that is due this book inspired by Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly three English editions of the Holy Bible were released to the conventioners, namely, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> in deluxe form, in a pocket edition and in large type with footnotes, cross-references and appendices. Additionally, there were six foreign-language Greek Scripture editions of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> released. This brought tremendous joy and satisfaction to the witnesses of Jehovah speaking French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Italian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were other very instructive meetings and demonstrations, one of which featured a convention release entitled “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” This book will be used after January 1, 1964, in the theocratic ministry school in English-speaking congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One highlight of these assemblies around the world not to be overlooked was the adoption of the powerful resolution that firmly declared that Jehovah’s witnesses would remain neutral toward all types of human government and that together they would press forward declaring the “everlasting good news” of Jehovah’s righteous kingdom. The world around, this resolution was enthusiastically adopted by Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention. This was indeed a great testimony to the unity of Jehovah’s people no matter where they may be located on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We could go on and on relating to you, the reader, the details on the various lectures and themes developed by the speakers, but much of this information will appear in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine so that we can all give it very careful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MILWAUKEE, U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another thing that made this convention most unusual was its around-the-world feature, starting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 30 and going eastward around the world. The first assembly was eight days long, and everything just mentioned happened there and a lot more. There was a baptism service at which time 905 persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God. On the final Sunday of the Milwaukee assembly 57,055 gathered together to hear the public address “When God Is King over AU the Earth.” As that assembly was drawing to a close, with its representatives from twenty-three different countries, the New York assembly in Yankee Stadium was beginning, namely, on July 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW YORK, U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York assembly opened with 67,266 in attendance. The seven days that followed moved much too fast. There were so many people to see and things to do. Thousands of brothers visited the Society’s Bethel home and printing plant. Additionally, a great crowd witnessed the tremendous baptism of 2,251 in the waters at Orchard Beach. Representatives from eighty-nine countries were in attendance at this second convention. Then there was that wonderful meeting together of all the missionaries present from sixty different countries. This was held in the Bethel dining room, where 465 Gilead School graduates gathered together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As each day of these conventions passed it seemed that the joy and enthusiasm of the crowd increased. One could not contain all the blessings and the happiness expressed in such abundance. We were to realize that this same spirit moved right around the world with Jehovah’s people. In spite of a pouring rain the public meeting attendance of 107,483 climaxed the New York assembly when all heard the lecture “When God Is King over AU the Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One who thinks he is setting a fast pace would do well to consider for a moment the pace that the around-the-world travelers set in meeting the schedule for assemblies around this globe. The trip that began for many with the New York convention was now to take them around the world in eight weeks. The 583 travelers who got into this race with time found that they were going to be stopping just long enough in various cities to get acquainted with some local Witnesses, see new faces, new lands, new ways of life and then just as they were feeling right at home they would be hustled on their way to the next stop. The amazing thing seemed to be that the longer they kept going the greater were their energy and enthusiasm. Quite a number of the around-the-world travelers were over seventy years of age. Some were even on crutches. This made some of the younger ones who felt the pace was too fast a bit ashamed of themselves for not being able to keep up with all there was to do. In a number of instances youth did not show the stamina and surely not the appreciation for this grand privilege of visiting their brothers around the world. The older folks had earned the right to make this trip through the saving of their money and by working hard during their life. Because of their many years in the truth they had a deep appreciation of all the things they saw and heal’d on this trip around the world. A few of the young folks who were sent around the world by their parents, who thought it would do them a lot of good, looked at it as a pleasure trip rather than a service privilege. While all who went around the world were dedicated to the service of God, there certainly was a difference in maturity and appreciation. By far the great majority had the real appreciation and returned to their homes overflowing with joy at having had the opportunity of visiting with their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To tell anyone all that really happened on this around-the-world trip an individual would have to write a book. This the Society has done, and has published a 224-page brochure, well illustrated, called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Report on “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font7"> For details and pictures read that publication. But here is a brief report of a very hurried trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The around-the-world travelers in London had a grand time in field service and enjoyed their association with the British brothers at Twickenham Stadium and had the opportunity of feasting their eyes on one of the most beautiful English gardens in full bloom during all the sessions. The colors and arrangements, along with a small thatched-roof bungalow, added warmth to the entire setting. The tour to Watch Tower House, the British Bethel Home and printing plant, was greatly appreciated, as well as the opportunity to view many interesting historical Bible things in the London Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Stockholm convention was in session simultaneously with the London assembly July 14-21. This assembly was held in Fotbollstadion at Rasunda, a part of Greater Stockholm. Interestingly, all the European conventions had tent camps, but the Swedish one was unique because of its location, along a main highway, easily seen from the road and in the center of a great racetrack. Brothers from four nations—Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark—camped there in their colorful tents. It was an international New World campsite complete with its modern store, self-servicestyle. Walking through a tent camp of Jehovah’s witnesses, one could feel Jehovah’s spirit and the love on the part of all the campers. Most of the campers had never met their neighbors until they pitched their tent next to them, but as soon as one said “Hello, brother,” one had New World living at least for eight days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Stockholm there was a big translation problem. While in New York there was a Spanish-speaking assembly in a separate building, in Stockholm all four languages, Finnish, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, were spoken simultaneously in the same stadium to a big daily crowd, the peak attendance being 25,160 at Sunday’s public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was pleasant to sit in the huge stadium in Stockholm and to see the large four-leaf-clover-shaped platform. Sometimes, when demonstrations were going on, you would see about one hundred people on the four platforms, but you would only hear what was going on in one language, the language serving the section in which you were sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Sweden the Society had just finished a new addition to its branch office at Jakobsberg. All who toured the Society’s property were delighted to see the improvements made there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MUNICH, GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Munich, Germany, presented its problems. For months previous to the convention, the brothers were building their own stadium. They constructed a huge horseshoelike seating area and a large 250-foot-long platform at the open end. The German-speaking brothers came from Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland as well as West Germany. Other delegates swelled the number of different countries represented to thirty-five. The large fairgrounds adjoining the Theresienwiese (Theresien Meadows) was also used. A large theater accommodated the French-speaking brothers from France and Belgium. Another great hall in the fairgrounds was decorated for the brothers of the Netherlands to use. All assembly places were tied together by one grand sound system so that lectures given on the main platform in English could be heard everywhere, and then they would be translated into the German, French and Dutch languages. The organization required to feed, house and care for such a large convention was tremendous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The German brothers arranged some excellent bus tours. The field service work in Munich and seeing part of the city were most enjoyable the first morning for the world travelers. One they will never forget was the tour to Dachau, one of Hitler’s concentration camps. You could feel the oppression, hatred, inquisition, yes, the insanity of the rulers. Walking down the main parade street of Dachau, where the Gestapo in Hitler’s day ruled with an iron heel, our German brothers would point out different places of interest. “That barracks over there is where hundreds of us lived. The one next to it too, No. 17, was a crowded place, but all brothers. Here is where we would have to stand in the cold of winter. There is where we used to go to eat, but there was not much food.” Then, thinking about the horror of it all, the suffering, the integrity, the faithfulness of our brothers, we walked on together to another section of this camp, to where the killing took place, the gallows, the delousing chambers, as they called them, the huge furnaces where they would throw the dead bodies and they would be burned to a crisp, to ashes. With these ashes they could fertilize the ground or they buried them. What torture to the ones living there! When would their turn come? How far would rulers go to break man’s integrity? How long can faithful servants of God undergo such treatment? The answers were plainly written there in Dachau. Until death!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mark for Earnest Bible Students, Jehovah’s witnesses, could be seen in Dachau. Their “purple triangular symbol” was plainly in evidence. The papers that Hitler tried to make Jehovah’s witnesses sign in renouncing their faith in Jehovah God and their association with Jehovah’s witnesses were on display. The story is there to be seen by all the world that visits this concentration campsite. The allied governments have made this place a memorial to those who suffered and died to show the German people and everyone visiting the country what Hitler, along with his depraved followers, did. It certainly makes you think of what God’s Word says on matters of worship. For example, Revelation 14:9, 10 says: “If anyone worships the wild beast ... he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God.” We know that different beasts mentioned in the Word of God have been representative of different nations. The image of the wild beast is representative of the United Nations. How anyone could come to worship a nation, or a wild beast, after seeing what the beastly nations do to Christians is hard to comprehend. It was worth seeing Dachau. It made an impression upon the mind that will not be quickly forgotten. It was a sight to remember and causes one to resolve with the help of Jehovah always to walk in integrity, never shrinking back because of any persecution. The words “Be faithful even to death” ring clearly in your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MILAN, ITALY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now let us hurry on to Milan, Italy, where the huge Velodromo Vigorelli stadium was obtained. Not only were brothers here from Italy, France and Switzerland, but also a large delegation came from Spain and Portugal. What a joyful crowd assembled in Milan! These were a spirited people by nature. The Latins are excitable. It was a pleasure to be in their midst and to feel their joy and excitement when receiving new releases, especially the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font7"> in Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese. There were great shouts for joy on receiving the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> in their own language. The eight-day program was just as thrilling and informative as that of all the other conventions. By this time not only were the 583 world travelers in Milan, but now many others who had planned to go as far as Palestine were meeting up with the world travelers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the airlines for days were carrying our brothers over the toe of the foot in the boot of Italy. We saw the island of Sicily to the west, then across the Peloponnesus, the Aegean Sea, landing at Athens Airport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ATHENS, GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers were at the airport to meet us, just like it was done in every other country. However, our Greek brothers had a look of disappointment on their faces, not because we had arrived but because there was not to be an assembly in the Panathinaikos Athletikos Omilos. The archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church had shown the Greek government and the prime minister who was “boss” of that country. He had threatened a march on Athens by the Greek Orthodox Church members if the meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses was not forbidden. So everyone, from the prime minister on down, kowtowed to the orders of the archbishop, Chrysostomos, and the meeting was banned. Already a great witness had been given from one end of the country to the other by the publicity in the newspapers. People were inquiring everywhere why there was all this uproar because Jehovah’s witnesses wanted to meet together. Numerous opportunities of preaching the good news of the Kingdom were now opening up because of this persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This kind of treatment was not new to Jehovah’s witnesses. The clergy there have been fighting the work of God’s people for decades. But, as this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font7">shows, there has been a fine increase in the work in Greece during the past year, and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and if it be according to his will, there will be an even greater increase next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a real pleasure for the president of the Society to be able to speak to all the circuit and district servants. They were given information on the assemblies that had been held up to that point. They were told how the Resolution would be read for adopting in all the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece and how the main talks would be delivered in every congregation in a short time. This, of course, is all history now and has been accomplished without difficulty. There were 9,917 of our brothers in Greece who joined in adopting the Resolution in home meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time of the world travelers was well spent in Greece though. Their minds were constantly being drawn to God’s Word by their trip to Corinth, which Paul visited many centuries previously, and one could recall many of the things about which Paul wrote. In Athens we had the opportunity of visiting Mars Hill, where Paul made his famous speech about the “unknown God.” At the same time we visited the Acropolis and saw the places where there were so many different gods, all made of marble and without life and words of counsel. What a difference in religions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During our stay in Greece there were many opportunities to talk with the Greek brothers. We were encouraged by them and feel we brought comfort and joy to our fellow workers in Greece. We visited with missionaries and did touring with some of them. Even though the Greek brothers, and all of us for that matter, were disappointed in not having the assembly for one day, still we left our brothers in Greece in good spirits and thankful for the association that all had together for the spiritual upbuilding of one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BEIRUT, LEBANON</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Beirut, Lebanon, we did not expect to have any large assembly. However, arrangements were made to visit the various Kingdom Halls in Beirut and Tripoli, and so, in effect, during the many days that the travelers were there our brothers received just as much information as many of the brothers at future conventions would receive on the around-the-world assembly. The brothers got all the high points of the talks. Later on, after we had gone, they had the baptismal service and the public meeting. We later learned that 31 were immersed and 914 attended the public talk. We did have fellowship with many of the Lebanese brothers and sisters on trips to the cedars of Lebanon and the ruins of Baalbek. Traveling by car over the beautiful mountains of Lebanon and down to the Bekaa Plain, or Rift Valley, proved to be an unforgettable trip. Now we were in the “Holy Land” once ruled by David and Solomon. But our minds went much farther back. It was down through this valley coming from the north that Abraham with his great herds of cattle and attendants traveled. It seemed to us that the changes in the way of life since Abraham’s time were not too great. We saw Bedouins living in tents made of goat’s hair, and we saw camels traveling down the roads loaded with their packs. It took us away, away back in history. Nothing modern for these particular folks!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Northward we went through this very beautiful fertile plain between the two great mountain ranges of Lebanon, arriving at Baalbek. We saw the temple of Jupiter, the temple of Bacchus and the temple of Venus. The goings-on in these temples as recorded is sordid history. What debauchery these religious, drunken orgies brought to the human family! What a contrast between the lives of the worshipers of false gods and the way Jehovah has directed his people to walk, in righteousness! It was an education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there were the great cedars of Lebanon to see and Byblos on the seacoast of the Mediterranean. The land is full of ancient history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were now over 1,100 of Jehovah’s witnesses who came to Beirut on their way to Jerusalem in Jordan. Congregation publishers, overseers, missionaries, pioneers, the branch organization, all of them cooperated and worked day and night to help the visitors on their journey. This kind of service was gladly given around the world by all the local publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JERUSALEM, JORDAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next stop—Jerusalem! This was the place all were keenly interested in and they wanted to take full advantage of the time. The Society arranged to take all the visitors on six different tours in the three days they were there. They could take others if they desired and these were also described for the travelers. One tour took us to the south of Jerusalem to the city of Hebron, claimed to be one of the most ancient cities in the world. Here we were actually in one of the old cities of refuge. Here David was first crowned king of Israel. Here Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah in which to bury his wife Sarah. It is claimed that he too is buried there along with Isaac, Jacob and Leah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All these places of great prominence in the Bible are now inside a large mosque, a religious place of worship for the Moslems, or else the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox or some other religious system has built churches over what they call sacred places. We also saw a very old oak tree, which is called the Oak of Mamre, the general location where the angel appeared to Abraham to inform him that he would be the father of a son in his old age. We passed the place where Philip baptized the Ethiopian eunuch. Women were busy there filling jars of water to carry to their homes. Springs and pools of water are gathering places for the women. They do not have running water in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We see some fine grape vineyards and visit the pools of Solomon. Of course, they have been reconstructed or repaired but are still used for water storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bethlehem holds real interest, for here it was that Jesus was born. However, the Church of the Nativity takes away all the humbleness and lowliness that would be found in a stable where animals would be bedded down. The incense, the colored lights, candles, tapestry, the decoration, all take away from the true setting. Then you hear the guide say that on Christmas Day the place is packed out and the people of different religions get into arguments and shove and push one another. Before their services are over the police have to be called in to calm down the crowds. This is “modern Christianity,” their Christmas spirit! Really it is Babylon’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The air is cleaner, the sun brighter, as we ride along the dusty roads passing the field that was said to have belonged to Boaz. That brings to mind the story of Naomi and Ruth. Not too far from this location are the Shepherds’ Fields. This is where the shepherds saw the angel and heard the singing of the great heavenly host at the announcement of the birth of Christ. All of this seems more real, for you certainly can imagine the shepherds with their flocks in the fields just outside the city of Bethlehem within easy walking distance of the place where Jesus was born in the manger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Time goes fast as the tours continue to the Kidron Valley and the pools of Siloam, where you see people bathing themselves and also taking their sheep down steep stairs to wash them in water. There is still a good flow of water from the spring of Gihon and through the canal cut by Hezekiah. Now when we read the Bible we can see these things as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Going farther down the Kidron Valley you come to the junction of the Valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna. It was somewhere near here, so tradition has it, that children were offered alive in sacrifice to the god Molech. Not too far away we see the Potter’s Field, the “field of blood.” It was bought for thirty pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Returning we see the tomb of Absalom and get a good view of the hillside of the Mount of Olives. We walk around Gethsemane, and the very, very old olive trees are still there on the side of the Mount of Olives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One evening we traveled to Amman, going through Bethany, down into the deep Jordan Valley, just a little north of the Dead Sea. The sun is setting and the hills of Judea throw long shadows, the Mountains of Moab reflecting the soft light of the sun to give off purple hues. The sunlight still glistens on the peak of Mount Nebo where Moses once stood and at the age of 120 years and with eyes that had not grown dim saw the Promised Land. What a view he had then, but we were deep in the valley below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Traveling through desert country, we reach Amman and have a joyful time with our brothers in their own Kingdom Hall. We travel back that same evening in the light of a full moon and we think of how it must have been in the days when there were no electric lights and people used only their little olive-oil lamps. But on this moonlit night without the smog of the big cities, what a beautiful place to meditate and consider the heavens and the handiwork of the Creator Jehovah God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up early and up to the top of the Mount of Olives, we viewed the city of Jerusalem to the west and the temple area. On that road to the left very likely Jesus rode on an ass in his triumphal ride into Jerusalem, with people spreading palm branches and hailing him. We too go right into the city of Jerusalem. We enter through Stephen’s Gate. We see excavations of the Pool of Bethesda. There is one point of interest after another to be seen. Finally, we reach the temple area where the Moslem Dome of the Rock holds the prominent position. Here used to stand the glorious temple of Solomon and the great temple of Herod in the days of Jesus. What a commanding view you get of the land roundabout! Inside the Moslem temple, which is the second most sacred spot in the Islam religion, we see the great rock. It was up to this rock that Abraham brought his son, Isaac, and it was here where the altar of the temple of Solomon was located. It was in this great temple area where, years before Solomon’s time, there was a threshing floor. While in Lebanon we had seen such threshing and winnowing floors in full operation. King David purchased this one so that the area could be used for the building of a house of worship. Bible history flies through your mind. You cover ground at such </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> rapid pace that words cannot be spoken fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now down to the weeping wall! On through the very narrow streets, passing jackasses loaded down with saddlebags, people in their many different costumes, shops and more shops. It seems that the streets get more narrow, or that the things that were inside the shops are now outside crowding the walkway. There is just a narrow passageway for people to move through. You get the smell of food, of shoes, spices, people. This is Jerusalem, the old city! Walking out of the Damascus Gate, we take a deep breath and stroll through a more modern part of the city outside the wall and to a place called the Garden Tomb. This at least looks more authentic than the place of the staking, burial and resurrection of Jesus inside a great church structure and inside the city’s wall of today. This is outside in the open, with trees all around, a beautiful garden, the sky above. It looks like someone’s private burial place in his own garden. We listened to the guide’s explanation. Yes, here you can imagine Jesus wrapped in white cloth and anointed with oils for burial and put into a tomb hewed out of rock. You can very easily imagine the guard stationed in front of the rolling stone that would have sealed the burial place. All of this could be like the burial and resurrection place of Jesus. Not too far away is the Place of the Skull, Golgotha. As we look at the hillside we can see the two great caves that would look like two eyes and protruding rocks for the position of the nose, and the crevices in the rocks below that would look like a small mouth. Yes, it could be the Place of the Skull, and above it Jesus, the Savior of the world, could have been impaled and could have been brought down from the torture stake and wrapped and prepared for burial not too far away in this garden tomb. It looks like a garden with its winepress for treading out grapes. You enjoy yourself there because it makes you think of spiritual things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our next visit is to the city of Jericho. From here we see the mountain of temptation where Jesus went after his baptism and in the far distance to the east the mountains of Moab and the mountain of Nebo that Moses was on top of centuries ago. We can imagine the millions of Israelites crossing the Jordan and later marching around Jericho. Then we go to the Jordan River, the same river where Jesus was baptized. We see the location where tradition has it his baptism took place. This looks real. It is out in the open and there seems to have been little change over the centuries. Trees and growing plants fill the banks of the river. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font7"> could be that John the Baptist walked through all this area preaching and then Jesus came to him and was baptized. It is a hot afternoon and we are about 1,300 feet below sea level—as we get to the Dead Sea. Then we travel up the mountainside to see the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. What barrenness! What dryness! What heat! There you see the caves. Some of the brothers go into them. Then you reflect on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> and think how the ancient Isaiah manuscript found here was consulted by the New World Bible Translation Committee in the producing of this very fine translation of God’s Word. Still, after all these centuries of these scrolls being preserved and now being examined, no particular changes were made necessary in translating the Hebrew text. No new truths result from these finds, but what was found certainly substantiates that God has preserved the authentic Holy Scriptures. How good it was that the New World Bible Translation Committee could have the benefit of the Isaiah scroll and other portions of the manuscripts that were found. Being here brings you closer to the reality of the day and the things that God’s people are working with, and you marvel at the preservation of manuscripts going back two thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, wringing wet with perspiration, you are glad to return to the hotel, get a cool refreshing bath, go up on the roof of the hotel for some breeze and to watch the full moon come up over the Mount of Olives. Not too many blocks away Jesus with his faithful disciples celebrated the Memorial under the same moon, not only five months earlier but centuries ago. The full moon in Jerusalem is beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the morning we drive to Samaria, and one always wonders just what Shiloh looked like where the Ark of the Covenant was kept for 350 years and where Samuel served. We see Shiloh on the way. Then we come to the point where the guide says this is the border between Judah and the ten tribes of Israel. What a deep valley it turns out to be! Then we drive along the southern slope of Mount Gerizim down to Jacob’s well, the same place where Jesus came and talked with the Samaritan woman. We drink some of this good water, but we could not have been as thirsty as Jesus was. We had been riding in a car, and he had walked great distances. The water was tasty, fresh and something to be enjoyed. This was really Jacob’s well where the Samaritan woman from Sychar came to draw water and where Jesus spoke to her. What a favored woman!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just ahead of us is Mount Ebal. We drive between the mountains of Gerizim and Ebal and on north to Samaria. It is beautiful land. There are olive trees on the hillside and well-cultivated valleys. When we get up on the high hills where Samaria came to be the capital of the ten-tribe kingdom, we stop at what they claim was the summer palace of Herod Antipas. Tradition has it that here Salome danced for the head of John the Baptist. Not too far away, just a short walk, are the remains of King Ahab’s palace. You can climb around these ruins and see the beautiful valley on both sides of the mountain. You ask yourself the question, “Why, with all this loveliness and pleasantness, should King Ahab want Naboth’s vineyard?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the way back we travel the road to Emmaus and then on to Gibeon. It can easily be seen why the Gibeonites were called drawers of water as that was their assigned work given them by Joshua, but they certainly had deep wells and large storage places in their own strongly walled city. These Gibeonites that wanted to save their lives did not have to walk far to meet Joshua. This became so real to us when we saw the locations of Gibeon and Ai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This trip to Palestine made the Bible spring to life, and all around you you felt things were happening. These three days passed much too quickly. We met with the brothers in Amman and Ramallah, spoke to the missionaries in Jordan, met Jehovah’s witnesses from somewhere at every turn in the road. It was good to visit the Holy Land during the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, but we fly to Beirut again and catch our plane to New Delhi, India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW DELHI, INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Flying all night did not dampen the zeal of the arriving delegates in New Delhi, arriving at 6:30 a.m. Indian time. We were greeted by the branch servant, along with many others. Three lovely sisters in native saris put leis around the necks of the travelers. We hurried off to the hotel because at 8:30 that morning we must be in a bus heading for the field service. What experiences!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Things are so different in India. People welcome you into their homes but the local missionary does not need to help you with the language; so many people in New Delhi speak English. Being invited into the homes, you have difficulty taking your eyes off the Hindus, the women with their colorful saris, wearing rings on their toes and fingers and sometimes in their noses. They love bracelets too. Some have precious jewels in settings pierced in the side of their nose and marks on their forehead, red or black, and sometimes yellow. With all these interesting distractions before you, you must concentrate on what you are going to say or get lost in wonderment. You know you are there to preach the everlasting good news. Many Indians listen to the message and take literature. To hear the world travelers talk, this is the finest territory they have ever worked in. A tour to the Qutb Minar follows field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now to the first convention session at the Vigyan Bhavan, a beautiful hall. What a delightful sight! All your brothers and sisters sitting there, a great many in white but others in colored saris. The talks are translated into Kanarese, Marathi, Urdu, Tamil and Malayalam, but the majority do not need the earphones to tune in their own tongue, for they understand English. Time is flying by. There are so many meetings to attend, people to meet, missionaries to talk to, another tour. Before you leave you have seen India’s greatest wealth and its poverty. There are some sacred cows, and so skinny we wonder why the worshipers of them do not feed their gods better. In one of the temples the swastika stands out prominently. You remember that you saw that same symbol, or one very much like it in Baalbek, and it was the same symbol that Hitler used for his emblem, and that swastika sign came from his Catholic school. How strange! Or, is it? Is it not religion coming down from Babylon on through the ages to modem times, still a part of the world empire of false religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this assembly too the officers of the Society, Brothers Knorr, Franz and Suiter, had the joy of speaking to their Indian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RANGOON, BURMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But we must be on our way again, this time to Rangoon, Burma, where the City Hall was obtained for the assembly. It is right in the heart of Rangoon. Brother Knorr, being delayed due to plane travel, arrived just a few minutes before he was scheduled to give his talk. What a pleasure to be associated with the delightful Burmese brothers and sisters and to observe their happiness in meeting with so many brothers from outside Burma! This was a new experience for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was not advisable to do house-to-house work here as the traveling representatives had only a transit visa, but we could enjoy the fellowship and the convention. We were able to visit some of the interesting Buddhist temples, particularly the Shwe Dagon Pagoda. This pagoda is 326 feet high and is covered with gold leaf worth two and a half million dollars. They claim that the very top of this structure, which is a ten-inch spherical globe of gold, is covered with diamonds and precious stones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was the monsoon season and one gets quite wet walking around among the hundreds of shrines at the base of this great pagoda. Everyone had to check his shoes and socks in the bus, so it was a new experience to go sloshing around on the well-washed pavement. How interesting to see a Buddhist purchasing “holy water” and have priests pour this “holy water” over certain images. This, we understood, was to wash away the sins of the one who bought the “holy water” for the priest to use in his behalf. The use of candles, incense, “holy water,” bells, beads and the shaved heads of the priests and nuns all brought to mind the very likeness of the Buddhist religion to the Roman Catholic religion. Certainly it was a far cry from the simplicity of worship that Christ Jesus introduced to his faithful followers. Christendom, centuries later, sanctified these Buddhist things into its way of worship, all of them pagan practices and beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The assembly in Burma was the largest they have ever had, and were the brothers pleased with 603 at the public talk! Sixteen were baptized. What a pleasure it was too to meet with all the missionaries, eighteen in number, at a special meeting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BANGKOK, THAILAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bangkok, Thailand, was the next stop. It is called the Venice of the East. The “Everlasting Good News” Assembly was held in the Lumpini Hall, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> delightful place open on three sides, but well sheltered from the rain. Again the brothers had the unique experience of going from house to house, now taking off their shoes when they entered the homes and listening to their fellow-Witness guides speak Thai. The Witnesses soon found that the local children wanted to help them. A dozen or so would follow along from house to house, hearing the Witnesses present literature. Often the children would be telling the householder why the Witness was at the door before ever the Witness had a chance to speak. Of course, when anyone was invited inside he could go ahead with his sermon without the aid of the children. Everyone enjoyed the field service and the tour that went with it. They saw some interesting landmarks in the city of Bangkok. The second morning, with no sessions in progress, the brothers were taken on a tour of the river to the floating market. This was an eye-opener. Life on the river kept one busy turning his neck from side to side, and even then we did not see it all. There were people bathing in the river, brushing their teeth with the river water, dipping up water for cooking purposes and using the same river for their toilet. Women in small boats were selling fruits, vegetables and flowers. There was a Buddhist monk in his orangecolored robe paddling his boat up the river making his collections of rice and other foods for the day. Look at that floating coffee shop and there a freshvegetable grocery store. A woman tied up alongside our boat to sell us bananas. If you think the streets in a modern American city are busy you ought to try rowing a boat through this traffic. All the Thai people living along the river front do their purchasing of supplies from the river side of the house, not from the land side. Stops are made at a silk mill, at the Temple of the Dawn, at the king’s barges covered with gold leaf. You really get close to the people on the river tour and learn their way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In contrast, the following morning the tour took us to the king’s palace, and what a grand palace it is! For magnificence and splendor it is unsurpassed in the East. We also saw the temple of the Emerald Buddha. We observed the form of worship carried on by a Buddhist priest. Before the tour is over we have seen the Emerald Buddha, magnificent temples done in gold, others in porcelain, giant grotesque statues, which, it is believed, guard these temples, and there is the large phallic symbol where phallic worship is still practiced by barren women. Then we saw the reclining Buddha, 160 feet long and 39 feet high. This represents Buddha reclining before dying and entering Nirvana, 543 years before Christ. The soles of the feet of this reclining Buddha are most interesting. There are 108 figures in mother of pearl, all having some meaning in the Buddhist religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Viewing all this brought to our minds Babylon. It could easily be seen that this religion, with all other false religions, was part of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. What a tremendous influence false religion has over the people of all nations! Is it any wonder that not many persons accept the truth in these religious lands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstanding, though, was our association with the Thai brothers at the convention itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here at Bangkok the around-the-world travelers split into two groups. One of 120 started southward, while the remaining group of 463 continued northeast to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If time seemed to be moving by quickly for the world travelers up to this point, now it was moving like a whirlwind. Each of the groups had five more conventions to attend before we met again in Honolulu and Pasadena. Our brothers speeding to the south to Singapore met with the brothers there in the Victoria Theater. Here Brothers Franz and Suiter spoke and delighted the Chinese brothers and the great mixed congregations in Singapore. They had an interesting cafeteria setup at the Adelphi Hotel roof garden, not too far away from the convention auditorium. So the brothers were able to have much fellowship together. They had a grand public meeting of 560, at which the talk was given in English and Chinese, and 22 were baptized. Having barely enough time to get acquainted, the group was off again to Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BANDUNG, INDONESIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This stop truly proved to be a rush for the world travelers. They landed in Djakarta, got into their buses, traveled through the capital and up through the mountains to the convention site at Bandung. The assembly was held in the Gedung Wanita (Women’s Hall). They had their troubles well in advance while making arrangements for the convention. The world travelers, however, did not see the tremendous amount of work that the local branch office had to do to make the convention possible. The Indonesian brothers had to shift the convention site from one place to another. But the joy of the Indonesian brothers in meeting the world travelers and the world travelers meeting the Indonesian brothers outweighed all the difficulties that were encountered. For some around-the-world travelers it meant just a stay of a little more than twenty-four hours. Those hours were packed full of excitement. After that they were off to Melbourne, Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was a long flight, going now from summer into winter near the Antarctic neighborhood. After weeks of being in countries where the languages were foreign to the ears of the majority of the travelers now they would be back in an English-speaking country. The convention site was fixed up very nicely in the Sheep Pavilion, a very appropriate name. No time had to be spent here in interpretation. The brothers were able to give the full text of their talks, this to the delight of the 9,427 who adopted the Resolution in Melbourne. A number of dark-skinned Solomon Islanders from the north attended the assembly in Western dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was cold there. Midwinter had set in, calling for overcoats to be worn. This was a witness in itself to Melbourne, for the brothers from all over Australia came to that midwinter assembly. In spite of the cold, Australian brothers helped to make it a grand success through their house-to-house witnessing, their advertising of the public meeting and their proper conduct. Many of the brothers stayed in the homes of the people of Melbourne, giving a grand witness. The newspapers made some excellent comments regarding the assembly of Jehovah’s people in Melbourne, and the television company recorded a half-hour program at our beautiful platform and telecast it the following night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The travelers now hurried on to Auckland, New Zealand. There was no room to accommodate the crowds in just one auditorium. So the brothers used the Auckland Town Hall and the Civic Theatre. Much to the surprise of the vice-president was the very warm greeting the Maori sisters gave him, even in the cold weather. In native costume and with a dance and song they greeted Brother Franz. These sisters also gave him their traditional greeting of rubbing noses. After the nose rubbings Brother Franz turned to Brother Suiter and said: “Did you do this?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All nations, tribes and peoples have their own unique and interesting way of greeting, some with leis, some with abrazos, some with nose rubbing. But with all of it comes a warmth and love from one people to another, all in Jehovah’s organization. Even though this was the winter season, the weather was good and a tremendous witness was given in Auckland, New Zealand, with 6,005 attending the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SUVA, FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now it was time to get on to Suva, Fiji, which proved to be a most interesting assembly because there were islanders from the South Pacific, Polynesians and French-speaking brothers from many places, like Tahiti and New Caledonia, from wherever the truth had been preached someone came. The Suva Town Hall was used for the general assembly of God’s people from seventeen different island groups and countries, truly international! The public talk was given in the New Lilac Theatre to a full house of 1,080. The travelers were able to see the island life of the Fijian people and their modes of travel. Their experiences were just as many and exciting and heartwarming as those of their fellow travelers on the northern trip. As they expressed it, they did not miss a thing by taking the southern trip, and it could be said, too, that those taking the northern trip did not miss a thing. It was all too wonderful to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the larger crowd of 463 moved northward from Bangkok to Hong Kong they assembled at the new City Hall, where a grand public meeting was held. Due to delays in air flights Brother Knorr arrived at the public meeting just a few minutes before it began. The hall was packed out with Chinese-speaking people. The days that followed were filled with pleasure, associating with the publishers, of whom there are not too many in Hong Kong, but these Witnesses have made good progress during the years. House-to-house witnessing, a visit to the harbor, a tour through Hong Kong and a trip into the rural areas and even to the Communist Chinese border were all thrilling and interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MANILA, PHILIPPINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But hurry, there is a convention in Manila and some of the travelers were able to spend only twentyeight hours in the Philippines. However, even though they could spend only that period of time it was packed with excitement. The Rizal Memorial Football-Track Stadium was an ideal place to hold the assembly. Just the day before the assembly was to commence a typhoon came through and blew off some of the covering of the stadium that our brothers had erected to shelter the conventioners in the bleachers from the rain or sun. They rebuilt it in a hurry when the storm let up. It proved to be beneficial in sheltering the brothers from the sun, for the days of the assembly following the hurricane were very warm. It was a wonderful experience to visit the new branch home of the Society and to see the bustling city of Manila and to enter into the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was expected that the public meeting would draw at least 30,000 people even in bad weather, for this was the monsoon season. But with a clear day and a brilliant sun 37,806 persons packed out Rizal Memorial Stadium. They overflowed into the running track, into the cafeteria and onto the sidewalks and street. What a delightful answer to the hard work that our Filipino brothers put into witnessing from house to house and advertising the public meeting! Their hearts were filled to overflowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Keep moving, for you must make three more stops in order to meet your fellow travelers from the south in Honolulu, and that is what the travelers did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOU FENG, TAIWAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taiwan was the next stop assigned for a convention. While the travelers went to Taipei by plane, we had to fly to Hualien from there and then go by bus to Shou Feng and the school ground where our Chinese and Ami brothers were gathered together in the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. Everything was held out-of-doors, and the assembly site was nestled in among the high green mountains and the valleys filled with rice fields. What a change! Far away from any city here we were in the rurals of Taiwan. We got out of the bus and walked down the deep and dusty roads. We were a spectacle to all the village folk as the travelers visited a Kingdom Hall. The hall was neat and clean, made of wood, one story high. There were the podium, the chart, the instructions for the theocratic ministry school. The congregation servant greeted us. The world travelers were delighted to see that away out here in one of these islands our brothers were doing the very same thing we are doing in the big cities of America and Europe, building their own Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The way of life is so different here, so close to the earth. No living in skyscrapers or huge apartment houses. Here you work with people of the good earth who depend on rice for a livelihood. Everyone in the village knows Jehovah’s witnesses. They have all been talked to time and time again. Here is where missionaries have been sent from America and other parts of the world to help these brothers with the truth to gain Christian maturity. We admire the devotion of the missionaries and their answer to the call to go and disciple people of all nations. How true this has been in all the countries that we have visited!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the hot afternoons the visitors listened to a talk, mingled together under the shelter built by the native brothers. They had opportunity to see their cafeteria, their cooking equipment, things that were so different but adequate. It was an experience to be remembered. Then the visitors were on their way to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KYOTO, JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Back to modern civilization—Kyoto! Here was a bustling city with one of the most up-to-date structures used for the convention site, the Kyoto Kaikan. While the city is modern, it is so different with its Japanese language and writing that makes no sense at all to the European or American who has not been schooled in the Japanese language. However, it is an interesting country. The world travelers were here long enough to do some witnessing from house to house. How gracious all the Japanese people are! We are invited into the home and kneel down on their “tatami” mats and our guide talks in Japanese while we listen and observe the interest. The householder bows her head, almost touching the floor, and then rises, walks away in her short steps, returns, hands a contribution to the brother we are with, and he gives her the publications and invites her to come to the public meeting on Sunday. The interest shown surely will prove to be sufficient to begin a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The convention hall is packed out in the afternoon and evening. No walking around in aisles or out in corridors. Our Japanese brothers and sisters have come to hear every word spoken, be it in English through an interpreter, or directly in the Japanese language. We go through the cafeteria and eat with the brothers and use chopsticks. It is a novelty, but a pleasure. Everyone who can speak a little English will say hello and try to converse and, in turn, we try to speak with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SEOUL, KOREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We only have a few more days and another stop, Seoul, Korea. To do so the convention travelers all had to go to Tokyo, where they had the opportunity of seeing the new seven-story branch office building that is being constructed. They stayed in Tokyo overnight and then flew on to Seoul, where kindness and graciousness were personified. Our brothers were hustled through customs, put in special buses and given a police escort to their hotel. Never had the world travelers experienced such a thing. For a moment some thought that the bus driver had gone mad, driving down one side of the road and then the other until they found out they were being led by a police car. A new experience, but it made you feel that this was just about the speed you were used to in traveling around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Citizens Hall, a new structure in the heart of Seoul, was the convention site, and at the very first meeting it was packed out. Was every dedicated person in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea in attendance? It seemed so. This was Seoul’s first international assembly and everyone wanted to be there. Here again the field service tour proved to be tremendously interesting. The habits and way of life of the people in the home and on the street were so different. One could talk for days about what he saw, whom he met, the houses he was in and the hospitality of the brothers. And, as though it was a dream, we had attended another public meeting of 8,975 persons, seen the branch office and done so many other things, but now we were on a plane again flying eastward to Honolulu, Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HONOLULU, HAWAII</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here all were met with the warmth and friendliness of the islands of the Pacific. Here is an island of mixed peoples, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Westerners, all nationalities blended into one with the Hawai-ians. The islands of Hawaii are themselves beauty to the extreme. The blue Pacific, the towering mountains, the clouds, the sunshine, all of these make Hawaii an ideal place for a convention. Many of the brothers in the United States and in Canada thought so too and more than 1,100 now joined the around-the-world travelers in the Waikiki Shell, where the convention took place. While we were back in the United States, it certainly did not feel like it. Hawaii is indeed an island group of the South Pacific, and the people are also a part of the South Pacific. The Waikiki Shell proved to be a delightful place in which to hold the assembly. Everything was out-of-doors, with palm trees and Diamond Head as a background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Field service was enjoyable. As we went from one house to another we found the same variety, a Korean, a Japanese person, a Filipino, a Hawaiian, an American of European descent. Is it any wonder that the work in Hawaii is growing so rapidly? The people showed much goodwill toward the truth. They were interested in the message of the Kingdom, for on Sunday at the public meeting there were 6,189, and here in Hawaii for the first time the public meeting was telecast over all the islands. It was estimated that tens of thousands saw and heard the entire lecture in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PASADENA, U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did this Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses have to come to an end? Was there not something that could be done to make the trip longer? Pasadena seemed so close now. In fact, the convention was already in session when we were closing the Hawaiian assembly. Pasadena, though, was climactic for this Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Society used the Rose Bowl in southern California and it proved to be an ideal spot in which to have the convention. It seemed that so many of the brothers from Canada and the United States and Mexico, as well as other parts of the world, wanted to be at the last convention to get a full report of what happened and to talk to the brothers who traveled around the world. They had that opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pasadena had the full program of eight days from September 1 to 8, in Spanish and English. It was the same as Milwaukee, New York, London, Stockholm and all the other assemblies. Additionally, they had the final report from around the world. The Pasadena assembly not only was the last assembly of the “Everlasting Good News” Convention but it was the biggest, winding up on Sunday afternoon with a public meeting attendance of 118,447. As this convention closed it brought to an end a seventy-one-day tour around the world in twenty-four cities. It was the greatest undertaking to date by Jehovah’s witnesses as far as conventions are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were really no hardships to talk about, no difficulties. For the around-the-world travelers it meant</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">go, go, go, but the more they traveled the stronger they seemed to get and the greater was their happiness in meeting with missionaries, congregation publishers, brothers and sisters everywhere in many tongues. To try to sum up the Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a few pages would be a difficult task, but it can be reported that in these 71 days there were 580,509 persons who attended the public meeting, and 454,977 joined in adopting the marvelous resolution that declared all of Jehovah’s witnesses to be serving the only true God and making known his message to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was ample proof that Jehovah’s witnesses were accomplishing their purpose of gathering together the “other sheep,” and 16,653 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by being baptized in water. Representatives had come to these conventions from 161 different lands throughout the world. This truly was a history-making assembly. One thing that this assembly made you feel was that, after the battle of Armageddon is over, all these brothers and sisters will want to be communicating with one another again, and it will not be at all difficult. We accomplished it once in the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. We met thousands of brothers from different parts of the earth, North America, Central and South America, all of Europe, Africa and Asia and the islands of the sea. Representatives from all six continents went around the world. There is someone who knows someone else in other parts of our earth personally, and how happy we will be to see one another again when the new system of things is in full operation. Jehovah God poured out his rich blessing upon his people and upon the entire organization that went into operation to make this convention a success, to make it a praise to Jehovah’s name, to make it a blessing to his people. For this we are all very grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IN APPRECIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a letter from London, England, a brother writes: “What a wonderful record the Around-the-World Assembly will make! What a rich blessing it has brought to us all. So I record my gratitude to Jehovah, our heavenly Father, and I want you to know of my deep appreciation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another brother in London writes: “I want to express my deep appreciation and gratitude for the great privilege in having a share in the activities of the Around-the-World Assembly. To meet with the brothers in the different countries and get an insight into the conditions under which they serve, to talk to them at their meetings, to visit so many places of interest, and do all these things in constant fellowship with the brothers and under conditions made so easy through the Society’s arrangements, to me these are the main things that made the trip outstanding and unique.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the anointed, eighty-four years of age, who lives on the island of Trinidad said: “I cannot hold back from expressing to you the blessedness I am enjoying by reading the book entitled ‘ ‘‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!’ The other book entitled ‘All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial’ has a wealth of information. We thank Jehovah and his consort King, for using the discreet slave class to place these dishes on the table for us at this juncture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister in Bangkok, Thailand, writes: “‘Thank you’ would be an understatement, so much we appreciate your visit here. We could understand your hardships, sleepless nights traveling; delays at the airport. All of the delegates endured those things smiling patiently, it was really inspiring to see. I went to the hotel to see the brothers leaving for the afternoon plane. Even though my pep was running out a little bit I was so happy to see the friends once more. It is wonderful to belong to Jehovah’s family and see the same love shining in the eyes of all brothers the world over. Thanks to Jehovah a million times and over for the warmth they left behind in every country. Such love could only be kindled by Jehovah’s holy spirit through his organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother in Burma wrote this: “As our faithful brother the apostle Paul encouraged others and was encouraged by those that appreciated his faithful efforts, so I would like to let you know how much your visit here has meant to me, and, of course, all of us here. Your untiring efforts and the detailed working out of hundreds of items for the encouragement of the brothers everywhere you went and your kind consideration for the missionaries has made a very deep impression on my heart. This recent assembly has brought untold blessings to the brothers situated over the entire earth. The results will be seen in the increase yet to come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More could be said. More letters could be quoted, but suffice it to say the travelers rejoiced and great was the blessing to all who were able to attend the &quot;Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world. All the honor for its success goes to our Great and Almighty Father, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERSEERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, a religious corporation formed in 1884, has directed the work of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world for the past eighty years. There has been a remarkable growth in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is very manifest that the Almighty God’s blessing has been upon these servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the more than one million publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom in the earth the Watch Tower Society selects zealous individuals who are mature in a knowledge of God’s Word and appoints them to do special service in the Society’s worldwide organization. Following the Scriptural requirements of not appointing “a newly converted man, for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil,” the Society selects men who are desirous of doing the fine work that is required of an overseer. The Society fully appreciates that “the overseer should therefore be irreprehensible.” (1 Tim. 3: 1-7) The president of the Society makes appointments of branch servants, district and circuit servants around the world, and the branch offices appoint congregation servants and others who qualify for special service. A heavy responsibility falls upon an overseer, for he must look well to the interests of all his brothers and sisters, and every overseer should have the same outlook that Paul had when he said: “Besides those things of an external kind, there is what rushes in on me from day to day, the anxiety for all the congregations.”—2 Cor. 11:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would be impossible to list here all the servants who carry such a load of responsibility. The list appearing in the 1964 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font7">contains just a limited number of those who have received special appointments. This list includes zone servants, some members of Bethel families, branch servants, those who have been in the full-time service for many years. They are special representatives, all ordained ministers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 37th class of the Gilead School was the second class to complete the expanded ten-month term in the new facilities of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York located in Brooklyn Heights. Graduation day was Monday, November 26, 1962. The exciting activities of this day were held in the Kingdom Hall at 107 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. Those attending the graduation exercises were the students and members of the Brooklyn Bethel family. There is not sufficient room for others to be in attendance at the Kingdom Hall. The auditorium itself was not even large enough to seat those in attendance and so the overflow crowd was accommodated in the lecture room that was tied in by loudspeaker. There were 725 in attendance at the graduation of the 37th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The program began at 3:30 p.m. with President Knorr acting as chairman. The four instructors spoke, giving excellent farewell counsel. Then the factory servant and the Bethel home servant, with whom the students had worked throughout the year, spoke to the student body. Following these brothers the Society’s vice-president, Brother Franz, spoke on the Christian’s deposit or trust. Brother Knorr gave the graduation address on “Qualified to Teach.” After this the students, who had come from 52 countries, received their diplomas and assignments, and it was learned that the 103 students were now being sent to 64 different lands. Ninety-five of the 103 graduating received diplomas of merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Graduation day proved to be a very busy one for the students and the Bethel family. It seems we all look forward to it for a whole year, as it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> grand event, something big being finished in the lives of our brothers and sisters who have come to school and the starting of another important assignment somewhere else in the world. So the day spent together, the fine evening meal and then the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study afterward along with the experiences related by the various students, gladdened the hearts of everyone in attendance. Late in the evening the program was brought to a close with a prayer of thanksgiving to Jehovah God for the day’s activities. Not too many minutes after that some of the graduates were packing and were ready for travel to their assignments. All their assignments were worked out well in advance and tickets were purchased for their travel to missionary fields. In fact, before the week was out, the Bethel home seemed vacant because of the exodus of those that the family worked with for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the Bethel family had to get acquainted with a new group that started coming in. Some arrived early to study English. By February 4, 1963, there were another 104 students mingling with the Bethel family. These came from fifty-six countries. Thirty-six branch servants were called for study at the 38th class of Gilead, and the class has proved to be an interesting one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the brothers who were students in the 38th class of Gilead had the privilege of sharing in the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses by being on the program at Yankee Stadium. As part of their schooling they were given a thorough tour of all the convention departments, and those who had been branch servants, along with many other students, will have worked in practically every department of the Bethel home, factory and offices of the Society before the ten-month course comes to a close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The instructors in the school were delighted to have the two new publications </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot;</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font7"> because these will prove to be very helpful in the verse-by-verse study of the Bible, which covers the full ten months of the school term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As this service year closes, it will not be long before the 38th class will be preparing to leave for their assignments of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some brothers who were brought to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York are staying over and are now studying English in preparation for Gilead training. Members of the Bethel family have volunteered to give them English lessons each evening and on weekends. This is very much appreciated by the students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is indeed a privilege for the members of the Bethel family to have this grand association with brothers from all parts of the world. Here is the list of the students who graduated in 1962.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania conducts special courses in all parts of the world. The Kingdom Ministry School is for the purpose of training congregation servants and special pioneers for a period of one month. This is really a refresher course designed for mature brothers and sisters, those who have a fine basic knowledge of God’s Word and organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom Ministry School is in operation in the United States at South Lansing, New York, at the Society’s Kingdom Farm. We also have the Kingdom Ministry School in operation in the London Bethel home, at Watch Tower House, and in Wiesbaden at our German Bethel home, as well as in many other countries throughout the world. The school will operate in each country until such time as all the congregation servants have had the advantage of taking this special course. Many countries have already completed the training, but perhaps in a few years we will again open the Kingdom Ministry School in these countries to train all the new congregation servants and special pioneers. Then they, too, may have the privilege of studying the special schoolbook that the Society has prepared for overseers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States 959 brothers and 79 sisters were called to school during the 1963 service year. This brought the total attending this school to 1,038 for the service year in the United States. Adding to this those already taking the course in the United States, the grand total comes to 3,320. Other countries throughout the world are doing a good work too in training their overseers. We feel that the whole organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is profiting through the good leadership the congregation servants give their fellow workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no end to study on the part of any overseer, whether he goes to school or not. All of us have the obligation toward Jehovah to gain maturity and a better knowledge of God’s Word. It is our putting into practice the things we have learned from that Word that will aid others to come to an appreciation of Jehovah’s will and purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each congregation throughout the world also has a theocratic ministry school where every member of the congregation has the opportunity of carefully studying the Bible and giving talks on selected subjects. This has proved to be most profitable and it has certainly aided all of Jehovah’s witnesses to express themselves better. Everyone dedicated to Jehovah God should certainly be enrolled in the theocratic ministry school in the congregation, if it is at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 308,370 Population: 184,883,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 600</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More time was spent preaching the good news of the Kingdom in the United States during the 1963 service year than ever before. Jehovah’s witnesses devoted 44,572,990 hours going from house to house, distributing magazines, making back-calls and conducting Bible studies. This is 3,200,000 hours better than the previous year. Some of this grand increase in hours we feel confident was due to the fine part that the congregation publishers took in the vacation pioneer service. This was the best year the United States has ever had in the average number of pioneers participating in the service. There were 11,130 regular pioneers on the average, including those in vacation pioneer work during one or two months of the service year. Additionally, there were 676 special pioneers on the average. It is hoped that the congregation publishers will continue to appreciate this grand privilege of spending a month or more in pioneer service during every year. Everyone can readily see how this additional time aids in giving a greater witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many other commendable features of the work in the United States report, such as the distribution of individual magazines. We passed the fiftymillion mark for a year’s distribution. This was the first time such an outstanding distribution took place. Home Bible studies climbed to a new high of 210,918. It is hoped that good results will be had as a consequence during the 1964 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the average there were 12,616 more publishers out in the field service each month than during the previous year, and this is good. This means we had an increase of about 5 percent over the 1962 average of publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event for the United States during 1963 was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses held in Milwaukee, New York and Pasadena. We feel sure the effect of these splendid conventions will be reflected in the progress made during the 1964 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a pleasure to see that the congregations have increased in number, now totaling 4,777. During the year 15,960 individuals were baptized. Of course, this was more than the increase in publishers. This was also true during the previous service year, when 22,000 persons were baptized and we had an increase of 18,755 publishers. This brings us to a problem that we should face, namely, that many more people are being baptized than are being consistent in their preaching of the good news. Surely they have not all died off, unless a goodly number of these or older ones in the truth have died spiritually. This presents a challenge to every overseer in the congregations. He will want to see to it that those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah are properly fed, cared for and shepherded so that they will become strong in Jehovah, advance in knowledge and prove to be mature servants of God as the years go on. Jehovah does not want to see anyone lost. Jehovah made the provision of the ransom sacrifice so that life could be gained, not lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">None of the overseers or publishers in the congregation should want to see any who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While we rejoice greatly in the gathering together of the “other sheep,” it is also our responsibility to see that they are kept in the fold to gain life. We want to aid them to take care of their responsibilities as Christians in these last days. Some of the experiences furnished in the annual report from the branch office in the United States show that one has many opportunities of witnessing no matter where he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By engaging in the witness work younger brothers and sisters have opportunity to fulfill the scripture at Matthew 21:16. A Catholic boss of a brother approached him on a Monday morning, saying, “Sunday morning a man and young boy came to my door. I was expecting the man to talk, but, to my surprise, the little fellow introduced the purpose of the call. I invited them in and said to myself—I am going to make a monkey of that kid. Pete, do you know what happened?” To the employee’s “No” the boss said, “Question after question he answered with the Bible. The kid made a monkey out of me.” He went on to say that he took a year’s subscription for the magazine, “hoping that it will do me as much good as it did him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taking advantage of opportunities to do incidental witnessing has resulted in many becoming acquainted with the truth. A few years ago a brother traveling through Arizona had to stop at a garage due to car trouble. The mechanic found the generator to be defective, and since he was busy he said he would be with him soon. To hurry the job along, the brother took off the old generator. As the mechanic worked on the car, the brother witnessed to him, and the mechanic remarked that he was the first minister he had met who was not afraid to get his hands dirty. A book was placed with him, and the brother left his name and address. A year passed and the brother received a three-page letter from the mechanic saying that he and his family read the book and all accepted the truth. Recently the brother made another trip through Arizona, visited the mechanic brother and his family, and slept in the congregation’s new airconditioned Kingdom Hall, the lot being donated by the mechanic brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In starting home Bible studies the following experience shows the value of getting the entire family to study. A study was progressing nicely with a housewife who started attending meetings, then stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When asked about it, she said her husband felt he was being neglected so he started taking her to church with him. The husband had not been invited to sit in on the study prior to this, nor had an effort been made to arrange the study so the man and his wife could learn together. The publisher decided to call on him, was invited in and explained that, since he was the head of the home, he had the right to know what his wife was learning. This resulted in a Bible discussion and the starting of a study with him, in which his wife was invited to join. Later, arrangements were made for the entire family to study together, and now both the husband and the wife are regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While these experiences have proved to be pleasant ones, there are also those that require Jehovah’s servants to “speak the word of God with boldness.” There is still opposition in different parts of the country to Jehovah’s witnesses going from door to door, and probably the greatest difficulty has come from the attempted enforcement of what is known as the “Green River Ordinance.” Certain cities have this ordinance that prohibits soliciting and peddling. While there were no such cases that resulted in convictions, sometimes such ordinances have been used to try to scare Jehovah’s witnesses and to stop them from going into territories where perhaps one or two persons have made complaints to the police or the district attorney. By the time these cases have gotten to the courts someone along the way has dismissed them or the city has dropped charges and the matter is not carried any farther. The Society, of course, explains to the city officials, usually the city district attorney, how our work is carried on, and they do appreciate knowing what the law says on the matter. Often we receive letters from city attorneys to this effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I have previously read the handbook </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News}</span><span class="font7"> which is furnished to your people as they are traveling about and agree that if they do conduct themselves as prescribed in that handbook they probably could not be required to obtain a license. ... It is not the intention of our mayor or council to restrict ‘religious liberty.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society closed its legal department, but that does not mean that the Society does not take care of the legal problems affecting Jehovah’s witnesses. When necessary, the Society obtains legal counsel in different states to represent Jehovah’s witnesses in cases that affect freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are cases involving the expulsion of children from school, such as the one in Arizona where children of Jehovah’s witnesses refused to stand and sing during the playing of the national anthem. This case was won by the attorney selected by the Society to represent the children, and a decision was rendered in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. The children were allowed to return to school to get their education. The judge said: “The key of our freedom of expression is that there is individual freedom to believe, to speak and to act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the Society’s legal office closed, we might say that we are pleased to give advice on Scriptural matters. The Society is not in a position to give legal counsel to persons on private problems, but the Society will be happy to be of assistance where possible in giving information on what the Scriptures have to say on personal problems. Any individual thinking he needs an attorney for his personal matters should choose one of his own liking locally. The Society is not in a position to recommend attorneys, any more than it is in a position to recommend doctors or surgeons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING ACTIVITIES IN BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been a constant demand for books, booklets, magazines and Bibles on the part of all the publishers around the world and it has been the pleasure of the Brooklyn factory to print and ship great quantities of these everywhere. As far as bound books are concerned, the most printed and shipped publications were Bibles, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font7"> During the year 940,316 copies were completed. This included the special one-volume edition of the large-type Bible, printing under one cover the six volumes of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> of the Christian Greek and Hebrew Scriptures. This made one grand book of 3,648 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bindery work in connection with this particular edition is done almost all by hand, as there is no machinery large enough to put such a book through our automatic bindery equipment. We were able to complete 64,000 copies of this edition during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was good to see the fine increase in the printing of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines in the Brooklyn plant. While we were not able to ship any Spanish magazines to Cuba during the past year because of the difficult relations existing between Cuba and the United States, still we were able to increase magazine production. Furthermore, we transferred the printing of the Dutch edition of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> to our German plant in Wiesbaden.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The above work was accomplished on thirty-one printing presses in the Brooklyn plant. They were all kept busy rolling off the printed page and consumed 10,022 tons of paper. This is the first year that we have ever gone over 10,000 tons, and it was an increase of 1,115 tons over last year. Let us just glance back in ten-year steps and see how rapidly this paper consumption has increased. In 1943 we used only 2,603 tons; in 1953 it was up to 4,279 tons; and in 1963 it jumped to 10,022 tons. This well reflects the tremendous increase in the distribution of the printed page containing Jehovah’s life-giving message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among other commodities also produced and used in the Brooklyn plant was 184,856 pounds of adhesives. Additionally, 120 tons of printing ink was produced. This was not only for our thirty-one presses in Brooklyn, but we also export printing ink by barrels to other printing branches of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To keep the Society’s property in good condition we also manufactured 2,845 gallons of paint in our paint department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bethel family has many things to do and does not just operate the printing plant of the Society. Many members work in the Bethel home where food must be prepared for the three meals that the family eats each day. Then there are those who look after the rooms and keep all the buildings clean and in good repair. The Society operates its own laundry. Further, many of the brothers work in offices handling the more than 800,000 pieces of mail received in a year’s time. During the year there were, on the average, 675 members in the Bethel family. In addition to this, there were 104 students going through Gilead School. So we had living with us here in the Brooklyn Bethel home 779 persons throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the close of the service year, August 31, there were 789 persons working in the Bethel home and going through school. The members of the Bethel family hold very dear their God-given privileges and responsibilities that go with being members of the family. Not only do they enjoy their work day by day in the home, office or factory, but during the evenings they have the same opportunities that other publishers of the Kingdom have, namely, of going to meetings, conducting Bible studies, participating in the field service on weekends and sharing in all congregation activity with one of the congregations in New York City. They have had a grand share in helping the congregations in New York grow. Many members of the family are congregation servants and assistant servants and study conductors in the 144 congregations of New York City, where there are 15,356 publishers associated together in the preaching activity. All the family look forward to another year of service in which they can praise Jehovah’s name and work in the interests of their brothers around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT ON OTHER TERRITORIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are a number of islands and other territories that the Brooklyn branch office has under its jurisdiction. There is good communication between these lands and the United States and so the office in Brooklyn looks after the direction of the local activity. In addition to paying particular attention to the United States congregations, the Brooklyn office also looked after Bermuda, Guam, Saipan and Sudan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Excellent expansion has taken place in Bermuda during the past year, and without doubt the increase in full-time pioneer ministers has aided greatly in this regard. A vacation pioneer schoolgirl accompanied a special pioneer into the service. They talked to a housewife and she accepted the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> and requested five additional copies for gifts. On the first back-call the husband was at home and listened in. His many Bible questions were answered weekly. The special pioneer would always conclude the study period with brief explanations of the Scripturalness of Jehovah’s organization and would show the worldwide scope of the Kingdom activity. It was not long before the husband exclaimed, “This is the truth! At last we have found the right way to worship God.” Now the man and his wife are attending all the meetings with their two children and are regular publishers and have been baptized. It is always good to study with the husband and wife together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Calling upon spiritually inactive ones has helped the Bermuda congregation grow. Many years ago a family of twelve, where the parents and oldest son were dedicated and the younger children were being educated for New World living, gradually ceased their association with the New World society. Periodic visits were made, but no results were forthcoming. Following the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly a call was made on this family, utilizing the practical approach outlined in the demonstration at the convention. Patience and kindly counsel were applied. A home Bible study was suggested for the family and promptly accepted. Now the oldest son, who is twenty-one, is back in service fulfilling his dedication vows, and the rest of the family is making good spiritual progress. The point is, when watching demonstrations at conventions, we want to take home with us the ideas given and put them to practical use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43,943</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Guam experienced the greatest disaster of its history when typhoon Karen swept the island on November 11, 1962. However, with all its savage fury Karen could not destroy the spiritual growth that had been obtained here. Many things that we experienced after typhoon Karen really strengthened our faith here. There were the prayers, love and concern expressed in letters from the Society and many brothers around the earth. Then came financial assistance, clothing and food from the brothers in the States. How the brothers here appreciated this material aid! But it was the expression of Christian love on the part of their brothers that they appreciated most of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then just at the right time, to keep us mindful of our spiritual well-being, the Society sent the zone servant to visit us. How thankful we were for his visit, the assembly and feast of spiritual food! This gave us the right mental attitude toward our ministry in this time of rebuilding after the typhoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though many of the brothers here are living in temporary shelters, we have pushed ahead with Jehovah’s blessing. During the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign we had the visit of the circuit servant. The publishers enjoyed this arrangement and supported the field service program well during the week. What were the results? The brothers obtained fifty-four subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the school term was coming to an end a part of the service meeting was devoted to what teen-agers could do with their vacation time. One young publisher accepted the thought of conducting a home Bible study. She approached a neighborhood friend about her own age, and a Bible study was started. Soon her friend began to attend the congregation book study and then the other congregation meetings. What a wonderful and rewarding way to spend a school vacation!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SAIPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two missionaries arrived on Saipan, September 13, 1962. In spite of this being a solid-Catholic island, many goodwill persons with strong hearts are taking their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At first the people were not accustomed to having someone call from door to door. One day while they were going from house to house, a young man asked the missionaries what they were doing. They explained that they were engaged in a Christian work teaching the people from the Catholic Bible and doing the work that Christ and the apostles did. In time, a Bible study was started. He asked if they had a Catholic Bible. He obtained it and read it from then on. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book was also placed and he and his wife thoroughly read the book. He soon found out that the Catholic doctrine was false and he was concerned about letting the other people know the truth. He is so zealous to study the Bible that he usually ends up studying for two hours or more. Many of his friends have admitted </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">that he</span><span class="font7"> is changing. His previous manner of speech was not Christian but obscene talk. His friends are amazed and impressed with his worthwhile and upbuilding Bible language. This reminds us of the scripture at Ephesians 4:22-24, where Paul states that we “should put away the old personality</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The work moved ahead steadily during the service year and we rejoice in the increase. The visits of the zone and circuit servants were appreciated and undoubtedly contributed toward the expansion. Here are several experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sister was anxious to see her mother get the truth but was unsuccessful in starting a study. When her brother returned home from his law studies in Germany, the mother asked her son if he felt it was wise for her to study. He answered, “They are morally good people. Why not?” The study was started, the mother made some progress, but it was rather slow. The son came home again from Germany, and asked his mother to invite several ministers in for a discussion. Two brothers came, making a fine impression upon this law student. The mother is now dedicated and the son shows a strong interest in the message, indicating he wants a personal Bible study after finishing his law course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another sister started a study with an old friend and encouraged the person of goodwill to spend some time after each study discussing different features of the organization. Then the lady attended a circuit assembly and there noticed the warmth and friendliness of the brothers. She and her husband viewed the assembly as a gathering of “a happy family.” Later she said: “My house is big enough for the next assembly. The next assembly will be in our home.” The home was large enough and the next assembly was held there. Since that time this person of goodwill, along with one of her relatives, symbolized her dedication to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother who went to serve where the need is great entered a house to make repairs on the electrical lighting system and noticed a Bible next to one bed. He ascertained the owner of the Bible and had a very fine discussion on the identity of the True God. After several back-calls this person’s interest was built up, subscriptions were taken for the magazines and several publications were placed. When the brother had to leave the country, this person of goodwill, on his own, asked for the name of the overseer so that he could have his studies continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence, the work continues to go on apace in Sudan, one of the countries in the world where the need is</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Many of the brothers from Alaska were able to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly and they benefited greatly from the instructive program. There was an excellent increase in publishers in Alaska during the past service year. The brothers made a fine effort in reaching out to the remote parts of the land to preach. Congregation publishers and pioneers welcomed this opportunity to work unassigned territory. Sometimes they stayed two days or more in small villages. One pioneer reports working in Haines, Alaska, where a group placed twenty-six books, eight subscriptions and eighty magazines. Many ways are employed to reach isolated territory, and here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alaska is a vast territory and often the only means of getting to a town is by plane. This can be very expensive and so many remote villages are seldom, if ever, systematically worked. However, this summer one of these villages of about 500 people was worked by a brother who is a mechanic for an airline. The company sent him there to service an aircraft, and on his day off he worked the town. He was able to leave twenty-one books, thirty-three booklets and eighty-three magazines with the people of the village. It is hoped that some of this seed will fall on good soil and bear fruit to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where isolation makes it impossible to share in the regular door-to-door ministry, letter writing is being effectively used. A publisher in an isolated logging camp in southeastern Alaska reports: “About a month ago the branch office sent us a back-call slip on an eleven-year-old girl who is also isolated and asked someone to study with her. My ten-year-old sister wrote to the girl and suggested a study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book by mail. Imagine how happy she was when the girl wrote back sending the answers to the first chapter in the book and expressed her gratitude for the study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience shows the effort one pioneer publisher put forth in showing neighbor love: “Some years ago I took the time to learn the alphabet in sign language in order to talk to a custodian at the hospital where I worked. This past year I learned we had a neighbor who was deaf-mute and I knew that no one in the congregation had reached him with the good news of the Kingdom. So I introduced myself by spelling out in sign language ‘Hi.’ Soon the ‘conversation’ was directed to the Bible. He subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and I had a new Bible study that proved to be most interesting. John was learning the Bible and I was learning a new language. He soon began attending all the meetings, started in the door-to-door ministry with another brother and has attended two circuit assemblies. He was baptized yesterday, so becoming the first deaf-mute minister of Jehovah’s witnesses in Alaska.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 20,956,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,754 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,148</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The new branch office and Bethel home has become a center of learning for overseers and special pioneers. Over 135 students have gone through the Kingdom Ministry School, and these have expressed their appreciation for being able to live with the Bethel family to get special training. These overseers appreciate more than ever the need of maturity, not only on their part, but on the part of all the publishers. One congregation of eighty publishers arranged for twenty ministers to vacation pioneer during April. The servant leadership in this congregation is what brought 25 percent of the congregation up to the vacation pioneer activity for that one month. Many persons in Argentina with whom the Kingdom publishers study have responded to the invitation extended to them to join in the preaching and teaching activity. Therefore Argentina enjoyed a fine increase of 10 percent in new publishers during the past service year. Jehovah’s witnesses spent 1,748,683 hours giving the greatest witness ever in that land. They conducted 9,213 Bible studies each week, on the average, during the past year with fine re<a name="bookmark193"></a><a name="bookmark194"></a>suits. Here are a few of the experiences submitted by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Excellent results were obtained by three pioneer sisters who said just as the apostle Paul did: “Let us return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities in which we published the word of Jehovah.” They were rewarded by the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a village about four hours from their assignment, there were a group of subscribers that had heretofore been attended to by letters. The sisters, wishing to give greater assistance, made a trip to the village. One of the persons they especially had in mind showed genuine appreciation for their loving help, accompanying them in the preaching work several days, working twelve hours placing a subscription and twenty-eight magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the false shepherds, who have no love for the “sheep,” reacted in their centuries-old, typically negative way—they tried to scare the “sheep”—but to no avail. Despite their covering the village with a sound car warning the people not to listen, more than twenty Bible studies were started, and that Sunday seventeen persons attended the first </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study ever held in the village. All in attendance took part in the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four years ago a worried-looking person at a bus stop in V---- asked one of the special pioneers if</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the announcement about the end of the world was true. (Someone had announced that the world was to end on such and such a day.) She was so impressed by the Biblical answer she received that she invited the sister to visit and stay with her some time in S----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On arriving, they looked her up, and she permitted them to stay at her home. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study was held in her home also. She showed so much goodwill that she had the girls witness to her until the small hours of the morning; sleepiness was the only thing that stopped them all. She and her daughter, who was an atheist, now study diligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant reports: “We went to the home of the person whose name we had received from the office, but she was at work. We went to her place of work, and when we said that we were Jehovah’s witnesses, she exclaimed: ‘Ah, brothers!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We informed her that we had been sent by the Society as a result of her writing. She immediately manifested her desire to go out in service but said that she did not know how, and that she did not have literature with which to work. Later, after work, she showed us the only literature that she had, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and a Bible, both well studied. These had been placed originally with the family of her girl friend. Though very familiar with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book, she did not know of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> or other publications. We showed her how to study, and reviewed Study 44 of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Qualified to Be Ministers’</span><span class="font7"> with her. We also taught her a simplified sermon to use in the field.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The office has since heard twice from this sheeplike person, and is happy to say that this month two sisters are vacation pioneering in her city and helping her in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,869,475</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 16,544 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 657</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the earth are determined to press ahead without any shrinking back so they can preserve alive their souls. Good progress was made in Australia during the 1963 service year. New Kingdom Halls were erected and dedicated, but the outstanding event for Australia was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly held in Melbourne. One householder said: “Your organization has been the topic of conversation for the past week all around here. Some for it, some against, but all unanimous in their praise of the behavior of any members who were boarded with them.” Here are some of the experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 70 percent of all Australian brothers attending the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly at Melbourne at the end of the service year felt it was well worth the effort to be present. While there were some misgivings about holding an international assembly during the winter season in a city notorious for its bad weather at that time, these thoughts were soon dispelled as the brothers assembled for the opening session on Friday morning. A national magazine with considerable influence published the following: “Melbourne has seen some marvelous conferences, like the Country Women’s Conference and the World Power Conference, but I don’t think we have ever seen anything like the ‘Everlasting Good News Assembly’ of Jehovah’s witnesses. There are 16,500 Jehovah’s witnesses in Australia, and we had over 12,000 of them here in Melbourne. The organization was really something, with fleets of special trains and buses. . . . The grand gathering was in the Sheep Pavilion, Australia’s biggest shed. Many thought that this was a nice Biblical touch having all the witnesses in the Sheep Pavilion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thousands of brothers expended themselves to get to Melbourne for the assembly. An elderly sister, eighty years of age, saved ten shillings from each pension for two years so that she could be present, this in spite of the fact that she is almost blind. One young boy of eleven rose at 5 a.m. each morning to collect bottles before school, sold papers in the evenings, cut lawns and did many other odd jobs to earn his own fare. His sister, age nine, grew flowers and sold them as well as performing odd jobs for the neighbors, and in this way they helped the family with the heavy expense to get to Melbourne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Observing that few congregations were able to reach the subscription quota during the four-month campaign, the Society obtained a report from the overseer of one congregation that did. He explained to the Society the following eight-point program that the congregation had applied in reaching its objective: (1) servant leadership; (2) setting congregation, group and personal goals; (3) following up all expiration slips thoroughly; (4) exploring all avenues for new subscribers; (5) being subscription conscious at all times; (6) keeping the campaign alive by relating experiences from the platform; (7) using visual aids on the Kingdom Hall notice board; and (8) praying and working for Jehovah’s blessing to encourage the brothers all the time. In this congregation nine of the servants obtained 40 of the 116 subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Keeping the yeartext in mind daily can give us courage to continue faithfully serving. Said one publisher: “On Friday evening the congregation overseer announced that the following Saturday there would be street work. I rejoiced to hear of this privilege and prepared myself. The next morning I came equipped with plenty of magazines but was very disappointed to And that I was the only one there and I started to lose courage. I felt like going home, but after considering the yeartext I decided to try. That day I placed fifty-two magazines, made arrangements for a Bible study, which later was continued with great interest, and made many back-calls. Now I realize the importance of street work and I would not leave it even if I must go alone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How would you like to start a study that would grow into six family studies and eventually see eight get baptized, as a result of being faithful in small things? The brother who related the following experience says it all took place because he kept a record of interest on the house-to-house record and followed it up. “After two or three visits were made the householder still had not been contacted, but I was determined to find somebody in that home. One Saturday I called after magazine work and found the householder there and was invited in. We had a short discussion and I placed the magazines with her and arranged to start a Bible study. After a week or two the person said, ‘I have been discussing this at work in my spare time. There are a couple of interested people. Would you speak to them about this wonderful truth?’ So I went along and saw these two other families and eventually we invited them, and then there were eight of us studying together. To study with eight persons becomes too much for one to handle and so we decided to break the study up into three family study groups. One family then started talking to their neighbors and it was not long before they wanted a study. . . . Others started talking to their neighbors, until eventually six families were studying. Nov/ eight of them are baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,073,807</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,414 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 954</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work has moved ahead at a steady pace during the past year. The Society continues to put stress on the training of the Kingdom publishers and emphasizes the need to reach out for maturity. Among Jehovah’s witnesses there can never be a slowing down in the study of the Word of God. It is most important to give diligent attention to learning God’s will for man, and with so many new ones associating with Jehovah’s witnesses they must be alert to teach such ones the truth and to aid them in every possible way. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer was able, by means of his knowledge, to have a fine experience. He called back where he had left some magazines, but this time the man was very harsh and said: “Go to the neighbors.” He tried to overcome this objection, but got the same reply. So the brother took leave and said in a friendly way that he would go to the neighbors. In this moment another man who was in the room said: “In this case I have also something to say.” He was the neighbor! Now he asked the brother for proofs that the extant Bible manuscripts and different German translations are authentic. The brother’s explanations obviously satisfied the man, and he invited him to speak also to his wife. She was indeed thirsting for the water of life. At the third study in the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> she bought a Bible and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> As she is manageress in a factory she meets many people, and soon she placed three Bibles, four </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> books and many booklets with her fellow workers. Another family who got some magazines from her were so interested that the pioneer is now also conducting a Bible study in their home. This man is so enthusiastic that he gets up at five o’clock in the morning to read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> before he goes to work. Both families regularly attend the meetings and are full of zeal for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides knowledge, adaptability and courage are often required. A publisher had frequently called on a family, but could never do more than place some magazines. It seemed impossible to arrange a home Bible study. One day the lady received the brother in the entrance hall, apologized, and asked him to go because she had visitors who were very much opposed to Jehovah’s witnesses. The publisher now asked tactfully if he might speak to them. Perhaps they were only prejudiced because they had never had an opportunity to speak to one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The lady hesitated and then agreed. The result was that not only the interested family, but also the visitors accepted a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book, two home Bible studies were arranged, and all of them are making good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHAMAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112,556</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 255 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 441</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A good delegation from the Bahamas attended the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York. One family took the trip around the world. The branch servant reported that two brothers who are new in the truth persuaded their wives to go along to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York with them. Their wives were so impressed by the assembly that they were eager to share in preaching the good news of the Kingdom when invited to do so after their return to the Bahamas. Sometimes assemblies greatly impress people who have believing mates. If they are willing to sit and listen during assemblies they learn many things that they may never have given their partner in life an opportunity to tell them, much preferring to hear it from someone else. It is worthwhile for others in your home who are not in the truth to go to meetings with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An effort to attend meetings is always rewarded. To support an out-island assembly brothers on the main island hired a special plane to take them to Eleuthera. Even though the opening day was a public holiday with special activity for the schoolchildren, the teacher gladly offered to hold their activities in the morning so that the schoolroom could be used for the evening assembly. Many local people attended that evening. Seven were immersed. One was nine years old, another ninety-two. Though this ninety-two-year-old person has to walk with a stick and travel thirty miles each way by truck to be at meetings, this dear old sister has not missed a meeting yet, even though to get up the stairs to the meeting place she has to move on her hands and knees! Neither did she miss our local “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, which meant a round-trip journey of well over a hundred miles by boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bible studies by mail can produce results. With our territory scattered about on many isolated islands, preaching at times is done by mail. A list of questions with space to All in the answers, or else two or three pages from a publication with notations in the margin, are posted back and forth for checking. Two persons who have studied in this way were baptized this year when the circuit servant visited them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two young publishers, ages seven and nine, were able to draw a man of seventy-two years to the truth by the sensible answers they gave him. He was greatly impressed by them and saddened to think that with all his years of attending church he was unable to give answers as they did. Now he is a dedicated brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,228,729</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,837 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,178</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The majority of the brothers in Belgium went to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Munich, Germany. About 4,500 from Belgium attended that convention. Of these, 100 were special pioneers and missionaries who had been helped by the contributions received from the brothers everywhere to aid many of their fellow workers to get to a convention. The branch servant says these brothers and sisters who were aided so generously by their brothers want to express their thanks to everyone. As the branch servant says, the fine spiritual food received at the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly will certainly stimulate all of Jehovah’s witnesses in the months ahead to press on with the great work that remains to be done. Belgium, like all other countries, has reported some very interesting experiences, and here are a few that occurred in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Physical disabilities can keep some in bed, but certainly not from speaking or writing the truth. An eighty-six-year-old sister is confined to bed, being half paralyzed, but she writes letters. She checks announcements in the newspapers about people who died recently and writes comforting letters to the family or relatives, enclosing each time a tract “Hope for the Dead.” A lady was so depressed after having lost her husband, that the letter she got from that sister was truly like a balm on a wound. She noticed that the tract was put out by Jehovah’s witnesses and, as she knew one of them, she immediately called on her to show her the letter she received. She explained that, instead of getting comfort from her own family, she was more and more depressed. But now a total stranger was writing to her, giving her the comforting hope held by the Scriptures. “Well,” she said, “if the religion described by that fine lady incites its members to help their fellowman to such a degree, I want to know more about it.” Literature was placed with her, and arrangements were made for a Bible study. What a joy for that eighty-six-year-old crippled sister to learn about the wonderful results of the good work she is doing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazines play a very important part in spreading the Kingdom message. Therefore the need of establishing a magazine route cannot be overemphasized. Once the route is established, it is not difficult to select the interested people to call back on at a definite time. A special pioneer decided to make such a back-call on a person on his magazine route. Arrangements were</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">made to call back when the husband was at home, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book was placed then. Two days later, as the special pioneer was walking down the street, the lady called him, saying that her husband wanted to see him immediately. The husband had been reading in the book and wanted to know many things, such as why the book shows Jesus hanging on a pole instead of a cross, and so forth. A study was started immediately. Two weeks later the couple attended the district assembly and, upon noticing that none of the Witnesses was a smoker, they quit that bad habit. Now these people have progressed to the point of starting in the service and dedicating their life to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has stressed time and again the necessity of trying to conduct Bible studies with entire families. That means that one sometimes has to do something to get everyone interested in the study. The results can be very gratifying. A sister explains how she had a study with a family where there were two girls, one sixteen and the other one twenty years old. The latter one would not sit down to study but would rather watch television. The sister inquired and found out the girl did not want to study because she had a Catholic girl friend who was influencing her. The sister decided to call on her girl friend. She was able to iron out several doctrinal problems raised, and placed a book with her. The girl friend called the next Tuesday at the home of her friend and told her about it. The next week when the publisher came to conduct the study, she was very pleased to see everyone around the table, to study the unifying Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,556,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 552 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,442</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bolivia is situated high in the Andes Mountains in South America. However, even here among the Indians and Spanish-speaking people the good news must be declared. It was a joy to see that this year for the first time the publishers reached a peak of 552, passing the 500 mark. They have enjoyed a very good year in hours, magazine distribution, new subscriptions and Bible studies. All this is indicative of fine progress. Here is a very interesting experience that was sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One native brother who was persistent in covering his territory writes: “It was the fourth time that I had been at this house. I remembered that they had rejected the message before, but for some reason the man invited me in. His wife hid herself, however, to make me think she was not home; but during the sermon I could see her hiding behind the door also trying to hear. When I made a return visit on this family, both husband and wife were waiting for me and were full of questions about the Bible and our work. After the discussion they stated that things had never before seemed so clear. Even their own Catholic religion had not told them such things. They agreed that this must be the truth. Two months after the study was started, they started in the preaching work and began attending meetings. Later I learned why they had accepted the truth at the time they did. This couple was nearly at the point of divorce due to serious marital problems when the truth came to them and changed things. Even the neighbors were aware of the lives these persons had led, and they now comment that since the Witnesses have come they have changed completely. The couple said that the reason for their happiness and peace now is that they both know what the Christian requirements are for the man and wife through a study of God’s Word. They plan on being baptized soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 74,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 30,118 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,457</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The political situation in Brazil and the everrising inflation have not discouraged Jehovah’s witnesses. They continue preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Their hope is firmly fixed on God’s new system of things. They know that faith is required and they press on with Jehovah’s service. One of the outstanding things in Brazil is that the attendance at the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study for the entire country is now 105 percent of the total publishers. In other words, more people come to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study than are publishers of the Kingdom. Is it any wonder, then, that the work grows so fast in Brazil? This has necessitated the building of a new Bethel home and Kingdom Hall on the Society’s property. This has proved to be a great asset in the expansion work. The branch <a name="bookmark195"></a><a name="bookmark196"></a>servant sent in some very interesting experiences and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“All want to express their gratitude for the financial aid given to such a large number of brothers in Brazil so that they could attend one of the Around-the-World Assemblies. It truly was an expression of love on the part of the Society and the brothers whose contributions made it possible for so many to attend the assemblies. All have been refreshed and strengthened spiritually, and this reflects itself in the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While stopping at an isolated town, a traveling representative of the Society had the opportunity to witness to several families. One of the families showed much interest in the Kingdom message. Since there were no publishers living in that town to follow up and take care of the interest, he decided to make back-calls through correspondence. He invited the family to write and ask questions. The family did. Questions were also asked in return to encourage study and research, and the family would answer the questions propounded by mail. This regular exchange of letters turned out to be a Bible study conducted by mail. The family began to witness to their relatives and neighbors and wrote of their experiences. When the time came for the local circuit assembly to be held, the family was invited. There they had the privilege of attending the service meeting and participating in the house-to-house work with mature publishers. This training was very vital to them and helped them to make greater progress in the ministry. They are now regular publishers. An isolated group was formed and the family will be receiving further help and training through the regular visit of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who have accepted the invitation to serve where the need is great have also been richly blessed. After an assembly a brother and his wife made arrangements to move to a town of about five thousand inhabitants where little witness was being given. After two years ten publishers were reporting field service and now there is a small congregation formed, fruits of the labor of these two publishers. Another couple sent in their vacation pioneer applications and selected territory where the need was great. After working as vacation pioneers for four months the couple applied for an extension of an additional four months. At the end of eight months they were conducting ten Bible studies, and a congregation of eleven publishers was formed. Entire families also experienced the blessings that come with serving where the need is great. A family in Bahia State moved to a small city where no one was preaching God’s kingdom. They lived and served there patiently for three years. Despite the objections from the local clergy, people of goodwill were accepting the truth, and as more workers were added the growth became faster. An abandoned church building was purchased and transformed into a Kingdom Hall. From that point the truth spread in the locality so that now there are three congregations and two isolated groups of publishers, making a total of a hundred active publishers reporting field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wife of a district servant was handed some expiration slips while working with a congregation together with her husband. Some of the slips were several months old, but she thought that they were worth at least one call. Some had moved, and in making the calls she had to go to as many as three different addresses before the right person was contacted. What were the results? In all, seven subscriptions were obtained and one Bible study was started. It also helped the brothers see their privilege of calling on all persons whose subscriptions expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reading and writing school, conducted in 414 congregations throughout Brazil, has helped 447 persons of goodwill and publishers to learn to read and write during the past year. One publisher happily relates his experience: “It is with pleasure and happiness that I write you to thank you, in the name of Jehovah, for the wonderful provision of the Society to help persons like me to read and write. When I first began to learn the truth I could not go from house to house alone because I was not able to read. Now I am very happy because I have learned to read and am able to give sermons at the doors. I already conduct a home Bible study, thanks to Jehovah.” At a recent circuit assembly a brother seventy-nine years of age read his own experience telling how at his age he was able to learn to read at the congregation reading school. He is now an effective publisher. Another man of thirty-eight told how he attended a public talk once and liked what he heard, but since he was leading a bad life and, besides, was unable to read, he thought it was hopeless for him to try to learn anything and change his way of life. However, back-calls were made on him by the local publishers and he was encouraged to come to the meetings, and finally he enrolled in the reading and writing school. He learned the truth, learned to read, changed his way of life and now is a servant and book study conductor in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;590,140</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 882 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 669</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our brothers in British Guiana met some very stiff circumstances during the past service year, but in spite of the difficulty they were able to reach a new peak of 882 publishers who engaged in Kingdom service. The publishers had to put up with riots, a seventy-nine-day general strike during which all the meetings had to be held in the daylight hours, and the inconvenience of having no literature coming into the country because the shipping lines were not operating. There was also a shortage of food, and people had to spend many hours searching for the necessities of life. From the end of April until the end of July no magazines were received. Still the brothers carried on their faith-inspiring ministry with zeal and love. They kept in mind the admonition from Jehovah’s Word: “Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (Heb. 10:39) This had its rewards, as pointed up in the experiences received from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the strike period the question arose, How could we organize an assembly with no mail service, no trains, fuel and food in short supply, and buses so packed that people even sat on the tops of them? Well, other organizations were canceling their arrangements, but the brothers went ahead with circuit assembly preparations with flrm faith that Jehovah would provide the necessities. Program assignments were given out during a fifty-mile bicycle ride and other mail was delivered along the bus route. How about food? By a short trip across the river to neighbouring Surinam supplies were obtained to augment the cafeteria contributions. Would the brothers come? Yes! They came by means of bus and bicycle transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Distributing literature is a wonderful way to sow seeds that will germinate and bring forth fruit to Jehovah’s praise! In August 1961 a letter was received at the branch office from a young man, who wrote: “I’ve read the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font7"> and am quite interested in it. My ambition is to be a missionary . . . I’m a lad of sixteen and to me preaching the gospel and following Christ makes me happy and I hope we shall And paradise.” The Society advised the special pioneer in this area to contact the lad. A study was started right away, but the boy was severely opposed by his family. Still, following Christ was his heart’s desire, and just a few months ago he became our youngest special pioneer brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five years ago a brother went to live in isolated territory two hundred miles from the nearest congregation. He organized meetings for his family of seven and a few interested people, but soon it was only his own family that attended the meetings. Although he and his family worked hard against all kinds of opposition, there was no increase. In fact, the brother wrote to the circuit servant saying that he was despondent and was considering returning to the coast, where he felt he could accomplish more. Later, just before the circuit servant was due to leave for his annual visit to this territory, he received another letter from the brother. Now he was rejoicing as at last a sheeplike person had been found and was attending meetings and sharing in the field service weekly. This goodwill person plans to be baptized at the forthcoming district assembly. Perseverance pays off!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,453</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 344 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 292</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work of preaching and teaching the good news of the establishment of God’s kingdom to the people of British Honduras during the past service year went ahead by leaps and bounds. The publishers enjoyed a 29-percent increase. This does not mean that everything went smoothly. They had their internal troubles and they are still in great need of capable brothers to handle some of the congregations and to give the proper lead. Newly interested ones have flocked rapidly into the organization, and it is hoped that those in the truth will be able to set right examples for all the new ones and that all will maintain their integrity. Keeping busy in the service is one of the important things, as well as attending meetings. Here is a very interesting experience that the branch servant sent in concerning a special pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> approached a man in front of the Catholic church and introduced two of the latest magazines. He took them and promised to read them as soon as he got to his farm. Three weeks later I met this man again, but before I spoke he asked me for more of our magazines. Two copies were placed with him. This time he asked, also, how it would be possible for him to obtain two bound books advertised on the cover of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> of July 8, 1963. I told him I could get them for him, but, being very curious at what might have aroused his interest, I inquired why he wanted the books </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Your Will Be Done on Earth’</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified.’</span><span class="font7"> He then related that he had taken the first two magazines to ‘patronize’ me, but with the intention of tearing them up as soon as he got to his farm. On arriving at his farm he opened his valise to destroy them, but decided to do so later. A few days went by and he forgot all about the magazines. He had occasion one day to write a letter and so entered his valise for his writing pad, which had on its cover a picture of a half-nude woman. It was the first time he noticed the pad he bought. Being a ‘Catholic and a godly person’ he would not have such a picture around, so he tore off the cover of the writing pad and placed the pad inside the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">to keep it clean. While doing so, however, his attention was drawn to one of the subjects on the cover of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine. At this he sat down to read and never got up until he had read through both magazines! He said, ‘Imagine what I would have done just because of my church! They say your books are no good. Well, I want to get these magazines always. I will subscribe for both for a year by next Saturday.’ He then paid for the two bound books, got more magazines and promised to make arrangements to attend all congregation meetings on Sunday nights. If I had not supported magazine work every Saturday, I would not have met this man, as Saturday is the only day of the week he gets into town to sell his farm products.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of our brothers were privileged, along with the missionaries, to attend the New York and Pasadena Around-the-World Conventions. Now, with plans for our assembly in September, all are looking forward to start the new service year with a joyful shout of praise to the Most High God for his excellent works in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;53,301,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 51,725 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,030</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark198"></a>The outstanding event of the year in the British Isles was the assembly in Twickenham Stadium. Whether this will have any deep and lasting effect on the people of Britain, or London, is yet to be determined. On the average, during the service year of 1963 there were only 211 more publishers engaging in the field service in the British Isles than during the previous year. Even though more than seven million hours were spent in preaching the good news, there was not a great increase in proclaimers of the Kingdom good news. This is something for the British brothers to give serious thought to, to determine the reason why the increase was so small. There were 3,079 persons baptized during the year. There have been losses along the way and these losses were brothers who were dedicated to Jehovah God. They are having the experiences and the joy of gathering together the “other sheep,” but the brothers in England, and especially the overseers, should feel the responsibility of aiding those who are already a part of the Lord’s organization. These problems face God’s people all around the world, as well as in the British Isles. The branch office there sent in some fine experiences for the British Isles and for the territories they look after in Aden, Gibraltar and Malta.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters who vacation pioneered together write: “This was the fifth time we had a share in the vacation pioneer work and we both say it was certainly the happiest and the most rewarding yet. Because of having to be home to have lunch ready at midday, we could not waste time by traveling too far to the work. So we worked locally on territory that has been covered many times before. Yet, it was in this territory that we had such a wonderful time with placements and back-calls. Now we have started two new Bible studies each, with prospects of more to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Our only regret is that circumstances will not permit us to continue in the pioneer service, but we are thankful for the provision of the vacation pioneer work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sixteen-year-old brother was engaged in the house-to-house work, using his Bible to give a prepared sermon. The territory included some very large houses in a well-to-do section. At one of these homes he talked to the director of a well-known firm, and this man was so impressed with the sermon that he asked this young brother to step in. A study was then started with this director, although at that time his wife was not very interested. Later the director talked to the personnel manager of this firm, and soon the personnel manager joined the Bible study. His wife also was not interested. Later both the director and the personnel manager witnessed to one of the van drivers who, although he was not interested himself, talked to his wife, and she showed definite interest in this Bible study. One evening the driver and this youthful minister had a three-hour discussion on evolution, which finally convinced the driver that he should look into the truth for himself. Now this young brother reports that the director and his wife, the personnel manager and his wife and the driver and his wife all attend the meetings regularly. So, from this one call where a youthful minister was prepared to give the sermon from the Bible, three families are gaining a knowledge of the truth and already one of them has been immersed and three others engage regularly in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the calls that are made during the week when husbands are on secular work, wives often come into the truth before their husbands. Sometimes these husbands are described as being opposed, and may even interfere with the dedicated service of the preaching wife. One overseer was made to realize, while attending the Kingdom Ministry School, that he was not really giving this matter much attention in the congregation. So when he returned, with the help of other servants and mature publishers he decided to concentrate on helping nine families where the husbands were considered opposed and the wives were in the truth. After making a series of friendly calls timed to find the husbands at home, the congregation servant had this report to make: “Three of the husbands are now having Bible studies and are attending the congregation meetings along with their wives. Four others have definitely shown interest and have come to some meetings at the Kingdom Hall. We are hoping that soon further studies can be started to help these men appreciate the good news of God’s kingdom. The remaining two can be described as very friendly and I am sure they are far less opposed and difficult with their wives than they were prior to being visited.” The overseer concluded by saying that he thought that this circumstance could be avoided in the beginning if the Bible study were held with the entire family. He gave as an example a recent experience that he and his wife had enjoyed: “When a woman who had been studying in another area moved into our congregation territory I took my wife around to continue the study and at the same time I wanted to see the husband, who apparently was rather cool toward the Witnesses. The result in this case was that the husband not only studied but within six months became a dedicated brother and was baptized three months before his wife.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Incidental witnessing is always a means of directing people’s attention to Scripture, and many publishers have found the use of a Bible tract to be very helpful. A brother whose secular job involves visits to retail shops in large cities can spend only a few brief seconds in giving a witness as the opportunity affords, so he has made it a practice to carry tracts with him. While visiting one shop he placed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> tract with the cashier. On his next visit he took the magazines along and was able to stimulate further interest, subsequently obtaining a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Finally, the cashier was shown a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and was so thrilled with this publication that she showed it to others where she worked. As he left this same shop another employee stopped him and asked if he could get “one of these beautiful orange books.” So on his next call another </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book was placed and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> was introduced and likewise placed. Meanwhile a third person in that shop had seen the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and the Bible and wanted one of each. As one talked to another, the result of the original placement of a tract has meant the placing of five Bibles, three </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> books and three subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> And now the cashier who originally took the tract has arranged to have a regular Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 31,429</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The one dedicated brother in Aden last year was joined by a couple from South Africa and another sister from England. Now for the first time there can be the interchange of encouragement by association! The first meeting to be arranged was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No regular preaching has been organized so far, but it has been grand to see the results from incidental witnessing—a peak of seven publishers and fourteen home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just before the London assembly, the couple who had just settled there found it necessary to come to England for a short period. This enabled them to attend the eight-day convention, and the Society has arranged for the brother to attend the Kingdom Ministry School before he returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GIBRALTAR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,418</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just like the saying “strong as the rock of Gibraltar,” so the congregation that is located on this rocky peninsula has stood firmly during its second year of activity. Opposers were confident that the forced departure of the four special pioneers two years ago would bring an end to this little group of Jehovah’s “sheep.” But not so! This year has seen solid growth toward maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The regular visits of the circuit servant have been the only contact that this congregation has had with “outsiders.” We have tried to get permission for someone to go to Gibraltar, but this permission has been withheld. So this summer we were indeed happy to arrange for the overseer to come to London for the convention and the assistant congregation servant to go to Milan. Additionally, ten other publishers went along to Milan, and the association and spiritual benefits of these programmes were deeply appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The overseer remained in London to attend the Kingdom Ministry School and has now just returned to his congregation. He writes, “I am more determined than ever to continue serving Jehovah, upbuilding our brothers and taking the lead, even if it is never again possible for pioneers to return here to help us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 36,666</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we read of the exemplary hospitality shown to the Christian missionary, the apostle Paul, when shipwrecked on the island of Malta, one would expect to find there today an active congregation of modern Christian witnesses, and there had been one until the mid-part of this year, when the majority of publishers, wives of servicemen, were scheduled to leave this island and return to England. Would there still be a congregation in Malta? The one Maltese brother in the congregation, who was appointed as congregation servant, wrote, “Malta will not be left without publishers in His service. In fact, another person of goodwill is also willing to go out on the work.” And so began the start of an almost new congregation with but four publishers. This brother writes: “The progress we made was with Maltese. I started two studies and now there are ten, seven of which are regular. And two of them have begun to talk about it to friends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the brothers were thrilled to see the newsreel report of the London assembly in the local cinema, the Around-the-World Assemblies did not stop at Malta. “Since this month was a month of assemblies, I gave two public talks, one in English and the other in Maltese. This is because we felt that we should have an assembly of our own. In attendance we had twenty, some Scots, Dutch, English and ten Maltese. We certainly thank Jehovah for his countless blessings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BURMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 20,054,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Burma are forging ahead even though the increase in the land is not great. The high point of the past year was, without doubt, the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Rangoon. The brothers there greatly appreciated the visit of the Society’s officers and the brothers who came there from many foreign lands. As the branch servant put it: “People now have proof that this is not a small organization confined to Burma, but that we have brothers in all parts of the world.” The convention certainly stimulated the interest on the part of the public in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, and Jehovah’s witnesses themselves were greatly encouraged and blessed and will push ahead now preaching the good news in all parts of Burma. Here are some interesting experiences from that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work is going ahead among the Telegu people in southern Burma. These persons love to hear the truth and are very humble. Many of them realize that their pastors are false shepherds. One church there is split into two groups, and studies are being held with members of both groups. A special pioneer tells how he gave a talk in a church with seventeen persons in attendance. All seventeen present at that talk are now having studies in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font7"> booklet in Telegu, which, apart from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font7"> tract, is the only publication we have in that language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another person of goodwill from this same area told a special pioneer that in a monthly magazine published by the Baptist Church it said that Jehovah’s witnesses are No. 1 Christians and that the Baptists pay just lip service to God. The woman said she could see the difference for herself and she felt that God had sent Jehovah’s witnesses to her and she was happy to receive the truth from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of our most fruitful fields in Burma is a remote Lushai village in the northwest. A special pioneer writes: “When I got to Tahan it was just an isolated group. Four months later, when the circuit servant visited us, a congregation was recommended and later established. Three years have passed, and I recall Jesus’ words at John 10:27, ‘My sheep listen to my voice . . . and they follow me.’ During these three years, with Jehovah’s help, I was able to help ten people to take their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“My most outstanding experience was with a young lad who worshiped the spirits. It was in 1960 that I met him in the door-to-door work. I called back and a study was started. Two months later I spoke to him about the field service and was successful in getting him to join me. Now he is regular at meetings and service. He gives student talks, presents good sermons and conducts Bible studies of his own. One with whom he studies has even progressed to the point where he is a regular meeting attender and a publisher of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Being poor, he has to spend his school holidays working in the hills and earning money to pay his own way through school. While up there, he takes care of his ministry, stirs up quite a lot of interest and gets good results. To get his report back to the congregation he has to walk many miles, but he never fails to do this. It demanded real effort on his part to save enough money to attend the ‘Everlasting Good News’ Assembly in Rangoon, and I was overjoyed when Jehovah blessed his efforts and he was able to be there. At this grand event he made a public declaration of his faith by water baptism. Now this one-time spirit worshiper has joined the ranks of worshipers of Jehovah and praisers of his holy name.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Our brothers in Cameroun have heeded Jesus’ words at Matthew 7:7 to “keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find.” They have been seeking truth. They have been going to meetings and have been preaching the good news. The results have been gratifying, for they enjoyed a very fine increase in publishers during the past service year. The overseers and special pioneers are also seeking, and they have found further truth through their attendance at the Kingdom Ministry School. Now they are ready to take on greater responsibilities in helping the congregations. The branch servant tells us about some interesting things that have occurred in this country.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The most joyful event of the year was the visit of Brother Henschel in March. We could not meet in a large assembly, but arrangements were made so every congregation in Douala was able to hear his encouraging talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Patient calling back even when little initial interest is demonstrated can result in an experience like this one reported by a regular pioneer: “An elderly lady in my territory would not speak to Jehovah’s witnesses. However, whenever we met I would greet her. One day I greeted her as usual and asked her if she knew of the one who had created me. She replied that it was God. ‘But,’ I replied, ‘do you know his name?’ Her interest was aroused and regular studies were held in her home over a period of almost four years. She made slow progress, as she smoked a pipe and this was a stumbling block to her advancement. After one of the regular studies I spent ten minutes explaining the advantages and Scripturalness of clean living. Her new personality was manifested when she stopped smoking and brought her broken pipe to me. Now she is a very active publisher, and although she is old, she never misses congregation meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children can be fearless praisers of Jehovah too. One circuit servant reported: “A family was making much progress in the truth, until the law regarding blood was considered during a study. The husband accepted this clear truth without difficulty, but his wife said: ‘If the wicked will be destroyed at Armageddon for eating animals killed by strangling, then I willingly accept death.’ All efforts to make her see the unreasonableness of her course were futile. One day the overseer visited the family along with his four-year-old daughter. The friendly woman who ate blood invited the child into her kitchen. There she served one kind of meat to her husband, who abstained from blood, and presented the child with a plate of meat from an animal that had been strangled, along with some cooked bananas. Seeing this, the four-year-old child stood up and with righteous indignation said: ‘What! Do you still eat strangled meat? I do not eat blood.’ The others politely suggested that she eat only the bananas. Touched by the child’s firm stand for godly principles, the woman immediately left her plate of meat, never again to eat blood. Today she is an active preacher of the good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Returning to unassigned territory year after year has caused some people to see that we are unselfishly interested in their welfare. One congregation writes: “The chief of a neighboring fishing port welcomed us, providing lodging and food. The people of the village were invited to hear a public lecture the following day. News of our arrival reached a priest who was stationed twelve miles from the port, and he visited the village in an effort to cause us trouble. However, when he arrived the chief told him: ‘We do not want you. Jehovah’s witnesses have been supplying us with spiritual food from time to time. Where have you been? Is it only today that you have come to know that people live in this port? Please get yourself prepared and here are men to ferry you back.’ The sheep recognize the Shepherd’s voice and know he will care regularly for their spiritual needs.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada have given the greatest witness as far as hours spent in the field service are concerned in the history of the work in Canada. They spent 5,775,431 hours preaching the good news. They also conducted more Bible studies in the homes of the people during the year than at any previous time. Still there was very little increase in the gathering together of the “other sheep.” There were, on the average, only 191 more publishers in the field each month than during the 1962 service year. Still, there were 1,391 persons baptized. Are those coming into the truth brought to maturity? Are those in the truth for years fully appreciating their responsibilities? These are questions Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere must answer. We must be “filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness” (Acts 4:31) just as much today as were the apostles in their day. Here are some experiences that have been received from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazines are still doing much to break down prejudice. This was Illustrated in the experience of one sister who had the door slammed in her face by a rude Catholic woman. Later on, another pioneer sister called at the same home, but talked with the man of the house. He was curious about the magazines, so accepted the offer. When the return call was made the woman answered the door, but what a change in her! She wanted more magazines and was full of questions. A Bible study was started in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font7"> Soon she admitted that she had learned more than in all her years at church. She humbly apologized for the way she had treated the other pioneer, so on the next call the two pioneers went together and all three at the study had a fine time. The pioneer who began the study found it necessary to move; so the sister who originally had the door slammed in her face is the one now continuing to conduct the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of one public talk on people of a right heart is seen in the experience of a couple who were willing to have a study in their home and progressed to the point of attending the public meetings. One of the talks discussed marriage. At the next study the couple explained that they were not legally married. They wanted to know what to do; so Scriptural counsel was given them. Although some of the legal matters that had to be cleared up in Europe took much time, money and patience, still this couple held to what they knew to be right. Eventually it was the privilege of the ones conducting this study to be the witnesses to the legal marriage for this couple. The following Saturday it was the further privilege of these publishers to take the couple into the field service for the first time. The Scriptures do indeed set things straight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A home Bible study was discontinued twice, first because the woman’s husband laid down the ultimatum that she choose between the studies and him, and second because when she later resumed the studies in someone else’s home he threatened to take the children away from her. At this the special pioneer sister who was conducting the study offered to speak to the husband on the matter. A five-hour discussion with him brought the concession that the wife could study if she wished, but that he would never be interested. He even attended some meetings with her, but insisted he would never be interested. All went well until the wife explained to him her desire to make a dedication. He was very angry at this and said that she could not be one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that she was not to go to any more meetings. The special pioneer relates, “She explained to him that she had to dedicate her life, otherwise she did not want to live. . . . When the day came for the immersion, she got up and got breakfast, but her husband would not let her eat anything and took her money away from her. He told her if she went she was not to come home. She went anyway. After the immersion a couple of friends took her home. She found her husband had packed his clothes and had left! This couple stayed with her for a while. Soon her husband came back. The couple talked with him, but he would only insist that the Witnesses had broken up his home; so the publishers left. The next morning the husband was at their door. He apologized for his conduct and asked the brother to study with him.” How pleased and happy this newly dedicated one is that she continued to study and pursued the right course as an example to her husband!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CEYLON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,644,809</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Ceylon have shared in a very favorable season of witnessing during the past service year. It seems that the brothers have taken full advantage of the fine opportunity they have to study and attend meetings and they have arranged their affairs so as to have a good share in the Kingdom service. There were 109 persons from Ceylon who arranged to go to New Delhi for the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, and this was a climax to their service year. They were able to meet with their brothers from other lands and enjoy their fellowship. Here are some experiences as reported by the branch office in Ceylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Promptly contacting interested persons when they move is rewarding. A brother who did this reports: “We received a letter telling us that a lady who had studied with the Witnesses for quite a few years was moving to a village about ten miles from our home. Without delay we visited her, and what a welcome she gave us! Her keen interest in the Bible did not have time to wane, as arrangements were made to continue right on with the study she was having. On one occasion there was a visitor in the room where we usually had the study. We wondered if she would want to put off the study. How pleased we were to see her coming with her Bible and book! To the visitor she said: ‘Now we are going to have a Bible study. You are welcome to join us. Otherwise don’t disturb us.’ He excused himself and we had the study. The next logical step was to invite her in the service. This we did, and she has been a regular publisher since. When we told her of the ‘Everlasting Good News’ Assembly in New Delhi, she at once decided she would like to attend. She put the matter to her husband, who agreed to finance her trip. Before leaving for the assembly we spoke to her about baptism. She told us she was planning to be baptized at the assembly. So now, after several years of patient effort on the part of many brothers who kept in contact with her as she moved from place to place, she is a dedicated sister and her two children have also shared in the ministry some.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vacation pioneering is convincing both to those sharing in it and to those who hear the message because of it. “While vacation pioneering I called back where magazines had been placed at a Catholic home. The youngest child was sent to tell me there was no one at home. I called again to be told the same thing. The third time I found the man at home. He told me that the church had warned them to be careful of people coming around talking about God and then condemning the Roman Catholics, as such are antichrists. ‘How do I know you are not an antichrist?’ I took my Catholic Bible and showed him. Soon he called the children, saying, ‘Come, come and listen to this lady; she is reading from the Catholic Bible.’ By using this Bible on following visits all objections were overcome and a study was started, with the family of six sitting in. Their appreciation of Bible truths grew rapidly and the three oldest children began attending meetings and joining in field service despite the public denouncement by the priest. They rejoice that they are now free, ‘like frogs released from a dark well,’ as the oldest son expressed it. This son was among those who were immersed at the assembly in Delhi. Two others want to be baptized at our next assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,098,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,144 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,576</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of runaway inflation and very adverse weather—the worst winter since 1845—the brothers in Chile made good gains in theocratic activity during the past year. One thing that has been emphasized has been study, not only for the brothers, but among the people of goodwill. They have had to keep in mind the words of Paul: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:16) Anyone who follows out all the admonition given in this text will certainly keep himself busy finding out what the will of God is for him and then doing it, and at the same time he will be helping others to know what God’s will is. With this in mind the branch servant sends in some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two special pioneers sent to an assignment in the south reported the case of a lady who vowed to wear brown all her life. At first she refused the offer of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book because of having her own religion, Roman Catholic. Her attitude changed, however, and she took it when the pioneer showed her the bottom paragraph on page seven, which says, “This book is not put out to fight against other religions . . . but to tell you truthfully just what the Bible teaches.” A study was started on the return visit in the presence of images and “saints” with lighted candles before them. Several studies passed with nothing said about this practice till she, herself, finally asked what the Bible said about images, as she believed in them and every day for twenty-five years had placed candles before them. She agreed to the suggestion that they wait to consider the matter when it would be taken up in two weeks on page seventy-seven. A good basis had been laid in the previous studies, so after the study on images she recognized and made the necessary changes to give God exclusive devotion. Instead of buying candles and images, she buys </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> to learn true worship. She and her niece soon became regular attenders at the Kingdom Hall, and in their first month of service placed fifty-eight magazines between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Patience and confidence in Jehovah despite opposition in the home bring results when persons of goodwill listen to the lifesaving truths that are taught. At a study conducted by a sister, as the wife’s interest grew, the opposition of the husband, who did not attend, increased. Fortunately, one day the publisher had the opportunity to speak to the husband on the bus to explain the purpose of the study, and from then on he allowed the study to continue with his family. In spite of repeated invitations, however, the housewife was too afraid to attend meetings. After some time, during the circuit servant’s visit, the publisher encouraged her to ask permission, saying that in matters of worship that affect her life and that of her children it was necessary to be subject to Jehovah’s commands and not man's. Courageously she asked and permission was granted, so that from then on she attended all the meetings. To get her away from the local congregation, the husband arranged to move to a city in another country. Undaunted, she wrote the Branch for the Kingdom Hall address there, and was overjoyed to find that their new home would be in the same block. Since then she and her oldest son have progressed to dedication and baptism, and the husband too has changed his attitude toward the preaching work. Jehovah rewards those who patiently teach proper subjection and those who listen to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We had a very fine report out of China this year. It was the release of Brother Harold King after four and a half years of imprisonment for preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Communist China. His report appeared in the Society’s magazines. We have just had recent information that Brother Stanley Jones is alive and healthy, but he still has more time to serve in prison in China. We understand that he is in the same prison cell now that Brother King was in and that he is doing quite well. As to our other brothers in China, we know little about them. Some literature has been sent to a few we know are still reading. We can only hope and pray that Jehovah’s spirit will rest upon them and that they will continue to walk in integrity. The doors of Communist China for the present are closed to witnessing publicly concerning God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COLOMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;15,097,640</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,038 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,970</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Colombia are certainly a growing organization. For the last seven years they have had over a 20-percent increase every year. The importance of regular weekly service has been kept before the brothers throughout the year in accord with Paul’s thought: “But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, ... in order that you may ... be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. 6:11,12) The branch servant says that when the servants set the right example the publishers will show zeal for the service. Here are some interesting experiences from Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A goodwill person’s husband first objected to her studying in their apartment. She said she would study somewhere else then. More objections when she started attending meetings and then going in the service were likewise overcome. Then came the real obstacle. The wife could not leave their invalid, nine-year-old daughter, a polio victim, alone. A “real” obstacle? Not at all! For several months now she has been a regular publisher progressively expanding her service activity to include all features of the preaching work. She carries her daughter in her arms to the meetings and in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did you know that we have a waiting list of territories to be opened up? Take the city of M----, near</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the Venezuelan border, for example. Two congregation publishers had moved there and were doing what they could in the service but they needed help. A special pioneer couple was sent there, and the first circuit servant’s report stated: “After three months they have up to forty-one people coming along and it’s a good, lively group. Also, there are five publishers in the village. The pioneer is a kind, humble brother and in the few months that he has been here the work has received a good name, even though the church has a big campaign to get all other religions out of the city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding B----, a Pacific coast seaport, the circuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">servant reports: “The atmosphere in the city is perfect for the rapid expansion of a group. Witnessing is a pleasure. It is so easy to go from house to house. The church offers no opposition at all. One of Sister C’s calls showed the magazines to the bishop who said: ‘I wish more people in the city would read something upbuilding like that.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of brothers were at the airport in Bar-ranquilla on July 2 when a chartered airliner took off with 84 delegates to the New York assembly, part of a group of 115 that made the trip. What they saw and heard is still being talked about here in Colombia. In fact, it is being seen also, because a Movietone newsreel has been shown in theaters with some good glimpses of the assembly in New York along with a favorable commentary in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO BEPUBUC (Brazzaville)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 812 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;810,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 998</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A knowledge of the truth has a powerful effect on those who love righteousness. Sometimes it requires great changes in their lives when the customs and traditions of the land are different from what is taught in the Bible. During the past year in the Congo Republic a number of persons have legalized their marriage to one mate. This has been done before civil authorities. They are now happily serving Jehovah God in purity. This action on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses has brought forth much favorable comment on the work they are doing, especially in the north of the republic where polygamy and wife-stealing are prevalent, even among nominal Christians. Africa presents its problems, but nothing so great that the Scriptures cannot give the answers. Herewith are some experiences that were sent in by the branch servant in Brazzaville. They cover the Congo Republic, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Gabon and the Republic of Tchad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother writes: “While attending meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses I often heard of what was called 'vacation pioneering.’ After having become a publisher and qualified for this form of service, I spent a month seeing if it would really be as enjoyable and profitable as I had been told. Was it? As a publisher I had never been able to establish a continuing Bible study, but in the one month I pioneered I was able to establish eight home Bible studies, and these have continued to progress since I returned to the congregation publisher ranks. Never will I hesitate to take up the vacation pioneer service when the opportunity again presents itself to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The high point of the year was the visit of Brother Henschel to the Congo. His practical suggestions and encouraging admonition have been a stimulus to the brothers, and the points he brought out have remained firmly fixed in their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five brothers were aided to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Milan, Italy. The brothers not privileged to attend have benefited greatly by hearing the detailed accounts the brothers rendered after their return. All wish to thank their brothers in other lands for the generous contributions that made the trip possible, and all express the desire to continue without letup the announcing of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 635 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,800,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,835</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although poor in material goods, brothers from the “bush” in the interior of the country have shown a keen appreciation for assemblies, although attending often means traveling great distances on foot under a blazing equatorial sun. One elderly brother trudged along for 135 miles to reach the assembly city, taking an entire week for the trip. This brother has been lame from birth, and made the whole journey limping along on a cane. His big smile indicated how happy he was to be present. Both coming to the assembly and returning home, he enjoyed many fine experiences preaching in villages along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Loving patience and good conduct on the part of a wife can deeply impress a husband, as this experience shows: Following the death of his wife shortly after their marriage, a man, in accordance with local custom, demanded of her parents another wife in replacement. The family, unwilling to refuse, gave the younger sister of the deceased woman to him. Not long after the marriage the young wife learned the truth and began actively participating in theocratic activities. Now came violent persecution from her husband, even to the extent of threatening her at knife point. But, putting her trust in Jehovah, this young sister refused to give up her faith despite atrocious mistreatment. Her Christian conduct and wifely subjection could not be overlooked by her husband, who finally stated: “Here I become furious with you and accuse you of all manner of things, and yet you never lose your temper and reply angrily. Where did you learn such conduct? Is that what your religion is teaching you? I’m going along with you today to see what you are learning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With his wife he attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, appropriately on the subject of marriage, and, stupefied to learn of the strict adherence by Jehovah’s witnesses to Bible principles of morality, he apologized to his wife for having often accused her of adultery. Since that Sunday he has accompanied his wife to all the meetings, and is actively studying God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Youthful ministers attending school can give a powerful witness for Jehovah by standing fast for truth. In one village the school director summoned all students to be present at a local celebration. Required to be there, several young witnesses of Jehovah were present when the national flag was draped in front of the audience and students were told to sing and dance in front of it. The young brothers steadfastly refused to participate in this idolatrous act, and had occasion to explain Scripturally their position to more than a thousand persons gathered there. Although beaten, they would not compromise. Their firm stand for their beliefs caused many present to ask for further information, and much good interest has been found as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;425,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 58 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,328</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the very beginning of the service year political friction between this republic and a neighboring state burst into violence. Many nonnationals were expelled from the country. All the special pioneers working in the two largest cities and the circuit servant, being foreigners, were driven forcibly from their assignments, narrowly escaping injury. However, their loving aid had strengthened the brothers, and fine progress has been made during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young man living next door to one of the service centers of the congregation in Port-Gentil noted with admiration the intense ministerial activity and fine conduct of the publishers. One evening, at the close of the weekly book study, he approached the study conductor who was leaving for his home. He said: “I want to come along with you people, but how much do you ask for one to be admitted to your organization?” Using Scriptural support, the study conductor explained that true Christians are happy to give free, and that no money whatsoever is demanded. A fine witness respecting Jehovah’s purpose for man and the earth was given. The young man was happy to attend a public discourse at the Kingdom Hall, and since that time has not missed a single meeting. He expresses the desire to imitate the activity and manner of conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses and is making good progress to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF TCHAD Population: 2,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 112,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The small group of publishers located in the capital city of this large republic zealously continue to proclaim the good news to all. The majority of the publishers are from other countries, and during the year three brothers and their wives returned to their home territories. Despite being fewer in number, the remaining brothers continued talking to others about their hope. Realizing the importance of stimulating interest, the brothers have stressed the back-call and Bible study activity, and are presently conducting, on an average, well over one study per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently the brothers were happy to receive the visit of a circuit servant returning from the Milan “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. All were overjoyed to profit from the encouraging spiritual instruction and counsel poured out at that convention. The circuit servant reports that there is much interest in the city of For-Lamy, but the brothers, all French-speaking, find it impossible to get the message across effectively to the large Arab population. Many publications have been distributed, however, and we pray Jehovah’s blessing upon the seed that has been sown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO (Leopoldville) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 14,150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,448 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,792</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For many years Jehovah’s witnesses have tried to preach the good news in the territory of the Belgian Congo, now known as the Congo. Many reports on this matter have appeared in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> over the years. Now excellent progress is being made since the opening of the branch office in Leopoldville some years ago. It is a joy to see how the work has moved forward since that time. Many are now taking hold of the truth. We should not scorn the day of small beginnings, for if something is truth it will prosper and grow, and that is what has happened in Leopoldville and the rest of the Congo during the past year. Let us hear the story of the work that has been done there during the 1963 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1932 the Society tried to send some Witnesses to carry on the work in the Congo, then a Belgian colony, but these efforts proved unsuccessful. The Belgian government confused the Witnesses with a political-religious native group who called themselves “Kitawala.” This local religion is a mixture of Catholic, Protestant and pagan ideas and also the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses. Considering the African way, this is not surprising because beliefs of the Catholic religion and Protestant religions have been adopted into another political-religious sect named “Kibangist.” The Salvation Army saw also their beliefs changed and adopted by some local groups. But these orthodox religions were authorized by the Belgian government to work freely. During this time the Witnesses, not being allowed to work in the Congo, were not able to justify their position, and their religious adversaries did not hesitate to stir up and maintain the confusion of identity between Jehovah’s witnesses and the Kitawala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, if the adversaries hindered the foreign Witnesses from entering the Congo to supervise the work there, they did not stop the truth from infiltrating there and progressing, from a small beginning in 1947 of one publisher, to 475 in 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The major event in 1958 was the tolerance the Belgian government granted the Witnesses after recognizing how different they were from these political-religious sects. Since then Jehovah has granted numberless blessings to these Witnesses in the Congo, and Jehovah’s witnesses have increased to 2,402 publishers. Nevertheless, many people are still confusing the Witnesses with these local groups and some of these are still using the names of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association, and profess to represent these organizations while having no authority to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to fundamental law, which serves actually as a bill of rights, the Congo enjoys freedom of religion and conscience, but since a great number of schools are taught by missions of different religions the parents and children often have to fight for their faith. Several children were expelled from school because they do not attend the religious services at the church. On this matter an interesting experience is reported by a brother: His young son was expelled from the school; so he wrote the teacher expressing his appreciation for the efforts made by the teacher to give instruction to his son, but he also explained that, according to the Bible and the law of the country, he as the father was responsible for the religious education of his son and that he could not allow his son to practice another religion than the one he chose. A few days later the teacher came to the home of the brother and tried to cause a division in the family, saying to the wife, “Look, if you let your husband give orders to your children you will be in difficulties.” But the wife, also being in the truth, gave a Biblical answer on the rights of parents. Afterward the teacher agreed for the boy to continue his schooling and that he could receive religious training at home by his parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two big events of the year were the visit of Brother Henschel and the attendance of fifteen Congolese brothers at the assembly in Milan. Brother Henschel had occasion to speak to three different meetings in Leopoldville, with a total attendance of 2,815.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not all persons have the opportunity to come into direct contact with the truth; so how are they to hear? When the homes of interested people cannot be reached directly such persons can hear the truth by correspondence. This happened in the case of a young man living near Bakwanga in the Congo. This man received a copy of one of the publications of the Society and read it with interest. He realized that the many unfavorable stories he had heard about Jehovah’s witnesses from Catholic sources were merely lies, and of these he said, “These ministers of Satan try perhaps to turn men from the truth.” His interest in the truth led him to write a letter to the Society’s branch office, sending money for additional publications. Having received the literature with much appreciation, he is now studying to have his many Bible questions answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,325,155</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The good news of the Kingdom has been preached in Costa Rica for over fifty years and very fine progress has been made, especially during the last two decades. The brothers there continually pushed ahead, advancing true worship throughout the country, and now they have reaped fine results. During the 1963 service year four additional groups began reporting, four more congregations were organized and now there are seventy-nine congregations in this land. A goodly number of our brothers in Costa Rica were able to attend one of the “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies, and they rejoiced in their association with their brothers and sisters from many other lands. The acting branch servant has sent in a few experiences telling about the things that are going on in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer relates an experience that shows the power of the truth to attract sincere persons and free them from the shackles of false religious bondage: “In an isolated village in my assignment a woman served as religious instructor for the people, even acting as priest, for she prayed the rosary in the church and said prayers over those who were dying. This woman heard of Jehovah’s witnesses, that they teach that God has a name and that his kingdom has been established in the heavens. She became so interested in learning more about Jehovah’s witnesses that she traveled quite a distance to the home of a Witness to find out when I would return to the village. It turned out that she waited there fifteen days. When I got around to that isolated territory again, what a joy it was to find this person of goodwill and be able to hear and answer her sincere questions on the Bible. She was so impressed with the truth that she then said she also wanted to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The following day I invited her to go along with me to see how we preach from house to house, and she was happy to go along. Quickly the entire village heard about it and some were very resentful. One person mockingly cried out: ‘Mama Chevita, teach us the rosary.’ But she replied: ‘No, I will not teach you those things any more, for I was teaching lies. Now I want to teach you the truth.’ And that is exactly what she is now doing, but as a regular baptized publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant’s wife along with several brothers was working in a small rural village. Upon coming to a certain house the brothers informed her that the householder was very opposed and on occasions had even run the Witnesses off her property. Because of this the brothers were somewhat reluctant to call on the householder. However, the circuit servant’s wife reasoned that she did not know the householder and that she had never been mistreated by her. So she went ahead and made the call, determined to do all she could to arouse the householder’s interest. She not only was able to give the sermon but also offer the subscription, which the man of the house gladly accepted. Though they have always been staunch Catholics, they are now regular readers of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,466,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 16,161 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 400</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even though our brothers are going through many hardships, they have reached new peaks in publishers throughout all of Cuba. In spite of the fact that the missionaries that the Society had there for years have been expelled from the country, the work continues to go on. Our brothers have taken their stand, and they “keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.” It is good to know of their zeal and determination to preach the “everlasting good news” and to comfort those who mourn. Here are some reports that have come out of Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstanding in this service year are the new peaks reached in home Bible studies, hours, pioneers and publishers. This excellent work, however, was not made without violent opposition by the enemy. Following the denunciation of some religious groups, including Jehovah’s witnesses, by the prime minister, Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz, in his speech of March 13 of this year, a flood of opposition swept the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of brothers were arrested because of their preaching activity; many special pioneers were forced to leave their assignments and many others were arrested and stood trial because they gathered to study the Bible without the permission asked by the local authorities. In some trials brothers were condemned to twenty days in jail; in other places they were ordered to pay twenty to forty dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the provinces of Las Villas and Oriente brothers were arrested even in their own homes and accused of having illegal meetings, with the only ones there being their own families. In the province of Pinar del Rio there was a flood of inspections requiring the congregations to be registered as associations and, after fining many congregations’ servants, 95 percent of the Kingdom Halls were closed by an official resolution, the properties were confiscated and the activity of the brothers declared illegal. Representations have been made to try to get permission to reopen the halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many trials are under way and arrests occur every day because, as the authorities say, “ ‘Proselytism’ cannot be tolerated.” They have told responsible brothers that all religious activities have to be confined to the interior of the temples and they will not permit preaching outside of them. Despite these conditions and all the opposition many good experiences have been enjoyed by the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of 1963 a letter was received in the branch from a girl of fifteen, who said in part: “I was raised in the Baptist Church, but now all my family are atheists and they want me to be as they are. Recently I read the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font7"> and I believe that you have the truth. Please send somebody to my house to help me, but be careful because my family is opposed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two persons came and talked with her about one hour and instructed her in how to deal with her family. She is now sharing in the preaching work and waiting for the opportunity to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible says that those who trust in Jehovah do not have to be afraid of their enemies and this is well illustrated by the following experience. A sister received a call from her daughters living in the U.S.A. They were afraid that something might happen to her. After the telephone call the sister wrote a letter to her daughters. In the letter she said: “You called me the other day because you were worried about me and your father; let me tell you something: I am a dedicated servant of God. I know what that means, but despite anything that may happen to me, I know that Jehovah can reward me. I am here and I think this is my place; I am resolved to maintain my integrity to my God. But, my dear daughters, there is something that worries me and it is that both of you still have not decided to serve Jehovah; really that is something to be worried about in this critical time of distress. I as a mother feel more worried about you there without the protection of Jehovah than about us here. Please do not forget my counsel, and follow Jehovah.” As a result of this letter both daughters of this sister are now studying the Bible and attending the meetings of a nearby congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">People with the spirit of the world do not like individuals with the spirit of the truth. While Jehovah’s witnesses are in the world, they cannot be a part of it, but they must follow out the command of Christ Jesus to preach the good news of God’s kingdom no matter what occurs. Jehovah’s witnesses cannot stop preaching the good news of the Kingdom because of threats, or even sometimes bodily harm. Despite some very severe opposition during the year the work in Cyprus has moved ahead well, and here are some of the things that took place there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On February 7, people in Famagusta awoke to see the main streets full of slogans against Jehovah’s witnesses, while opposite brothers’ shops and houses symbols of death—bones and skulls—were painted. On February 3 a priest, assisted by a mob of youngsters, beat three of Jehovah’s witnesses, father, mother and daughter, in a village near Nicosia because they went there to preach the good news of the Kingdom. He was brought before the court by the police and was fined £8. He denied all the charges before the court and falsely accused the brothers of denouncing Archbishop Makarios, the president of Cyprus. How true are the words of Jesus that this class of people are the seed of the Devil, the originator of lies and violence! In most of the Greek villages of the Papho district, the brothers were not able to preach because theologians gave instructions to the youngsters that as soon as they noticed Jehovah’s witnesses in the village, they should ring the bell of the church, create a mob and then chase them out of the village, destroying their vehicles. Brothers experienced many very narrow escapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had an interview last October with the assistant president, a very sincere gentleman, who assured us that they are condemning this religious intolerance and that they will do everything they can to stop this situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The highlight of the service year was our “Everlasting Good News” Assembly from August 8 to 11 in a beautiful hall that the brothers built with the help of the Society. It was really the best assembly we ever had and we must thank you, Brother Knorr, for arranging this assembly for us and for sending us four mature brothers from Great Britain and Canada to help us on the program. We had delegates from ten different countries abroad: Greece, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Italy, Sudan, and so forth, and an association that the brothers will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,585,256</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 11,002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 417</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are now the third-largest religious group in Denmark, but it can be said of them that they are first in activity. The Lutheran State Church has come out openly against Jehovah’s witnesses, trying to slow down their efforts. They have urged their people not to listen to the message that God’s people bring to them. One of the Lutheran clergymen announced at a press conference recently that he was going to make a motion picture unveiling Jehovah’s witnesses. It will be interesting to see if in his unveiling he tells the truth about them. The branch office in Copenhagen looks after the work in Denmark, Faroe Islands and Greenland, and here are some of the reports of the year’s activity from these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even if there seems to be no possibility of getting visible results from our service, we should not give up. Two sisters who have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> study with a ninety-year-old lady contemplated giving up the study; no real results could possibly be attained, they reasoned. The old lady, however, was always well prepared, happy for the study, and often expressed her conviction that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth, and so the sisters chose to continue the study, and their decision was blessed. Relatives of the lady noticed the love and care shown her by the two sisters, and as time went by (the study had now continued for three years) one of the relatives, a daughter, agreed to have a study herself, and now</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">her daughter is also studying. A third relative was so impressed by the example he had seen that he once stood up at a gathering to defend Jehovah’s witnesses, telling of the love and patience shown by the two sisters to his grandmother. “Would you do the same good work?” he asked the opposers. The faithfulness of the two sisters did bring forth results. Three relatives showed interest, and studies were started with two of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a publisher works the same territory again and again, the householders get acquainted with the publisher. One sister who was working her individual territory in this way was one day approached on the stairs by a lady who asked: “May I be so curious as to ask, Are you not one of Jehovah’s witnesses? My nextdoor neighbor and I discussed whethei' you are paid for the work or not. We know that you have two small boys and a house to keep, so we wonder how you manage to do it all.” This gave the sister an opportunity to witness to the lady, which had not been possible before. After the conversation the lady wanted to have the two latest magazines and also two copies for her next-door neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The counsel given by the Society about inviting others in the household to share in the study is very valuable and has already helped many persons of goodwill. One publisher had for some time conducted a study with a young man. Then the young man married, and for the first time the study was to be held in his new home. The big question was whether his wife would join him in the study. While she was in the kitchen, the publisher suggested to the husband that they should invite his wife to take part in the study. The young man and his grandfather, who was also present, both vigorously advised that such an invitation should not be made because the wife, as they pointed out, was strongly opposed to the truth. The publisher, however, chose to follow the suggestion given in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font7"> When the wife entered the room, he said to her: “I have brought a book for you too as I thought you would like to see what your husband is interested in. Then you will also be able to help him out of it, if you find that we teach him something wrong.” She accepted the invitation. The next time the study was conducted, she was thoroughly prepared and gave more comments during the study than her husband. The following Sunday both of them came to the public talk and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study in the Kingdom Hall. The next time she attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study she gave several comments, and this she has done ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have both attended their first circuit assembly, the young man has started in the field service, and his wife will soon follow him. She is very thankful that the publisher invited her to share in the study the first time it was held in her new home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FAROE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,596</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,193</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One climax of the year was the circuit assembly in Thorshavn in January. From thirty-two on Friday night the attendance climbed to fifty-five for the public talk. One of the many new ones was a fisherman. His sister, a Faroese publisher, had previously given him the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book as a gift, and, being a fisherman, he took it along on the boat and read it there. He wrote his sister very enthusiastically and told her that he had been delighted to read the fine book. “This is the first time I really see what the meaning of life is. You have the truth. Please send more literature.” She is now sending him </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and answers all his questions through letter writing. At the same time he is studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> by himself. He just happened to be in Thorshavn the Friday the circuit assembly began, and through the effective advertising of the assembly he got to know of it and came. He liked the program so well that he decided to stay for the whole assembly, although he had to make a telephone call to one of the other islands telling some relatives that he would not visit them as planned but would stay in Thorshavn until Monday. This he did, and he really enjoyed being with the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the real climax of the service year was the international assembly in Stockholm. A delegation of twenty-four from the Faroe Islands were happy to be present. The contributions to the convention travel fund made it possible to help the special pioneers to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GREENLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,312</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,287</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers who moved to Greenland to serve where the need is great have shown faith by not withdrawing. It certainly takes faith to serve here. Isolation, rough and primitive conditions, an extremely difficult language, and the Greenlanders’ feeling of discrimination between them and the Danes constitute a real test for these brothers. But they have proved to be of the right kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the sisters relates that two young men came to her house and just said: “We visit.” She invited them in and managed to ask a few questions in Greenlandic. She got to know their names and where they came from, but when they explained why they came to her house, she could not understand them. She sent for her husband and he played some Kingdom songs for them on the tape recorder and told them that he and his family were Jehovah’s witnesses. By means of the pictures in the Danish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and a few texts from the Greenlandic Bible they gave a witness. The young men were impressed by the beautiful book, and each of them wanted to have a copy of it next Friday. (Wages are paid on Friday.) When the sister asked one of them if he had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> Bible, he said: &quot;No, but on Friday I would like to have a copy of—what did you call it?” So you see, the publishers have a big work to do to help such persons out of darkness into the light of God’s Word. It takes faith and courage to do this work, but we are happy that there are such brothers in Greenland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,070,108</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,155 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,524</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Great is the joy of the brothers in the Dominican Republic because there has been fine, continuous growth since freedom to carry on the work has been granted again. Jehovah’s witnesses feel like the psalmist when he sang to Jehovah of his land: “There is a drenching of its furrows, a leveling off of its clods; with copious showers you soften it; you bless its very sprouts. You have crowned the year with your goodness.” (Ps. 65: 10, 11) The branch servant there says that their territory is like a well-sown field that has only waited for gentle rains to make it blossom. Here are some experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servants have done fine work in opening up and developing interest in isolated territories. One circuit servant and his wife arrived at a small town only to find that the publisher they expected to locate had moved. Told of another interested person six miles out of town, they set out on foot over roads almost impassable with mud. Finally reaching the home to which they were directed, they found a young boy in his teens who had identified himself as a Witness even during the years of the ban. Now he was helping two other youths to share with him in witnessing and they were conducting five home Bible studies with good interest resulting. Encouraged by the visit, he now reports regularly to the branch office, plans to be baptized at the next assembly and then vacation pioneer with one of the units in the capital to gain experience and ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How many studies can a mother of eight small children conduct, especially when she lives in rural hill country where rains sometimes flood roads and bridges ? A sister in isolated territory shows what can be done. She begins at home, rising early each morning and taking her eight children with her to her little out-ofdoors kitchen, where, while she builds her wood fire, she has one of the older boys read a chapter from the Hebrew Scriptures and then another read a chapter from the Greek Scriptures while the others listen. The day’s text and discussion follow. Is that all? No, in addition to this home instruction, each week she walks long distances to conduct some ten Bible studies, and at the last circuit servant’s visit she had the joy of seeing some begin publishing. On visiting the branch office for the first time to obtain counsel on a family matter that threatened to curtail her activity, tears welled up in her eyes at the mere thought of having to discontinue even some of her studies. Really, how could any publisher ever hold back from conducting a regular home Bible study just to avoid being “tied down”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York assembly crowned the year for us. Never before had more than two or three Dominican brothers been able to work their way past the web of government restrictions to attend an international assembly. How grand, then, to see a Dominican delegation of over eighty in attendance! Of those helped to attend, one pioneer sold his bicycle and another his typewriter and a sewing machine in order that their wives might go too. The feelings of all were well expressed by a schoolteacher who attended, though only having begun to study three months before. Before the assembly’s end she said, “If it had cost $1,000 it would have well been worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ECUADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,520,430</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,164 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 3,884</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is good for God’s people to keep always in mind the writings of Jehovah, and our brothers in Ecuador have remembered the words: “All day long I will bless you, and I will praise your name to time indefinite, even forever.” (Ps. 145:2) This they have endeavored to do during the past service year, with very good results. The year 1963 was the first time that the publishers of the good news in Ecuador passed the 1,000 mark in total publishers engaged in the ministry. They do rejoice in this blessing from Jehovah. Here are some of the experiences sent in by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher in ill health who was confined to a sanitorium for an extended period of time wasted no time in talking to others about Jehovah’s purposes. A study was started with a young man, but, because of religious pressure from within the hospital, he stopped visiting the brother. After some weeks, the young man returned and inquired about the meaning of a certain scripture that the priest could not satisfactorily explain to him. So satisfied was he with the explanation that he resumed his studies despite the protest of others in his ward. He made considerable progress during the few weeks of study, but the time came for his release. The question now was, How could this person be cared for, as he was returning to his home in an area isolated from any contact with a congregation? The brother was determined to do all possible to aid him, so arrangements were made to continue to study by mail. Systematically, by means of correspondence, the brother assigned him portions to study in a Bible-study aid, along with specific questions on the material assigned. Through correspondence the student would provide the answers and give a scripture or two in support of his answers, and in this way manifested his getting the sense of the Scriptures. When correction and further explanation were necessary, the brother gave such. The result after a few months of this ‘correspondence course’ is that the young man is now energetically speaking to his neighbors about the promised blessings of God’s kingdom. He is now planning on attending his first assembly with baptism in view. Love for the “sheep” impels Jehovah’s servants to go to great lengths in feeding them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Courage and strong faith are required to weather religious intimidation and opposition. In a gold-mining town a small, newly formed group of publishers was encountering considerable opposition from the local priest, he doing all he could to make trouble, even to the extent of inciting the youths to throw stones at the Witnesses at every opportunity. The meetings at that time were held in the home of a special pioneer. The priest approached the owner, offering to pay the rent if he would put the pioneer out, which he did. The actions of the priest just made the little group more determined. A family of goodwill exclaimed, “We won’t let you be pushed out of this town! You must stay and help us! We will build a Kingdom Hall along with an apartment for you on our lot.” While the Kingdom Hall was under construction, the neighbor remarked, “It looks like the only way to get rid of Jehovah’s witnesses is to burn them out, and that is just what we intend to do.” However, it so happened that a week later the house of the scoffing neighbor caught fire and burned to the ground. Happily the wind was blowing the fire away from the newly constructed Kingdom Hall so that it was not harmed. When the Kingdom Hall was inaugurated they had forty in attendance and a peak of publishers was reported that month. Courage in the face of religious intimidation brings rewards!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Faithfulness in service prompts the Kingdom minister to be thorough in all the details of the ministry. At the beginning of the service year a brother faithfully followed through with the suggestion of calling on all “not-at-homes” encountered the Sunday previous before continuing on with more territory. He met a man who manifested considerable interest in the message, although opposed at that time by his wife and family. Within four months, after a series of studies, he made up his mind to serve Jehovah. He first had to have his marriage legalized and was baptized shortly after. His fine example and determination astonished his wife and family so much that his wife, formerly a zealous Catholic, accepted the truth. Then his aunt, at the age of sixty-three, after a period of study, cleared the religious pictures and images out of her home, accepted the truth and is now one of the most active publishers of the congregation, dedicating an average of thirty hours a month to the ministry. Previously she never went out at night, but now never misses a meeting, rain or shine. Now from the two families there are seven publishers, and all this largely due to calling back faithfully on the “not-at-homes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,814,703</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 246 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,442</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark202"></a>It takes fortitude to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Eire, and those that have this quality did enjoy good fruitage from their labors of love during the past year. The brothers in this Catholic-dominated country show deep gratitude to Jehovah God for the blessings upon their efforts, for there has been an ingathering, and for the first time in quite a number of years they enjoyed a 10-percent increase. The outstanding feature of the report is the great increase in the number of hours devoted to the field service. There were 20,000 more hours devoted to the field ministry than during the 1962 service year. Or, stated otherwise, they put in 142,329 hours preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Eire. As time goes on, we feel sure the vacation pioneer work will take hold in Eire too and we will have not only special pioneers there, but regular pioneers. Here is what the branch servant tells us about the country.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Intimidation has long been used as one of the basic weapons to prevent the people of Eire from embracing the truth of God’s Word and becoming dedicated servants of Jehovah. However, courageous individuals with faith in Jehovah are manifesting themselves. One of such is a lady who has served for some time as a caretaker of premises belonging to a religious institution. Having acquired knowledge and understanding over a considerable period of time and enjoyed association with Jehovah’s witnesses, she desired to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah by being baptized at an approaching circuit assembly. When the clergy learned of this, they sent someone around to tell her that if she went ahead with this decision she would be obliged to leave her employment and accommodation. Her husband, who is not in the truth yet does not hinder her in any way, was opposed to her being intimidated and suggested that, if it was her wish to be baptized, she should go ahead and realize her desire. Courageously facing the situation, this person went to the assembly and resolutely followed through on her determination and was baptized. Since her return as a dedicated and baptized servant of Jehovah, no comments have been made, no questions asked, and she has been politely treated. Certainly Jehovah’s blessing will be with those who do not “shrink back” but “have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one assignment in a rural area two special pioneers were using a caravan or house trailer as their living quarters. After being away for a weekend, the special pioneers returned to find the trailer overturned, with considerable damage to one of its sides. The police were notified. They made investigation, tracked down the young men responsible and brought them to court. Reporting on the case, the newspapers said: “The charge is that between May 31st. and June 5th. they did unlawfully and maliciously commit damage, injury and spoil to and upon a caravan, the property of the Watchtower Bible Society of Dublin.” The five men involved were compelled to pay for the damage done. In addition to the newspapers, radio and television also gave publicity to the case, just stating the facts without bias. So we are glad that representatives of the &quot;superior authorities” are acting in defense of the property of those considered an “unpopular minority.” The preaching of the good news continues without interference in this area where the incident took place.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The “everlasting good news” was preached to more and more people in El Salvador during the past service year. It proved to be one of the country’s finest years of service. Many new ones joined in the proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom and showed their faith by their good works. The experiences submitted by the branch office are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While working from house to house during the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign I met a man who seemed to be waiting for someone to bring him the truth. He invited me in and listened intently to my sermon but said that he could not take the subscriptions at that time but would take the magazines. He asked me to call back and I did, but did not find him at home. This happened several weeks in a row, but finally I met him on the street one day. Since it was nearing the time for the Memorial celebration, I invited him to attend, stressing the importance of this meeting. The man came and was so impressed that immediately after the talk he came to me and took the two subscriptions. From this time on, a regular study was arranged in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font7"> booklet, and since I told him of the importance of all the meetings he has not missed one. He progressed rapidly and soon we were nearing the end of the booklet. One day in the middle of our study he interrupted me and said that he had to make a confession. What was it? He said that he had secretly made a promise to Jehovah to change his life completely and to dedicate his life to Jehovah’s service. What a pleasant surprise when he told me he was determined to get baptized at the next convention! Of course, the road was not that easy, because his wife and ten children were all Catholics and were opposed to his getting baptized as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. One of his older daughters said that she was going to have her priest come over to talk him out of this foolish notion. The man said he would permit it only if the discussion were based on the Bible. The priest came, but my student was ready for him with his family present. He spoke first, saying, ‘As long as the agreement is that our discussion be based on the Bible, it would be proper to start with prayer.’ This he did. After finishing the prayer the priest congratulated him for his nice prayer and said that it was a shame he had left the church and that he should come back because he could do a lot of good for the Catholics. My student replied, ‘Do you know where I learned to pray and gained my knowledge of the Bible? Not in the Catholic church but from Jehovah’s witnesses, and with these people I am going to remain.’ At that the priest got up without saying a word and left. The wife and daughter were deeply impressed with the way he answered the priest. Now he is baptized, has opened his home for a service center, is dedicating more than fifty hours a month in service, conducting five Bible studies and averages over fifty magazines a month. Surely this is the kind of faith that ‘preserves alive the soul.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The determination of some of the ones with whom Bible studies are conducted to progress and to share their knowledge with others can be seen by this experience told by a special pioneer: “A married couple and a young boy with whom I conduct a Bible study were very desirous that their opposed parents learn the truth too. My student said, ‘I noticed that the first thing my parents look for when they come over to visit is something to read. If I don’t have anything in sight, they look other places without asking permission. Recently, when I knew they were coming over, I put all the worldly magazines and newspapers under lock and key and put the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines and several of the Society’s books in the places where I usually kept the other magazines and then waited for their reaction. When they did arrive they looked all over the dining room, living room and bedroom but didn’t find anything but the Society’s literature, and so to my surprise they began to read what was available.’ When I called for my next study they told me what they had done, and the wife said excitedly, ‘And this is the way they too have come to hear about Jehovah and who his witnesses are.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;427,851</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There has been a healthy increase in the number of publishers throughout the South Pacific and the islands that come under the direction of the branch office in Fiji. Some new congregations have been formed on new islands, and all of this causes God’s people to rejoice, for it means the opening up of new territory. There is still a real need for brothers who are anxious to go where help can be used. Many of the islands of the South Pacific can use additional assistance. The people are a joy to work among and help in gaining a knowledge of the truth. Brothers from all the islands under the branch office in Fiji were able to get to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly held in Suva, and what a grand time they all had! Here are some experiences from these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We should attempt to start a study on the first call where possible. A pioneer called on a lady who received her kindly and showed interest. Some time later, the pioneer called again on the same lady. After some back-calls a study was started. The goodwill lady made rapid progress and after a few studies said, “You know, if you had asked me to study like this before I would have said ‘Yes’ right at the start. But I thought that your method of work was just to call and have a short talk with people every few weeks!” After three months’ study the lady and her family started associating with the isolated group in their town. Six months later she was going from house to house along with her seventeen-year-old son and servant girl. Now a new congregation has been formed and they rejoice in their privilege of taking the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Fiji had a wonderful year of blessings. They witnessed the marvelous effects the Suva “Everlasting Good News” Assembly had on the public. Who would have dreamed 1,080 would attend the public talk, 600 being persons of goodwill, some coming as far as 85 miles to hear the public talk? With the large number of Witnesses in town from so many countries, a big impression was made in the minds of Suva residents. They now had irrevocable evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses have a solidly established organization in existence here. And how uplifting it was for all the island brothers of the nine territories under the branch to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of fellowship with the around-the-world delegates!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having Brothers Franz and Suiter in attendance and other members of the anointed was a profound experience for these humble brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Remaining steadfast under family opposition brought great joy to a publisher when one of his family also took his stand for the truth. In 1955, five months after symbolizing his dedication, a young publisher was forced by his family to leave home owing to their opposition. Hoping that some members of the family might still have open minds toward the truth, this young man continued to make friendly visits on the family. After he married he was able to make more regular visits home. He and his wife began to discuss the truth with one of his brothers. They were cautious because of the family’s attitude. Some months later a circuit assembly was held at a nearby village so the brother was invited to attend. He was very impressed with the subjects discussed, and a study was started. The family’s opposition resumed. He was told not to go to the home of his Witness brother nor to have anything to do with the brothers. He was threatened that he, too, would be put out of the family. He was not discouraged, nor was his keen interest lessened. The opposition only made him resolutely cling to the truth. He began telling others of the truths he learned. Six months later he turned in his first field service report. In his determination to worship aright, although still attending school, he took a part-time job to save money to pay his fare to the assembly in Fiji. This he did and, to the great joy of his fleshly brother, he there symbolized his dedication to Jehovah by being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW CALEDONIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72,500</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">For some years now the brothers have been experiencing difficulties due to the ban placed on all the Society’s publications by the local authorities. Imagine their joy when, early in the service year, the Society won a court action in Paris and the Privy Council removed the ban from all the publications, excepting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> The brothers greatly appreciated this victory for true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been rapid increase in the congregation. This has brought problems, as there are few mature brothers to train all the new ones. A new group center was organized with only one brother and one sister capable of engaging in the ministry. However, many new ones were attending the studies and wanting to begin the ministry. The conductor set to work with a will. He scheduled time after each group study to instruct the new ones in presenting simplified sermons. Then before each meeting for field service he had them rehearse the sermons. The results: after six months the service center had sixteen regular publishers capable of presenting sermons at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GILBERT AND ELLICE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46,119</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,588</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These two groups of islands, although hundreds of miles apart, are all under one colonial administration, with headquarters at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. Some years ago a few Ellice Islanders who had learned the truth in Fiji moved back to these islands, and so the work began. Also, a few years ago a family from New Zealand moved to the Gilbert Islands to serve where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A person of goodwill, after brief association with the brothers in Fiji, returned to the Ellice Islands. He had sufficient knowledge about baptism to refuse permission for any of his children to be baptized by the London Missionary Society. This was a great disappointment to both the minister of this church and his wife. Over the years he stood by his decision in this matter. This year he was contacted again by the brothers. Immediately he requested four studies a week. He took steps to see that his children were brought up theocratically, studying with them himself at home and taking them to meetings. When his wife fell ill, good opportunity arose for some sisters to speak to her about the blessings of God’s new order. Due to the fine example her husband set in rearing the children in the truth, she has taken up a study of the Bible too. The man’s father, on hearing all of this, began to deal harshly with him. The son replied, “From when I was small until now that I am a man with a wife and children, you never taught me the way to go. You never did teach us from the Bible. But Jehovah’s witnesses have done so. I do not want my children to be brought up in the same way that I was, without Bible education. I want to train them in God’s Word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53,700</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A solid foundation for future increase was laid during the year with the arrival of a new family of four publishers to serve where the need is great. This makes six publishers now working in the territory, and the added encouragement of this family has resulted in much increase in the activity of the group in the town of Vila. During the visit of the circuit servant ninety-four people attended a screening of one of the Society’s films, although it was not publicly advertised and limited invitations were extended only to those interested in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is need here for a married couple who are able to speak French or have the ability to learn this tongue in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NIUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,885</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The brothers have been experiencing opposition from other religions that have spread false stories about the Witnesses’ beliefs and have gone so far as to threaten with jailing anyone taking an interest in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One clergyman requested a brother to come to his home to mend his broken motorcycle. Although the brother knew little about motors, he went along to see what he could do, as it might be an opportunity to explain the truth. This man had been one who strongly opposed the work. The opportunity came at once to witness when the clergyman asked how long the Witnesses have been a religion. The answer, “Since the days of Abel,” took this minister unaware; so a really deep Bible discussion followed. He said, “Never mind about the motorcycle; let’s talk about the truth.” In the end he admitted he thought his church knew more about the Bible than any other religion, but now he could see that that was not so. He also admitted that he had used articles from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines in his sermons. He requested that his son be taught by the Witnesses, and a study was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Legislative Assembly met to consider a request by the London Missionary Society Committee to stop the brothers from going from house to house. The Assembly commendably advised the committee that it was going to uphold the democratic right of freedom of worship. So the way is still open to preach from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TAHITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,550</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What a great blessing the new Kingdom Hall owned by the congregation is to the brothers! For years it had been a problem to And homes large enough to accommodate all who attend meetings. The brothers were able to purchase a fine block of land right near the heart of the city from a sister at a reasonable cost. They got together and worked on building the Kingdom Hall, even though they had only ninety dollars in hand. They were rewarded with a beautiful island-style hall, which will be completely paid for within a year. How glad they were to have this larger place to meet in, for just a few months after completion 198 attended the Memorial celebration! Now an average of ninety people attend meetings, which is high for a congregation of fifty publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Big changes have to be made in the lives of some to conform to Jehovah’s righteous standards. During forty-two years a mother bore fourteen children out of wedlock before finding the truth. She desired to serve Jehovah, but was greatly disappointed when she learned that this was not possible unless she straightened out her life, for she was then living with a man to whom she was not married. She decided this could be done, but then difficulties arose because all her children did not have the same surname. The matter had to be taken to court to be put in order. This process consumed a year’s time. When this was finally settled, she married the man. One month later she was baptized at the circuit assembly, along with one of her daughters. She has since shared in vacation pioneer service with her daughter. Her other children and grandchildren are also proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TONGA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,889</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in the 1930’s that a person of goodwill first heard the truth. Since then he has stayed by the things he learned and has spasmodically kept in contact with the Society. Over the years, through his incidental preaching, he became known as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In recent years visits by special representatives have enlarged this person’s understanding. Meetings were organized and these he faithfully kept going, even though he himself has never been to any other meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses. His incidental preaching and holding of meetings has now resulted in a total of nine publishers in Tonga, three of whom are dedicated and baptized. They are all Tongans. Due to restrictions made so far by the authorities no outside missionaries have been able to enter the country. As yet no one is serving where the need is great in these islands. The need is very great for mature, married couples to serve here to train the local brothers in the ministry and in organizational procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WESTERN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 70 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,571</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During this service year some pioneers were able to move to new areas to open up the work, two being assigned to the largest island in the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Working all homes, even though it is known that some householders are not favorably disposed to the message, can sometimes bring blessings. On approaching a house during magazine service one sister advised another, “Oh! It is a waste of time! We preached to them often, but they are real opposers of Jehovah. They never liked us.” So the two sisters passed up the house. However, one of the sisters became troubled about missing this home, and Paul’s counsel at 2 Timothy 2:25,26 kept passing through her mind. So the next afternoon after conducting a study in the same area, her conscience got the better of her and she called at the home. She found out that the sister was right. Only the woman of the family was home and at first she was very rude. However, the words of Paul just mentioned continued to encourage the sister, and, by remaining calm and friendly, she was eventually able to place a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">with the woman. She called again and started a study. The following week the husband joined the study. Now the whole family, including the children, join in the study. How glad this sister is that she did not fail to call at all homes in her territory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,547,937</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9,664 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 471</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The past service year saw the best publisher increase in Finland since 1959. There are so many things to be thankful for that have brought blessings to Jehovah’s people in that land. The “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Stockholm was attended by over four thousand Finnish brothers and sisters. They returned home very enthusiastic over the things they learned during that eight-day convention. All the special pioneers and many others expressed their appreciation for the financial assistance given to them to get to Stockholm. They showed their appreciation by turning in their best report of field service during the month of August following the assembly. The brothers there have their problems in working territory, just as there are problems in other parts of the earth, and the branch servant sends in some interesting experiences on the work during the 1963 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The severe northern winter presents many problems in getting to the more isolated parts of the territory, but with perseverance even hard-to-get-at places can be covered. In one congregation the brothers had not been able to travel to one isolated village during the winter, and so some publishers made plans to go there as soon as the thaw came in spring, even though no special interest had been manifested there earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Imagine their surprise when at the first house the householder complained, not that Jehovah’s witnesses come too often, but that they do not call often enough! “Where have you been?” the householder asked. “Have you forgotten us? Don’t you think we want to know about these things, too?” When they got to the next house, the reaction was the same, and so on at the other houses in this small settlement. The brothers were happily surprised and made good use of the opportunity to give an extended witness and leave literature at each house. Then, finally, they found out the reason for the sudden interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It all began when a study was started with a well-known family in a neighboring village. This family had a very good reputation as clean-living and cooperative neighbors, and when they began studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and later on the father and seventeen-year-old daughter started out in the field service, the villagers were all amazed at how well they knew their Bibles. One said, “That young girl preaches better than our minister!” The local Lutheran minister had founded a Bible study group, but it had broken up the previous summer because of internal dissension, and now the local people decided that Jehovah’s witnesses must have the truth because of the progress this family has made. The seventeenyear-old daughter was immersed at the Stockholm assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Age and physical disability are no barrier to Kingdom service if the desire is there. One blind brother who is confined to a home for the aged takes an active part in the ministry in spite of his handicap. Since he cannot read the Bible or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> himself, he asks different inmates to read to him, which they do. As he listens to their reading he tries to determine from the tone of voice whether they show any interest in the material or not, and so he makes opportunities to witness to them. He has also asked some of the attendants to read to him, and in this way he has found at least one interested person, who took a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> He takes advantage of every opportunity to talk to the people he meets as he walks around the grounds, and in this way he has been able to arrange for two studies to be started by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have you ever found it hard to answer the many questions that people of goodwill present? Then why not try using the magazines? That is what one newly interested person did, with excellent results. He became quite enthusiastic after a few Bible studies and began to speak about the truth while going about his work. He is a chimney cleaner and so has many opportunities to talk to the people in the various homes where he does cleaning. But the people asked him so many questions he could not answer, he became discouraged. The pioneers with whom he was studying suggested that he try leaving the magazines with those showing some interest, and he began to do this. The result was fifty-seven magazines placed in April, and on his next cleaning round he followed up the interest shown and offered later issues of the magazines. Now he has a cleaning round that is also a magazine route, with an average of 175 magazines placed a month over the last four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;47,650,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 20,367 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,340</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a joy it was for the brothers in France to learn that they reached a new peak of 20,367 publishers during the 1963 service year! France has a tremendous population and there is still much work to be done, but with this number of publishers engaging in the field service many more of the “sheep” will be found. Many of our brothers will engage in the vacation pioneer service during the year, and this will result in a greater witness. Others will get into the regular pioneer service, and eventually many will be prepared for special pioneer work; and we can use hundreds of these brothers and sisters in France to get out into the isolated sections and large cities that do not have publishers. The branch office in Paris looks after </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font8">great field. They not only interest themselves in France itself, but also during the year they gave attention to Algeria, Malagasy Republic, Republic of Mali, Reunion, Senegal Republic and Tunisia. Here are some very interesting experiences from all these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following report shows the good effect and the good witness given by the Christian conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses. A young woman was recently employed in a factory where a brother was also employed. She noticed that his conduct was beyond reproach and that he never used filthy language, in contrast with some of the other workers. One day she asked him an unexpected question: “Would you not be one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” Surprised and somewhat touched by this question, the brother replied “Yes” and was able to witness to her. Later she attended a public meeting. She stayed for the study that followed and agreed to a home Bible study conducted by a sister. She was temporarily separated from her husband who was overseas. She informed him of her joy of knowing the truth. Then the husband got his wife to rejoin him, and so now she keeps up her study by correspondence. In a recent letter she stated that, in spite of the opposition that she gets from those around her and the lack of interest on her husband’s side, she is persevering in the truth and desires to be able to serve the true God someday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother who is a waiter on a French liner witnesses whenever he has the opportunity. One day at breakfast a passenger declared: “Today is my birthday. When I got up this morning I thanked God for all that he had given me in life, for all I possess I owe to him.” Seeing that this man believed in God and had a heart condition not often found these days, the brother took advantage of the occasion to make him a gift of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,</span><span class="font7"> which he accepted with pleasure. The next day this man said to the brother: “You know, my wife and I stayed up till midnight reading your book. It is magnificent; it is wonderful to see how good God is. I am going to give this book a place of honor in my bookcase, but before doing so, I am going to keep up my reading of it attentively!” That same evening he said to the brother: “Good evening. I’ve had a good meal, but I am going to keep on eating, because I am going to read your book, and that will be my dessert!” This man has now returned to France and is progressing in the truth, thanks to a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certainly the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book is a wonderful instrument! A lady who was a catechist accepted this book from a sister who was a special pioneer. The sister used this book to reply to the lady’s questions concerning the Catholic religion. This lady now understood her responsibility and used the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book as her principal textbook for her job as catechist, finding this book “the most efficient.” Soon, however, she put an end to this equivocal situation by telling the priest that she was going to stop her militant Catholic activities. Shortly afterward she stopped going to church and replaced this church attendance by a Bible study with the whole of her family, seven persons in all. Six months later this lady was baptized, followed three months later by her husband and her son. In her zeal she spoke to her sister, who did not wait long before stopping her daughter’s visits to the catechist. The interview that she brought about between the priest and the witness of Jehovah opened her eyes to see the truth clearly, and soon she also got baptized, as well as her husband and her three daughters. Thus, the special pioneer’s small group of publishers quickly got an increase of ten new publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in France were highly enthusiastic at learning of the assemblies to be held in Munich and Milan, and at these some 11,000 attended. Many did not allow the language difficulty to stop them from engaging in the field service provided for at these assemblies. Others gave a fine incidental witness. One of the French brothers who went to the Munich assembly told how in the past he had spent five years in Bavaria as a prisoner of war. His life was often very miserable and the persons to whom they were assigned as prisoners of war were very hard. In 1942 he learned that his mother had been arrested in France by the Germans and had been deported to Ravensbruck, where she finally died as a result of blows she received and bad treatment. Thus a bitter hatred developed in his heart for that nation, and in 1945 he declared to those who had been put in charge of him that he would never return to that detested country. A few years later he learned the truth, which changed his life and his way of thinking. This brother returned to Germany in 1963, but this time it was to attend the Munich assembly. The place where he had been held prisoner in the past was not too far from Munich, and so it was possible for him to go and visit his former guardians or keepers. They did not feel very much at ease when they saw this ex-prisoner back again. They were very astonished when they heard him witness to them, showing that the violent hatred that he stored in his heart in times past had been banished by the truth, and that now he had come many miles in order to bring to them a proof of Christian love. Finally he was able to place with them the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> in German and he also had the joy of being asked by them to enter their names as subscribers for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ALGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 74 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 128,378</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since last year great changes have been brought about in this country where a struggle has been going on between Europeans and different extremist elements, sowing fear and destruction. Many Europeans have returned to France and the majority of the publishers have followed the exodus. Thus out of a force of 173 publishers there are now only 74 in Algeria. During the period when violence and crime were reigning, the work did not stop. The publishers were wise and zealous and had the opportunity to comfort many persons by announcing Jehovah’s purposes. Most of the brothers and sisters came out of this tribulation unscathed. The few brothers who remained were greatly encouraged by the pioneers who remained in their territory. When peace was restored, a reorganization was made and a regathering began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience was sent in by a pioneer. A sister placed the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book with a young lady and arranged to call back. On the return visit she was surprised to see seven persons waiting for her visit. The study was started and arrangements were made for a regular study. Very soon, however, the family left hurriedly because of the trouble in the country. The lady’s house was occupied by her sister, but the study was discontinued. However, the sister still continued to visit this person each week and to talk to her concerning the hope of God’s kingdom. One day this lady spoke to the sister about her husband who was Catholic. He had chosen the army as his career, and she told the sister of her fears. “You will see how I will receive Jehovah’s witnesses,” he had said to her. One day the husband came home during the sister’s visit, went to his room but left the door ajar intentionally. The sister finished her conversation with the wife and left without seeing the husband. The following week the sister came to see the lady, and the husband was there again, but this time he intervened in the conversation. He asked many questions and showed keen interest in the Bible. At the end of the conversation the man agreed to having a home Bible study and he asked to have a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book. The following day he had read the whole of the book and said, “This book has taught me many things.” Two months later he no longer attended church and was looking for a job because he had left the army. He found a job as a treasurer in a secondary school. Shortly afterward he went out in the field service. But the situation in Algeria obliged him to leave the country, and he again found himself without work. As soon as he arrived in France, this man contacted Jehovah’s witnesses so as to continue to receive instruction and to engage in the field service. He has also had the joy of giving the truth to the family with whom he is staying, and they are progressing in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Experiences show that children can serve Jehovah efficiently. A small girl of ten who is a regular publisher exceeds the average of ten hours per month and places an average of twenty-one magazines. She recently brought a girl of twelve to the service center study. In the one congregation in the Malagasy Republic, as a result of encouraging the young ones, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> the school-age publishers meeting the requirements became vacation pioneers. Of sixty-five publishers, nine became vacation pioneers, or 14 percent of the congregation. Meetings for field service were arranged each day, morning and afternoon, and the enthusiasm of these pioneers was stimulating to all the other publishers. It often happened that over twenty persons came to the meeting for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one family a child seemed to have no interest whatever for the truth. However, the father insisted that he attend the meetings in spite of the child’s indifference. This perseverance produced results. A young brother came to spend his vacation in the same locality as the family in question. The parents of the indifferent boy invited the brother to their home. There he had the occasion to speak kindly to the boy, and since he was almost of the same age he was able to make a great impression on the boy. Finally, the lad began to go out in the field service and then dedicated his life to Jehovah. He has now been in the pioneer work nine months, thus proving that the father did right in insisting on his attending the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Results are not always rapid, and perseverance is necessary in the back-call work. A sister who is a missionary obtained a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> from a lady and also placed a Bible with her. It was necessary to make many return calls before a study could be started. The lady never studied beforehand, and there were long discussions every time before the study could be started. But the truth was doing its work. The husband joined the study and the lady began to go out in the field service. Then they left to live on the island of Reunion, where the lady got baptized and became a vacation pioneer. Her husband also made a dedication to Jehovah. Three years passed from the time of the first visit until her baptism, but she was a person of goodwill and perseverance brought her into the fold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The field is vast and there are few workers in this country. Three special pioneers are working courageously trying to get the truth to penetrate this territory where Islam is the predominating religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer writes: “A goodwill Moslem who got a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book, which I placed with his friend, has become very interested. He is also reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to this study and in the light of the world events, he now believes in the Bible. Here is the letter I received from him recently: ‘It is with a heart swelling with joy that I write to you today to tell you how much I am fascinated by your mazagine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">This magazine constitutes, in truth, an inexhaustible source of knowledge of the true God. Since I began to read this magazine I keep thanking God for bringing it to my attention. I realize that your organization is the true one and leads in the way of salvation. I hope soon to be counted among Jehovah’s witnesses.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REUNION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;360,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 93 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,871</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is wonderful to see the progress in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom in this island when one stops to think that the witness first began to be given in January of 1961. Of the twelve months of the service year, eleven have seen new peaks in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first baptism service was held in December, when twenty persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah before witnesses. The second was held in June, when thirty-eight persons publicly symbolized their dedication before 220 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two congregations in the island and a third group of eight isolated publishers is being formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother Henschel’s visit was an important event, and in spite of the late meeting and lack of transport, 155 persons attended his discourse. During this visit arrangements were made for four special pioneers to help take care of the congregations and to work in those parts of the island where the good news had not yet been preached. One of the special pioneers is a father of seven children who has agreed to leave St. Denis to work where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before going out in the field service a young brother in the truth suggested to the brother responsible that they first visit his family, because, said he, “I cannot visit strangers if I have not first of all preached to my parents.” Thus he and his pioneer brother went to visit his family. Friends and neighbors quickly became interested and studies were started. The result of this initiative: today in that town there is a young congregation of sixteen publishers with great prospects for increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience shows the zeal of the publishers in this island. In December a young brother who is a teacher wrote to the Society to become a vacation pioneer. Since he had been publishing only three months, the congregation committee could not recommend him. Fully understanding the position, he declared: “It doesn’t matter. During my two vacation months I will work as if I were a vacation pioneer.” That is what he did. The two special pioneers cooperated with him during these two months. He did very good work, reaching an average of 112 hours per month and 70 return visits and establishing 14 home Bible studies. At the end of his vacation the overseer asked him: “Brother, how will you be able to care for your home Bible studies when you take up your secular work again?” “What shall I do? I will conduct them myself; two each evening, also on Thursday, and I shall still have time for the house-to-house work on Sunday morning.” As a result there exists today in that town a group of eight isolated publishers conducting thirty-two home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL Population: 3,200,000 Peak Publishers: 49 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 65,306</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year that has just finished proves once again that Jehovah is blessing his people. The service year began with thirty-three publishers and four special pioneers. With Jehovah’s help the brothers in Senegal were able to reach a new peak of forty-four publishers and five pioneers in February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Senegal give a listening ear to the message of the Kingdom. The occasions when the publishers are badly received are very rare; however, the people have a certain superstitious fear of religious conductors, who have a very great influence on their lives in every respect. Thus, in spite of the good number of Bible studies, very few persons make a stand for the truth. They follow the studies regularly, but when certain points are discussed on doctrine or when it comes to dedication, there is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> distinct drawing back. This is particularly true for those who practice polygamy. In spite of all difficulties, the truth is penetrating little by little and the name of Jehovah is becoming known in Senegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA Population: 4,000,000 Peak Publishers: 49 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to 81,633</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to difficulties that have arisen in this country, the work in some localities has suffered some setbacks, but it is encouraging to see the good spirit of the brothers with regard to the publishing of “this good news of the kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant sends in the following experience. “In 1956, while pioneering in France, I met a lady who was a subscriber for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> She said that she appreciated reading this magazine, but, being very busy, she did not always find the time. Furthermore, she was thinking of leaving soon to go with her husband to take up residence in Tunisia, her husband’s country. We had a long talk during which I presented the current sermon. She was a Baptist but was looking for the truth. I tried to make arrangements for a return call, but she said she had difficulties and made me understand that for the time being it was not possible for her to give time for the study of the Bible. Nevertheless, I called back to see her when her subscription expired some time later. She refused to renew her subscription, and added that she did not want to be visited again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In April, 1963, seven years later, while going from house to house in Tunis, I met a lady who listened to me attentively and she said that she knew of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. ‘Decidedly!’ she said, ‘wherever I go I meet them.’ She told me that while living in France she had been approached by Witnesses, and as our conversation progressed we came to the subject that we had discussed in France! She was astonished to have met me again, and was happy that I had called on her. She invited me in, took the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and agreed to have a study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 55,564,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses brought the 1963 service year to a grand climax in Germany. A circuit servant wrote and said: “Almost all the persons that we visited who had provided rooming accommodations were very, very enthusiastic about our gathering. On our back-calls they joyfully showed us correspondence carried on since the convention.” A person living in Munich wrote: “Dear Watchtower People: Many thanks for the lovely days that you provided for us in Munich. Although Catholic, I was on the field all day. The world convention is now over, but those were unforgettable days. Countless Catholics and also Lutherans were there.” So the convention had its effect in Munich and all of us can rejoice in that. Here are some experiences from the German branch office on Germany and also Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are still some areas where special pioneers are needed in order to direct the people of goodwill to the way of everlasting life. Special pioneers were assigned to such a territory three years ago and their efforts soon bore fruit. Interested persons were found with whom the brothers studied and who then were soon immersed. But still more publishers were needed in this territory. Soon a young married couple answered the call to serve where the need is great and joined the praisers of Jehovah there. The priest of the town felt obliged to pray that no more of Jehovah’s witnesses might enter the territory. The church members were encouraged to pray in the same manner. During this time our brothers were also praying, however. They prayed that still more persons might answer the call to serve where the need is great and come to their territory. Their sincere petition was heard, for soon another family joined the publisher group. On May 1, 1962, a congregation was organized. Soon it was seen that the brother’s home, which had been used for the meetings, was too small. The construction of a Kingdom Hall was decided upon, and on September 26, 1962, it was dedicated. What a joy for the brothers as they counted the number of persons in attendance—57! Now the congregation is thriving greatly with Jehovah’s rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience demonstrates how necessary it is to ‘go on bringing up one’s children in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.’ A mother was studying with her eleven-year-old daughter. Her five-year-old son sat in on the study. At a tender age the boy thus learned to conduct himself well and to avoid bad speech. Sometimes he goes over to the carpentry shop next door to watch the men working. But when he heard them use some improper expressions, he exclaimed that persons who talked that way “would not get into the new world.” Astonished, the workers asked him: “What do you think you know about a new world?” So he explained to them enthusiastically that his mother had a book that told all about it. One of the men asked if he could get such a book. The boy immediately ran home to get a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and then placed it with the man for the normal contribution. Since that time, he has continued to witness to grownups about his hope and is able to place many magazines with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BERLIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,175,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,400 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 403</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Berlin publishers can only carry on their ministry in the city itself, because of its island-like location in the midst of Communist East Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother invited one of his fellow employees to attend a public talk in the Kingdom Hall. It so happened that another employee heard him and asked if he could come along too. After the talk, the young man was very enthusiastic and asked the brother if he could also become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, since he had seen none in his neighborhood for a long time. The following Sunday he went along in the field service and that afternoon he attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. Two days later he went in the field service prior to the congregation book study. In addition to the home Bible study that is being conducted with him, he attends all the meetings and is continuing regularly to take part in the field ministry, reporting up to sixteen hours a month. He has also brought some interested persons to public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A district servant was going from door to door with a sister, and they met a student whose objections sounded more like those of an opposer. The district servant spoke to him and overcame his objections with the Bible. In the meantime, his brother, also a student, joined them and invited the publishers to come in. Both young men were astonished at the publishers’ Bible knowledge and wanted to know how it had been obtained. They showed them the publications of the Society and said that they too could obtain such knowledge by studying the publications with their Bible. So the students subscribed for both the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines. The congregation servant made a back-call, and soon a home Bible study was in progress. When the district servant arrived in Berlin six months after that, the two students met him at the airport themselves, and now they and their sister have symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by immersion in water. At present they are studying with their mother.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark204"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses had a very interesting year of service. In spite of the fact that nationalism is on the increase in Ghana the brothers pushed ahead with their work among the people. More pressure is being brought upon the brothers to take an interest in political affairs. The recent </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> articles on the “superior authorities” helped the brothers to maintain their neutral position and to seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness. There is much work yet to be done in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togoland and Upper Volta, and the branch office in Accra sends in some experiences from these places.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Witnessing to members of one’s family may require much patience, but can bring good results. A circuit servant said that at the time when he took his stand for the truth his brother wrote to him and protested strongly that he should stop his new faith since they were born Anglicans and their father was a catechist priest in the Anglican Church. Through correspondence the circuit servant encouraged his brother to read the Watch Tower Society’s publications, which would help him to understand the course he had taken. This only infuriated the opposing brother and he vowed that he would never read the publications nor would he welcome any letter telling him about them. The circuit servant relates an interesting account of what has happened since then. “Because of his strong protest, we discontinued writing to each other until in 1962, when I wrote him that I would like to spend my vacation with him. He accepted my request. My reason for visiting him was to talk to him about the truth, but since he was an opposer I was wondering by what means I could interest him. I made it a matter of prayer and one morning I approached him and told him that I had many talks to deliver in the congregations and asked him if he would mind copying some for me. He agreed. A few minutes after I left him, he came to me and said, ‘Is it true that those who eat blood by not draining animals before they are eaten will be cut off? My Bible says so,’ he added. This opened the way for me to witness to him. His last question to me was this, ‘Am I a good Christian if I violate the law on blood?’ I replied, No, quoting from the scriptures at Leviticus 17:10-15 and Acts 15:28, 29. A home Bible study was started as a result and he made rapid progress in the Scriptures during the week I spent with him. When I was leaving him, I left him to the care of the local brothers. In a few months’ time he wrote to me and said, ‘I have taken my stand on the side of Jehovah our God. Send me </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font7"> and a songbook. They will help me to increase my praise to Jehovah.’ He was baptized at our national assembly in March 1963 and hopes to pioneer one day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children can often create a favorable impression in the minds of householders who have not shown much interest in the Bible. A pioneer took along his eightyear-old daughter in field service and approached three women with the comment, “We bring you the good news of the kingdom of God.” One of the women replied, “Get out! We have no time!” The pioneer then remarked, “All right. My daughter would have been the speaker, but as you have no time, we are going.” The householder said, “This small child? Let her come.” The young sister warmly presented the current sermon and asked, &quot;Do you pray the Lord’s prayer?” to which the woman replied, “I surely do.” The young publisher asked the woman where that prayer was in the Bible, but the woman was unable to tell her. The small witness said, “You can read it in Matthew 6:9-13.” To the next question, “What is the personal name of our Father who is in heaven?” the woman answered, “God,” but it was made clear to her from the Bible that the name is Jehovah. By this time a number of persons had drawn near to listen to the conversation and the initial objection had been turned into a favorable impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The highlight of the year was our moving into the new Bethel home and branch office in Accra during March with the dedication taking place during Brother Henschel’s visit. It is located in a quiet residential area of Accra and is an ideal place in which to work as well as a very comfortable home for the Bethel family. We all want to express our appreciation for this grand provision that Jehovah has made through his organization and we want to show our appreciation by using the building to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The publishers in Ivory Coast have been very thankful to have received the help of two missionary couples during the service year. This service year saw the first national assembly held in Ivory Coast, and the brothers appreciated hearing the talks in their own language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The value of making personal calls on persons who write to the Society’s office for information about the organization is demonstrated by the following experience. A French family obtained a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book in France before moving to Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast. Upon their arrival they wrote to France to inquire if there were any of Jehovah’s witnesses in Abidjan. The Society asked one of the missionaries to call on this family and much interest was found. The family had many questions concerning the end of the world, and the missionary tactfully answered them by starting a study in the chapter in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book that covers this subject. Four weeks after the first contact was made they were attending congregation meetings. Here they heard field experiences and comments on the congregation activities. This moved the husband to take the lead in the conversation at the end of their weekly home Bible study; and he said, “I suppose we shouldn’t wait long before we get started in the service ourselves. At what hour do you go out in the morning on Sunday?” Since then, hardly a week has passed without their presence at all the meetings as well as their presence in the field service. They enjoyed a very happy weekend with the brothers at the recent circuit assembly and now they want to know what is required of one to get baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Working in unassigned territory helped a pioneer to appreciate that there are many people who are waiting to have someone come to teach them more about the Bible. The pioneer traveled seventy-four miles to this territory and planned to stay only three days. However, after working in the village for a few days he found that the people were very receptive, and the chief of the village pleaded with him to extend his stay to continue his teaching work because he was very happy with what he had learned. The chief had heard of Jehovah’s witnesses before but had never met any. He said that the priests had hid many things from them and he was very pleased that someone had at last come to teach them more about the Scriptures. The pioneer happily agreed to stay longer in the territory, and as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">result the chief called all the people of the village together so that they might all benefit from the good news from the Bible. After the talk the people expressed their appreciation for what they had heard and said, “We beg you Jehovah’s witnesses not to leave us. We have all seen that you are the only one teaching the right way in truth.” The pioneer writes that he will soon go back to that village again to give them more help.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At the end of June 1963 seven publishers from the Togoland Republic and Dahomey moved to Ouagadougou, the capital of Upper Volta, to seek employment and serve where the need is great. They were able to take a small supply of literature and magazines with them, and they were able to distribute most of these among the people in Ouagadougou in a very short time. The publishers are now having a good share in the back-call work and have started a number of Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The past year was an unusual one for our brothers in Greece. They were kept extremely busy making preparations for an assembly in addition to taking care of their regular service activity. They welcomed and guided many hundreds of visiting brothers who came from twenty-six different lands to Greece during the year. It was a year full of intense activity, excitement and tremendous pressure from the enemies of the truth, but it turned out to be a year of great joy to the brothers, climaxed by their association with their fellow workers who visited them in Greece. While the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly was not convened in Greece, the results of the assembly were still felt far and wide. Here is a report from the Branch on activities in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The witness given throughout the country by reason of the ways and means employed by the Greek Orthodox Church to cancel our assembly is truly amazing. Our brothers have now more opportunities to explain the truth by informing people of goodwill exactly how the events developed relative to our canceled assembly. With trust in Jehovah under all circumstances allowed by Him, we courageously keep on with the ministry of the “everlasting good news” in close cooperation with Jehovah’s holy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One publisher, while at work from door to door, placed a magazine with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> lady who showed a very good spirit and keen interest. On making a back-call, the publisher found no one at home. He called again, but was unable to meet this lady. The neighbors, who perceived what it was all about, gave no information to the brother. Ultimately, through other interested people living in the vicinity and unknown to the lady’s hostile neighbors, the publisher succeeded in meeting this housewife and arranging for a meeting at the home of the interested people, where the lady gladly came, attending a Bible study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book with great appreciation. She obtained other bound books, and five months later all her family attended congregational meetings and are now publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young sister who came to know the truth after graduating from high school and who dedicated herself to Jehovah’s service met with very hard opposition from her father. But this did not discourage the sister. She regularly attended meetings to edify herself in the faith. She kept trying to share the truth with her sisters. Two of them began to show interest and shortly accepted the truth. A little later, thanks to the wise course followed by this sister, her mother too came to a knowledge of the truth, and finally her two other sisters. The father remained alone in the family and continued to be very hostile, being influenced by his relatives and neighbors. However, during his visit to Athens, his daughter introduced him to brothers who took him to meetings, and finally the father also followed the way to salvation and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young girl, a witness of Jehovah just ten years old but well trained by her parents in the nurture and admonition of Jehovah, was stopped on her way home by a neighbor woman who laughed at her, saying: “You too are a Jehovite; you people do not attend church masses, and you are not Christians,” etc., etc. The little girl did not lose her courage but retorted to the lady that Jehovah’s witnesses are Christians, that they attend congregation meetings three times a week, and that they study the Gospel that tells about God’s kingdom. “Are you doing this?” asked the little girl of her neighbor. Then the lady changed her tone, and asked her to tell her mother to pay a call on her, which she did. Attending the discussion also were two young men who were tenants in the prejudiced lady’s home. A Bible study was arranged. Three months later the two young men, with what they learned up to that time, left for their village in central Greece and began telling their fellow villagers what they had learned. Care was taken for them to meet with a neighboring congregation, and now a great circle of interested people are attending home Bible studies. All this interest because</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of that ten-year-old little girl who was well trained by her theocratic parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is now a typical result of the cancellation of our assembly due to the clergy’s malicious steps. A sister who had a very opposed husband told the congregation servant that her husband entirely changed his course of conduct, daily following in the public press the clergy’s steps to have the gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses canceled. His conscience was stirred up by all this, and he finally told his wife: “Never more will I attend church after this unjust prohibition.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">All Kingdom publishers need faith, endurance and love to do the work commanded by Jesus. It takes much time and patience to aid new ones to appreciate the many wonderful truths in the Word of God. They must heed the words of the apostle Paul: “Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) In this French-speaking territory of Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Martinique, all Catholic territory, there have been some very interesting experiences to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When he was doing preaching from door to door, a special pioneer was greeted by the words: “Mister, do not go farther, because nobody here will accept that religion.” In answer the brother said to the lady: “If our religion is from the true God, we will find here also people who will serve him.” The brother took his words to heart and worked with faith and hard labor in that territory. One day as he passed by a work place someone called out: “You keep straight on, but you do not know if I am not a ‘sheep’!” The third time the brother met this man he was invited into his home, publications were placed and a study was arranged. After the first study the brother encouraged him with a sermon to attend the meeting the next day. He came and has been regular ever since. However, before the second study the man was discouraged and confused after a visit from a Seventh-day Adventist. A rendezvous was arranged with the Adventist, so the man could hear at the same time the sound of the two “bells.” The truth was made clear to him and he recognized the true sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This man had a big obstacle to overcome. He had a mistress and two children by her and she was awaiting a third one. But she did not want to hear about the truth. When the man explained to her that it would be necessary to get married because he desired to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, she said: “I prefer having twenty-five children without being married rather than accept that cursed religion.” As he showed much patience, she began to attend the study with her lover. Now she became persecuted by her parents. Her mother, who is a Catholic in practice, said that she could not tolerate having the Bible and other books in her house while she receives holy communion. (She never said anything to her daughter because of her having children with a man who was not her husband.) In spite of many difficulties the lady stood firm for the truth. A few months later the marriage was celebrated before the authorities and in the Kingdom Hall. After that event they began to preach from house to house, were baptized at the first circuit assembly and have become zealous Kingdom preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,505</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In 1958 a missionary went to French Guiana for three weeks to look after the interests of the work there. During the three weeks he placed seventy-five subscriptions. One of the subscribers for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> was opposed by his wife each time he brought the magazine home. Since it was being sent to his workshop, finally he stopped bringing it home. He renewed the subscription with two special pioneers who were preaching regularly in Cayenne, the capital city. Sometimes he went to the meetings, but secretly because of his wife. He wanted to keep peace at home, but he wondered how he could get his wife on the side of what he felt to be very good in view of what he had read in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was convinced that if his wife would read one single </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> she would continue to read the magazine. How to make her read the first one? That was the cpiestion! The opportunity came with the article “Finding Happiness in Marriage.” He brought the magazine home and in a manner that his wife could not help but notice, he put the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> in a place where she would see it during his absence. When he came home, he sensed that his wife had read the article on marriage, if not more, but she said nothing. From that time on the husband continued to bring a magazine home once in a while. The wife read all the magazines secretly. Sometimes her husband surprised her reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font7">but he acted as if he did not see anything. Finally a Bible study was established with the family. The wife was baptized last year and her husband this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This couple is now happy to have been awakened to the will of Jehovah God. Having put into practice the good counsel of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font7"> this couple has found more happiness in marriage. The year 1963 was certainly one of the happiest of their life, as they were delegates from French Guiana to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MARTINIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;292,062</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A pioneer met a man who showed much interest in the Word of God, but the man could not read. The brother made every effort to study with the woman living in the same house, despite her lack of interest, so the man would have a regular study. The parents of the lady loaded her with abuse, and she thought of stopping the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being unmarried, the man decided to stop living with his concubine; he had decided to walk with God. With tact, steadfastness and patience, the brother repeatedly encouraged the woman to continue with the study. He explained that learning the will of God does not mean to repudiate her parents. The time came when she understood that it is more important to please Jehovah God, according to Matthew 10:37, 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a child was born to her both resisted the bad influence of the parents and friends. The baby was not baptized according to the Catholic church, as the Bible does not teach baptism for babies. Now this couple is married, allowing them to share in the preaching work. Regularly they make known to others the way to get free from the bondage of Babylon the Great. Now they are waiting for the next assembly to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah by baptism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In this comely land of eternal spring Jehovah’s witnesses have been encouraged to construct their own Kingdom Halls. These Kingdom Halls, of course, help the brothers to take more interest in their place of meeting. It means they have a permanent location to which to invite those of goodwill. Right now two Kingdom Halls are under construction, and these will be a great help in expanding the witness in the territories where they are located. A good witness was given throughout the land this past service year, and here are a few experiences sent in from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Showing the need to take advantage of every opportunity to witness, one of our special pioneers working unassigned territory found himself preaching to a Protestant pastor. Our pioneer was then given the opportunity to witness to the local congregation that evening. Let our brother put things in his own words: “After the church collection had been taken the next pastor to speak took the platform and said, ‘Before I start my theme I want to tell you that we have present with us a brother, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and we would like him to give a testimony or an experience.’ For the next twenty minutes I took advantage of the offer and, using my Bible, I explained the hope of eternal life on earth. There were three pastors in the audience in front of me: One pastor to the left of me, one to the right of me and one in front of me. At the end of this eventful meeting one of the pastors invited the audience to take some literature that I had. Many in the audience said that they had no money. With that the pastor said, ‘That’s all right, you may use the money from the collection!’ ” So, brothers, you never know how things are going to turn out, do you? During this trip the pioneer brother placed 150 magazines, 40 books and 60 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The desire to tell others the good news is aptly illustrated in the following experience. A brother who was living in a coastal town and working on board a ship as a steward came to a knowledge of the truth because of the efforts of a special pioneer. Since he was not from this coastal town, he wished to take the truth to the town where he was born, as there was no organized w<sup>T</sup>ork being carried on there. He quit his job, took out a salesman’s license and moved home with his wife and two children. He established studies and waited to be contacted by a brother. When a special pioneer arrived, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and weekly book studies were started. The brother was then baptized during the circuit servant’s visit. There are now eight publishers in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HAITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,384,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,036 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,266</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Republic of Haiti has had another year of political and economic difficulties. In this small country of the Caribbean it seems that everyone is busy with politics, but Jehovah’s witnesses stick to their God-given work of preaching the good news. There were four Haitian brothers that received permission from the government to leave the country to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. This brought great joy to them, and they were able to take back a good report of the things they learned. Here is an experience that occurred during the year in Haiti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At one of our circuit assemblies a congregation servant from Port-au-Prince told the following experience: “For some time a brother conducted a home Bible study with a person of goodwill living near a Baptist church. The pastor lived next door, and on finding his neighbor was studying the Bible with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he paid a visit to tell his neighbor that the Witnesses are antichrist, that they don’t believe in Jesus and reject the trinity doctrine. As a result the student invited the brother to discuss these matters with the pastor. On arrival I was privileged to open the discussion, so I asked them if they believed that the Bible taught the doctrine of the trinity. They answered yes, so I quoted several scriptures showing that Jesus is not equal with the Father and consequently could not be God Almighty. In spite of the convincing scriptures, they still claimed to believe that Jesus was Almighty. So I asked them to read 1 John 4:15. At this the pastor grew enraged and brought the discussion to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Three months later while I was at a gas station someone called me. To my great surprise it was the assistant pastor, inquiring about the time of our meetings. I asked him why he wanted to know, and he replied, ‘From the day I read the scriptures you cited and after meditating on them, it became clear to me that there is only one God and he is greater than Christ.’ The following Sunday he was the first one present at the Kingdom Hall. A home Bible study was arranged, and when I arrived, the whole family was waiting for me. However, the study did not begin the first day, as the entire family believed in the doctrine of divine healing through faith. After discussing Matthew 24:24, 2 Thessalonians 2:9, and showing that Mark 16:9-20 was apocryphal according to the marginal notes of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Segond</span><span class="font7"> version, they agreed to study. From that day on their progress was evident and soon they joined me in the house-to-house work. At one of our circuit assemblies, this assistant pastor and his wife symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;640,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 319</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A joyous shout of praise ascended to Jehovah as many brothers from the several islands that make up the Hawaiian group gathered together at the grand assembly in Honolulu. The scripture comes to mind: “Let them attribute to Jehovah glory, and in the islands let them tell forth even his praise.” (Isa. 42:12) Everyone on the islands seemed happy, especially Jehovah’s witnesses, and here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is great value in having service centers conveniently located throughout the territory. A service center had been functioning for several years a short distance from the home of a sheeplike person. Very often she had been contacted by the Witnesses and was especially impressed by the effectiveness of many of the younger publishers. She noticed that nearly every morning the pioneers and publishers met at this particular home and carried on their activity from that point. One evening she went to this home and told the sister she was interested in Jehovah’s witnesses. After a long discussion the sister obtained four subscriptions and arranged for a Bible study. Just two days later the study began and a New World Translation Bible was placed. This person is progressing well, and she has proved the service centers in themselves serve to advertise Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother, realizing that the purpose of calling at the door is to give a witness, did not shrink back when seeing a crowd gathered and enjoyed this experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Another brother and I called at a home where there was a party of about sixteen persons enjoying themselves. The householder invited us in and, after orienting ourselves, I proceeded to give the sermon ‘God’s Name to Be Sanctified.’ After the sermon I presented the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified.’</span><span class="font7"> The householder agreed to take the book and so did four of her guests. Since we had only three books with us, we went in search of the other publishers to obtain two more. Upon returning to this house, two other persons had decided to get this bound book, for a total of seven books at this one house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are especially grateful, Brother Knorr, for having had the impressive “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Honolulu. There was excellent publicity on the largest group ever to convene in the islands. This has caused many who once closed their ears to the message of “everlasting good news” now to consider Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,949,858</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 709 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Paul said, “Let us press on to maturity,” he was not excluding any part of the earth as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned. Everyone must put forth an extraordinary effort to find out what the will of God is and then do it. A good example of advancing to maturity on the part of the brothers in Honduras is seen in the number of congregation publishers who are taking up vacation pioneer work. During the past year eightyeight took on this added privilege of service. Here is one of the experiences from the branch that is of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Central America one of the greatest obstacles to the advancement to maturity of many people is the fact that they are not married but just live together, usually with many children. Let us see how they are making the required steps to “press on to maturity.” In a little town, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">aldea,</span><span class="font7"> a sister working from house to house met a person of goodwill, a woman, who already had the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.” </span><span class="font7">A study was started, and from the start she showed real interest. However, she was living consensually, and the man opposed her studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, as he was a fanatic Catholic. He told her, “I do not want to see that Jehovah’s witness lady here again. If she does come back, something is going to happen.” This discouraged the person of goodwill somewhat, but the publisher, being alert, made arrangements to continue the study in the home of the goodwill person’s mother. After a few studies the woman wanted to know what else was required to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The importance of matrimony was discussed, and the woman was anxious to legalize her relationship with the man as she also had several children. He refused. Later, however, the Catholic church in the locality was encouraging all its members to marry if they had not already done so. The opposed “husband” then got an idea, “If I marry her in the church, then she will leave this other religion and be a ‘good’ Catholic again.” So they married. When she returned to her </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">aldea, </span><span class="font7">all her friends congratulated her because she had returned to be a “good” Catholic. This person of goodwill took advantage of the situation and said, “I am also very happy because this marriage is just what I needed in order to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses; now nothing can stop me.” Soon she was going out in the service when her opposed husband was at work. When she attended the Kingdom Hall for the first time her husband came in and threatened her, taking her out of the Kingdom Hall. Some days later she was baptized. Now she never missed a meeting, although upon returning each time he would hit her in the face and finally threatened her with death. With that she moved with the children, but he soon was begging her to come back, saying he would give her freedom of religion. When she did return, the congregation servant went and personally talked with him, showing him the position of his wife as a dedicated Christian and her obligations, such as meeting attendance, field service, and so forth. With this understanding his attitude changed, and he was invited to attend the meetings with his wife. He went, and was so impressed, not only with what he had learned but also with the warm greeting that he received, that he was moved to say, “Soon I will have to become a member also.” And so it was. Shortly afterward he asked for a Bible study and began to associate regularly. He has expressed his desire to be an active participant in the expanding New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 222 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 15,766</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong have kept very busy during the past year. Of course, the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Hong Kong was their greatest joy. Throughout the year they had a full share in the Kingdom proclamation. They spent more time in the field ministry than during any other year. They conducted more Bible studies, and even though they did not reach a new peak in publishers, the witness was given. The small band of Jehovah’s witnesses in Hong Kong have a great work to do among the three and a half million people now there, and the population continues to expand. Hong Kong is a beehive of activity, and Jehovah’s witnesses there are in the midst of it doing their God-given work. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother who works as a junior executive of a shipping company whose vessels trade in the Far East has been unable to join the rest of his brothers on Magazine Day, so he had poor magazine placements. He writes: “How to place my quota of magazines was something I kept turning over in my mind. Then an idea came. Why not offer the latest copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> to those in my office and to the masters of the ships when they are in port and come to the office? I took courage and each Saturday afternoon offered the magazines to my fellow workers. Results were excellent. During the past service year I placed an average of thirty magazines each month.” This brother’s effort to place his quota of magazines was richly blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Labor is plentiful and cheap in Hong Kong, resulting in many having to work very long hours. This poses a great problem to both publishers and goodwill persons, but those who use initiative and overcome the problem receive a blessing. One sister relates such an experience as follows: “About eight months ago I met a young man who showed good interest. He asked me to call quite late in the evening after he had finished his day’s work. This I did, and a study was started. He made fine progress and came to the point where he realized that he must attend the meetings. He approached his employer and asked if he could leave work earlier on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and this was made possible. From then on he made rapid progress in knowledge, came out in the service equipped with a new Bible and later a new briefcase. But the greatest joy of all was to see him symbolize his dedication at the ‘Everlasting Good News’ Assembly in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without doubt the crowning joy of our service year was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly and the presence of so many of our brothers from more than twenty lands. We here in Hong Kong count it a great joy and blessing to have worked and shared in the success of such an assembly, the grandest ever held in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In February this year two special pioneers were assigned to the Portuguese Colony of Macao on the edge of the China mainland. They have done good work and covered quite a portion of the territory. Being able to speak the local Chinese dialect, they have been able to meet many goodwill persons and study with them as well as obtain many subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> Five goodwill persons attended the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Hong Kong. A good start has been made, and it is hoped that some will share in the preaching work during the coming year. The field service activity for the two special pioneers is included in the Hong Kong report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister in Hong Kong tries to keep contact with a sister in China by way of her mother but with not too much success. When sending a parcel of candy and cakes to her mother, she packed a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book in Chinese among the candy. It got through to her mother in China and our sister was able to read it on occasions when she visited the house. It brought her great joy and she wrote a short letter saying how much she appreciated this morsel of spiritual food. It was evident from her letter that she continues to speak the truth under very restricted conditions, and she assures us she has not forgotten Jehovah’s goodness and the coming new order of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183,478</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 74 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,479</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Iceland is a cold, raw country, an island out in the middle of the North Atlantic. However, there are people there who are interested in knowing more about God’s Word. There has been a steady increase in those associating with Jehovah’s organization and it is a remarkable thing that in this cold climate the congregation publishers averaged 9.2 hours each month throughout the entire year. The branch servant there gives us a few good experiences that occurred there during the 1963 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s people in Iceland have had much to do this year, and they have experienced many blessings. The outstanding highlight of the year was when twenty-six or about one-third of the Witnesses traveled to continental Europe in order to attend some of the international assemblies there. Of course, such traveling takes a lot of time and is expensive, but we believe it was worth while to do so and thus be able to attend these grand spiritual feasts spread by our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, not all those having vacations used them traveling; quite a few tried out the vacation pioneer service this year. Among those who did so was the assistant congregation servant in the congregation of the capital, Reykjavik, together with his wife. Now, for quite a time he has had to be contented with just being able to recommend others for the vacation pioneer service, but this summer he decided to do differently. Having sold his small business, he combined his summer vacation with our circuit assembly, and then right after the assembly he drove out in the rurals as a vacation pioneer, together with his wife and three children, two of whom are publishers now. What joy they experienced! In just two weeks they managed to distribute 69 bound books, 103 booklets and 389 magazines, besides taking subscriptions and making back-calls in this widely scattered area where people often want to have you stay for hours! They were overjoyed when they came home, as were the girls, who had, despite their young age, reached more than twenty hours each! This was a very good example for the brothers, and a total of eleven brothers vacation pioneered over the year, or 16 percent of all the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 443,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 221,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the Chinese aggression on India’s northern border came as a shock to the nation, Jehovah’s witnesses had a comforting message to carry to the people. Glancing at the fine increase in India this past year, namely, 6 percent, one of the outstanding features was seen to be the home Bible study activity. While our brothers have plenty of territory in which to work, they are now facing a new problem and a big one. That problem is obtaining sufficient literature. The government has clamped down on all imports, restricting the importation of almost everything, including books, even when these are sent in as gifts. The branch office is working on this problem so that we can keep them supplied with English publications. All publications in local languages must be made in India itself. The Society is, of course, taking care of this matter and will do everything possible to aid our brothers in India to press on with this wonderful work of preaching the good news. The branch servant has sent in many interesting experiences, and here are a few that will warm our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A feature of work that is worthy of mention is the unassigned territory campaign conducted each year. Last year this campaign was organized with the idea of using the experiences had by the congregations to locate the most suitable locations for special pioneers. Previously special pioneers were assigned to big towns just because they were big, and sometimes without any real fruitage. This last year we asked for reports from the congregations that had worked unassigned territory to get a better idea of where there was likely to be good interest. A congregation reported good interest in a town thirty miles away, so, first, we asked a circuit servant and his wife to pioneer there for a few weeks in between serving their congregations, and they aroused much more interest. Then two special pioneers were assigned to the place, with the result that in less than two months they had three publishers reporting. These were prominent churchgoers, and one of them has now opened up her home for meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were some interesting experiences reported by teen-agers. A boy of twelve began to take interest in the Kingdom message and was baptized the following year. His parents did not show any interest, but his elder sister did. The parents began to make arrangements for the marriage of their daughter to a man not in the truth. The boy protested and told his parents that he would leave home if his sister was married to this man. The parents were impressed and eventually dropped the idea. Then some of the boy’s cousins began to take interest as a result of the lad’s witnessing, and two of these dedicated themselves to Jehovah and were baptized. Now the parents are also studying and attending meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The crowning feature of the year was, of course, the share we had in the “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies around the world. As the report on that outstanding event will probably have appeared elsewhere in greater detail, it may be sufficient now to say that it was a most stimulating pleasure to prepare for, and to receive, some 583 delegates from abroad traveling together on the Society’s tour, plus some who traveled independently, and 32 Gilead graduates who came to India from surrounding countries. For our Indian brothers it was a lifetime’s experience to have the opportunity of meeting so many brothers from other lands, all joining in united praise to Jehovah for the abundance of good things provided. Many of our Indian brothers living in the far south were unable to afford the 4,000-mile journey to Delhi and back, and they much appreciated the loving concern the Society had for them in arranging for an echo assembly in the south two weeks later, when almost the entire program at Delhi was duplicated for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A most interesting sequel to the Delhi assembly was a miniature echo assembly in Bombay arranged entirely by schoolchildren. It so happened that these children had a few days' holiday from school the week following the Delhi assembly, so what did they do but spend the time organizing an assembly of their own. Without any prompting from their parents they drew up a program for a two-day assembly, made speaking assignments and appointed servants for the departments, with a chairman and assembly servant. They had a bookstall, cafeteria, contribution box, toilet, signs, and even a small replica of the map of the world showing all the Society’s magazines and where these are printed, as at Delhi. This was taken from a school map with the magazines drawn in by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Considering that the oldest was only sixteen and the youngest speaker six years of age, they showed a remarkable grasp of the organizational features as well as of the subjects of the talks. There were seventeen children all together and the public meeting was taken by a boy of ten. Neighboring children were invited and the attendance at the public meeting was twenty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INDONESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 100,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 801 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 124,844</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A fine report comes in from Indonesia and the good news has been preached far and wide throughout the land. The pioneers and special pioneers are pushing the expansion and are reaching out into new fields. Some fine work has been done <a name="bookmark205"></a><a name="bookmark206"></a>there this past year, and here is a report from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By far the most outstanding event of the year was the international assembly in Bandung. Many difficulties attended the arranging of this assembly. First, we had to move from the original city to Bandung and then our hall in Bandung was canceled three weeks before the assembly. A number of obstacles had to be surmounted in getting the around-the-world travelers from Djakarta to Bandung. One of the greatest difficulties was that, due to inflation, the government raised all fares 400 percent two months before the assembly. Some brothers had to cancel their plans to attend. Nevertheless, every congregation was represented. Due to the generosity of the brothers’ contributions, 111 of the 114 special pioneers were able to attend. This assembly, the largest ever in Indonesia, with a peak attendance of 776, was a source of strength and encouragement to all the brothers from the far-flung islands of Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Earlier, in May, anti-Chinese riots flamed through many cities of West Java. In the town of Tjirebon amid the fearful atmosphere in the aftermath of the riots, and the threatened further riots, our Chinese brothers and special pioneers kept right on preaching. This made a tremendous impression on many who observed their cheerfulness and courage, and much literature was placed with people formerly uninterested, as a result of their observing the brothers sticking to their preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Bandung the Chinese brothers and goodwill people were particularly encouraged by the visits of the servants to their homes while the riots were still in progress. Our Chinese brothers there did not draw back, and in the month of the riots the congregation reached its highest peak ever, with a 60-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new territory was opened during the year. The territory now called Irian Barat and formerly known as Dutch New Guinea passed into Indonesia’s control after a period of United Nations’ administration. Four missionaries were able to enter during the U.N. period and so far they have been able to remain there. They are working in two centers. One of the missionaries reports: “Ten days after our arrival in M---- before</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">beginning door-to-door witnessing, while we were still studj'ing the language every day, the local Protestant minister started personally to visit and warn those that had some connections with us. One answered: ‘You didn’t visit me for five years, and now you suddenly consider it necessary to call on me? I myself shall decide whom I will receive in my home and nobody else!’ Shortly afterward we got an invitation to explain a little more concerning our purpose in a village church. One of the villagers who did not show up later on phoned and warned the same minister about it. From that moment onward troubles really started. First came a personal visit of three local ministers to our house, demanding that we stop preaching in their field. Then weekly warnings started from every pulpit. A letter with some false charges concerning Jehovah’s witnesses was given to each church member. Next, a radio talk against us. Every chieftain of the different tribes was approached in order to have them unlawfully use their influence against us. All elders were instructed to visit every church member. Everyone with whom a home Bible study was held was personally visited by the ministers and intimidated. The results?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The very one that phoned the minister concerning our talk in the church, a former assistant preacher, is now one of the most advanced interested ones. An elder of the church is now arranging our chairs at the Kingdom Hall. Among the fifty people whom we study with we find a former preacher of the Adventist church, also a lady who is a member of the governing body of the Protestant church. Our meetings average now, eight months after our arrival, about twenty people.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,203,300</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 27,541</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society opened a branch office in Israel on January 1 and all the work is now directed from there rather than from Cyprus. The year was outstanding, as much good work was accomplished and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> began to appear in Hebrew by use of a mimeograph machine. We are printing 500 copies of each issue and we look forward to an increase in this during the months ahead. The two congregations in Israel have grown during the year, and the congregation publishers averaged 9.2 hours. They are working now to meet the quota of ten hours a month. It is good to see the interest on the part of some people living in Israel, and here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One outstanding event during the latter part of the year was the national assembly held in Haifa for three and a half days during August. The brothers from all over the country came together to receive spiritual food and to associate with their spiritual brothers. The evening before the last day, the Haifa Chief Rabbi personally intervened and pressured the owners of the hall being rented to cause them to cancel the remaining day of the assembly. Even though the Society had a legal right to the hall by virtue of a written contract with the owners, it was decided not to fight the matter, but to assemble peacefully elsewhere, even though it was extremely hot and uncomfortable. The result of this was over 150 column inches in almost every paper in the country, all of which was favorable, and many of which carried feature articles correctly explaining many Bible truths. This has had considerable influence on many persons who were previously opposed to our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One experience that shows the value of calling back on inactive publishers took place recently after a change in overseers in one of the congregations. The new overseer went to the inactive file and found an entire family of five inactive publishers, four of whom were baptized, and who had ceased association over two years ago as a result of personal difficulties. A study was started with the family in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font7">book, even though they had previously studied this same book twice. Now after six months, two of the younger members of the family are the most regular publishers in the congregation, while the others are continuing to progress. A similar study was just started with two sisters who had been attending meetings some years ago and for similar reasons discontinued associating. They too are progressing well, showing that among the inactive ones are still some of Jehovah’s “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the first time in Israel the Society was invited to lecture on the activity of the New World society. The invitation came from the oldest troop of Boy Scouts in Haifa. The Society’s representative talked to them for about forty minutes, stressing why Jehovah’s witnesses believe in God, then why we believe in the Bible as God’s Word, and finally what we believe. At the end of the short talk the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and Christendom was stressed, showing that only true worship will bring good fruitage. Eighty-five magazines were placed with the group, and questions from the youngsters lasted two hours and twenty minutes. The interest of the group was clearly oriented toward science: why we believe there is a God, and how we prove it. To sum up the attitude of many of the group, one of them stated upon leaving, “Your faith is certainly something extraordinary.” They have extended an invitation to the Society to show the film “The New World Society in Action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;50,708,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,801 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The unforgettable event of the year was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly held in Milan. Never had there been so many Witnesses gathered together in Italy. The branch servant said that all the brothers in Italy expressed their thanks to Jehovah and to Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide who made the Milan assembly possible. The assembly came as a climax to a very blessed service year. During the 1963 service year the greatest witness ever given in the land was accomplished. The branch servant is happy to report that more than 10,000 new subscriptions were taken and more than one million magazines were distributed by the publishers in the field. Here are some experiences from Italy, Libya and Somalia, territory that the branch office in Rome handles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the city of N--- a sister left the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">booklet with a lady and promised to return the following week to answer any questions. On her return visit a young girl came to the door to say that her mother was not at home, but she too accepted a booklet and invited the publisher to call back. The following week still another girl answered the door and accepted </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">booklet. Each time the publisher called she had found a different person, until finally one day she found the first lady again. The householder was very glad to talk with the publisher and to know that she had not given up so easily. After a brief discussion on the booklet a Bible study was started with this lady and one of her daughters. Now they both attend meetings and have agreed to engage in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother was going from house to house in the town of P---. At one home an elderly man came to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">door, and as soon as he heard the message he began to shout that he was tired of meeting Jehovah’s witnesses at the door on Sunday. He exclaimed that he was ashamed of his own townspeople who were doing this work and now there were too many Witnesses in the entire region. The publisher tactfully asked him if he knew why the preaching work was being done, and the man admitted that he did not know. So the brother explained that it was because of love for God and love for neighbor. This made him quiet down and then he began to explain that he was a retired police officer and that he had once arrested four Witnesses for distributing magazines. However, at the trial the Witnesses were freed of all charges. To the publisher the retired law officer now confessed that it had been the local priest who had telephoned police headquarters to have the Witnesses arrested. But now he was willing to accept Bible literature and invited the publisher to return. Further calls developed into a Bible study with this former opposer of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Sardinia a group of Witnesses were working the small town of C---, where the local priests had always</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">stirred up the people against the Kingdom publishers. The circuit servant was training a sister in the house-to-house work when a mob of women and children headed by a nun prevented the Witnesses from continuing in the work. So the circuit servant went to the local station of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">carabinieri,</span><span class="font7"> where he reported the matter to the police officer on duty. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">brigadiers</span><span class="font7"> could hardly believe that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> Catholic nun was interfering with the exercise of religious freedom. He told the brother to continue with his preaching work while he followed at a distance. Soon the nun came out of hiding and, with the mob behind her, began once more to interfere with the witness work. Here the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">brigadiers</span><span class="font7"> came on the scene, and the mob took to its heels, leaving the nun alone to face the police officer. She was strongly reproved and warned to quit her illegal activity against the Witnesses. Then the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">brigadiers</span><span class="font7"> turned to the Kingdom publishers and assured them that they would have no more interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,250,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A brother sold his automobile and in it he had forgotten some personal magazines. The purchaser cleaned out the car and found the magazines, which he read with great interest. So he went to the brother who had sold him the car and asked for other Bible literature to read. The brother gave him a witness and started a Bible study with him. This same brother is also holding a Bible study with an Arabian who became interested due to a discussion on the sanctity of blood. An Arabic Bible was obtained for the man, and now he is studying the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One young publisher twelve years of age was attending a class in science when the professor explained that the first men on earth were uncivilized, had no language and lived in caves. A few days later the same professor was giving a lesson on religion when he explained that God had created man and had placed him in a beautiful paradise. Between classes the young brother asked the professor why one day he had taught that the first man was animal-like and another day that he was perfect. The teacher stated that one was a theory of men and the other a Bible lesson. The young publisher then asked which was the correct one. The professor, finding himself in a dilemma, went away without answering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOMALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,931,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">All Europeans in Mogadiscio especially have had a fairly good opportunity to hear the message and all of them were repeatedly visited by missionaries. Some who were favorably disposed and started to study the truth had to leave the country because of their secular work. The only new people moving into the country are the Communist Chinese and Russians. Due to conditions the people in general are skeptical and indifferent toward spiritual matters. A brother had the opportunity to visit almost everyone who has shown some interest in the past, and although polite and kind and receptive to the message, they seem rather unwilling to study seriously. Every day studies and discussions were had with persons of goodwill, and it is hoped that they will continue to study and increase in knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,638,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica are happy to be contributing to the praise of Jehovah’s name in this ever-expanding New World society. The inhabitants of the island of Jamaica are being well served by the ministers of God, and Jehovah’s people have done far more talking concerning God’s kingdom during the past year than ever before in a year’s time. There have been some increases in <a name="bookmark207"></a><a name="bookmark208"></a>the activity carried on. The branch servant sends in some experiences for the island of Jamaica, Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Combining vacation pioneering with working isolated territory has proved to be fruitful to one congregation. Fourteen brothers out of a congregation of seventy applied to vacation pioneer for two weeks. Besides reporting the regular field service activity for that month, they wrote and told of the success they had in gathering twelve persons in a regular home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of our missionaries tells of an experience he had as a result of engaging in the door-to-door ministry. A young man who teaches school in Jamaica asked many questions that he said were never answered at his church. The Bible answers given sharpened his desire to learn more, so he agreed to having a regular Bible study at his home. Without hesitation this schoolteacher immediately began attending meetings regularly, sharing in the commenting. The new things he learned at the Bible study forcefully impressed on his mind that Jehovah had the Bible written to be understood. Realizing that this understanding was not coming through the churches, he arranged for this system of learning the Bible to be extended to the students of his school. Now the missionary not only conducts the study with him, but has an average of twenty-five schoolchildren attending the study each week, conducted right in the schoolroom. This has had a wholesome effect on the children in their deportment and speaking ability. The teacher? He has advanced another step. He now engages in the field ministry to help find other students of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This same eagerness to learn the truth and share in it is seen in another part of Jamaica where a housewife and her sister asked many questions of one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They were impressed with the information given to them and showed their desire to learn more by attending the congregation book study that same evening. Following the study one lady hurried home to tell the things that she had learned to her husband. Because of not really being able to explain satisfactorily the information heard, she returned to the home of the Witness at 9:30 p.m. and asked if it would be possible to come and speak with her husband. The Witness agreed, and on the way back to the home the woman invited another young man to listen to the discussion. This young man was so much impressed with what he heard that he discussed some of the things with a few of his acquaintances the next day. The following Sunday morning the man and his wife, together with this young man, all appeared at the meeting for service and since that time have attended all congregation meetings and engage in the field ministry regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One man contacted in the 1920’s was impressed with the slogan “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” For years he lost contact with the truth, but in 1956 a study was started with his wife. Fie never joined in the study, but was friendly to the Witnesses. He went away to sea, was taken ill and landed in a hospital in the United States, in need of an operation. While he was there, one of Jehovah’s witnesses met him and urged him to study the Bible. Upon returning home, he eagerly joined in the study with his wife, and was first to begin attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Now he believes he will be among the millions now living who will never die.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One special pioneer is doing very fine work on these islands. He faces opposition from the clergy, but he continues to forge ahead, giving loving assistance to people who want to learn the truth. One person with whom he studies received interference from a clergyman who stirred up opposition through her husband. The husband made it known that he did not want any of Jehovah’s witnesses coming to his home to study with his wife. The woman wanted to learn the truth, however, and so arrangements were made for the study to continue through the mail. The pioneer writes out questions based on an assigned portion of each lesson, and the student writes in the answers, sending them back to be corrected. The delivering of the mail is done by this woman’s sister who works for the post office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant was able to visit the special pioneer in April and to work with him in the field ministry. He reports that the pioneer is putting the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> to good use. Eight persons obtained copies and make it a point to read the text each day and an experience. One lady of goodwill said that she read an experience that was just like her own, that is, having an opposed husband. The experience was a source of strength to her to continue studying.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There are many fine people in Japan, and Jehovah’s witnesses are doing everything possible to help these people to break clear of traditional superstitions. It takes time to make their minds over so that they can conform to the will of the Creator. So with patience Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan keep on preaching and studying with the people, and 1963 was a big year for expanding the witness given to the people of that country. Additionally, Kyoto, Japan, was the location of one of the “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies, which proved to be a real blessing to the people. Here are some reports from the branch servant on Japan and Okinawa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many children among Japan’s ninety-five million population, and, happily, many zealous young ministers among Jehovah’s witnesses. An eight-year-old girl, witnessing in company with her mother, gave the Bible sermon and placed a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book with a junior high school girl and her mother. The young publisher herself made back-calls, giving the back-call sermon and starting a study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font7"> booklet. Although her mother went along with her, the young publisher conducted the study herself. She was immersed at a recent assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister attending middle school was asked to give a three-minute talk in class on any subject of interest. She spoke on “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” One of her classmates later told her that he was very much interested. He subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> and now attends the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, as well as having his regular personal study. Another youthful publisher, following up counsel in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> on ‘letting your light shine,’ used the school lunch hour to explain the truth about evolution to one of his friends. By the time he was through, eight others were also listening. Some denied the existence of God, but four or five attended the next public talk at the service center. Two started attending meetings regularly, and one is making rapid progress toward publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher noted that the “Reader’s Corner” in a big Tokyo newspaper, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yomiuri,</span><span class="font7"> carried items about various social activities. So she wrote the paper a letter about the local congregation meetings. About two weeks later the paper published the information, together with the sister’s address and telephone number. During the next week about twenty people contacted her, nine of them visiting her at her home. She placed fifteen books and two subscriptions with them. To those who came from a distance she supplied addresses of nearby congregations. She herself started to study with four, three men and one woman —people who would not have been contacted in the regular witness work, because of their occupations. One of these, a student, made especially rapid progress, attending Kingdom Hall meetings, engaging in the witness work, and being baptized at the next circuit assembly. The other three are also attending meetings and studying well. All resulting from a brief newspaper announcement!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the year drew to its close, attention was focused on Kyoto, the ancient capital of Buddhist Japan. It was here, in the lovely Kyoto Kaikan, that the Japan assembly of the 1963 around-the-world series was held, August 21-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The assembly made a tremendous impact on Buddhist Kyoto itself. Many new studies have been started. A high school boy attended the assembly as the result of receiving a handbill, and immediately recognized Jehovah’s witnesses as the true Christians. He now studies, together with his mother and grandmother. The latter had attended “church” for forty years, but has recently come to realize that there is a difference between the Bible teaching and what the clergy say. A number of studies have also been started with persons in governmental circles who were impressed by the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the time this report is available to Jehovah’s witnesses around the world, we hope the Tokyo Bethel family will be living and working in the new branch building that Jehovah has so graciously provided for further advancement of the Kingdom work in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OKINAWA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;868,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two years ago the circuit servant’s wife met a person of goodwill, obtained a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscription from her, and commenced a study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font7"> booklet. However, this person had only attended two meetings when she had to move to Yaeyama Island, twenty-two hours away by ship. Although </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> kept coming to her, she lacked association and all but forgot what she had learned. Finally, the subscription renewal notice appeared in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> This little slip of paper really thrilled her, for it told her that the Society was interested in her. From then on she began to appreciate the contents of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> all the more, and especially when she read the article “Right Associations Lead to Life.” But what could she do about association in this isolated island? She received the answer when the circuit servant in Okinawa was invited to Gilead School, and the circuit servant’s wife wrote this woman inviting her to come and stay with her during the year that her husband would be away. She gladly accepted. While this woman looked for work during her first month in Naha, she placed ninety-six magazines in forty-two hours of witnessing and started two home Bible studies of her own. She found a job that allowed her only two free Sundays a month, but when she explained that she had to have every Sunday for theocratic association her employer readily agreed, and he also paid her a higher salary than she had expected. She was baptized at the circuit assembly. Incidentally, the circuit servant’s wife is also using her time well during her husband’s absence, having brought eight new persons to dedication and baptism during the first six months of his being away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,636,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The 1963 service year began for Jordan with the opening of a new branch office to care for the work of that country. It has proved to be the wise thing to do because now the Society has someone there to give full attention to the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, which was especially necessary in connection with assembly matters during the 1963 service year. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences in connection with the work in Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After much effort to obtain permission for the assembly it was finally denied by the government because of the trouble it was feared the other “Christian” religions would cause if Jehovah’s witnesses were allowed to hold a large gathering. It thus became doubtful whether the brothers would even be able to come to Jordan as tourists to see the “Holy Land,” because the Minister of Interior issued a memorandum to all government offices concerned that Jehovah’s witnesses were not to be given visas to enter the country. This arbitrary action was finally overcome by pointing out to various high government officials that, since a large part of Jordan’s income is from tourism, it was most unreasonable to deny entry to over a thousand tourists. And since Jehovah’s witnesses are a recognized Christian community in Jordan, what basis was there to deny them visas to visit the “Holy Land” as tourists like any other Christian group? Jehovah gave us the victory, and happily the way was cleared for the brothers to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And come they did, over a thousand of them. Identified by their lapel badges, their presence and model conduct, together with their incidental witnessing, did a great deal to overcome prejudice and correct wrong ideas that many people in Jerusalem had about Jehovah’s witnesses. One Jerusalem hotel owner well expressed the feelings of many of his fellow citizens when he said to a missionary after the brothers had all gone: “That was the best organized, most orderly group I have ever seen. Can’t you give me some literature to read? I want to know all about Jehovah’s witnesses!” He and others like him are having their desires satisfied in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is always wise to follow the Society’s suggestion to invite people of goodwill with whom we study to attend assemblies. This was done in the case of a young student who was making good progress in knowledge through the home Bible study being held with him but who had not yet started attending meetings and sharing in field service. At the circuit assembly he attended every session and volunteered for duty as an attendant. After hearing the encouragement on the service meeting Friday evening to share in field service during the assembly, he asked a missionary if he could go along in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the assembly he remained in the assembly city for a week to visit relatives living there and took the initiative to make arrangements with an experienced local publisher to accompany him in calling back on the interested people he and the missionary had found in their house-to-house work. When he returned to his hometown toward the end of the month and attended his first congregational meeting there, he approached the congregation servant to turn in his field service report. He told the overseer: “I’m sorry I only made nine and a half hours, so I didn’t quite reach the quota. However, I managed to make the six back-calls and I hope next month to start a Bible study with a school friend.” He now conducts several Bible studies and makes more than twice the quota of hours each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KENYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,676,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">A wide door of opportunity has been opened in Kenya for the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. After a number of years of earnest effort on the part of many brothers it has been possible to open up a branch office and to have missionaries work in the country; so very good progress should be made. At this appropriate time, too, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> book was released in the Swahili language and this in itself should open up a new field. The new branch office in Nairobi takes care of the work in Kenya and Uganda. Here are some experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thirst for Bible knowledge is evidenced in both adults and the new generation alike. One high school for boys was without a teacher to instruct pupils in the Bible. The brothers received a request from some of the pupils for someone to help them. As a result, one of the missionaries is now conducting a regular weekly Bible lesson with 150 pupils at the school between the ages of 13 and 20. Recently the time came for the school holidays, and some of the boys, before their departure to their homes in many parts of Kenya where the truth has not yet been preached, asked how they could take the good news to their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An example that shows the importance of putting the mind of Jehovah into Christian children is shown in the following experience: One day at the school where a young publisher attends the teacher put some religious pictures on the wall. One of these depicted the cross, so the young publisher explained to the teacher that Jesus was not nailed to a cross but to an upright stake. Impressed by the child’s sincerity, the teacher contacted the child’s parent for further Scripture explanation. The parent has continued her discussions with the teacher, who has obtained several of the Society’s publications and now subscribes for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,282,119</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A pioneer placed a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font7"> booklet with the son-in-law of an Anglican clergyman who had become disappointed at the continued failure of the church to answer his questions. A Bible study was started and the following Sunday he was encouraged to attend the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. He enjoyed the meeting and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Though his wife was opposed to his attending the meetings, the young man answered her objections, saying: “I am on my way to find the truth.” After only six months’ study he symbolized his dedication by being baptized at the circuit assembly held in Nairobi, Kenya, traveling over 400 miles to be there. The brother has been a regular publisher since his first report and averages over twenty hours a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Calling back on magazine placements often yields much fruit. A return visit was made on an elderly Sikh gentleman who had taken two copies of the magazines, and he was happy to subscribe for both of them. A short time later a coupon was received from the address of the subscriber. This had been cut from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> requesting the New World Translation of the Bible and the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” A</span><span class="font7"> further call was made and it was found that the son of the subscriber had become so interested in what he had read that he had sent for the additional publications of the Society. After further calls a study was started, with the father attending some of the discussions. The young man has expressed the desire to become one of Jehovah’s people and remarked, “In view of the shortness of the time, I have to do a lot of studying in a hurry.” So seed that is being sown among persons of various faiths in Uganda is bearing fine fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 26,279,627</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The brothers in Korea feel closer than ever to Jehovah’s wonderful organization because of the recent visit by the brothers who made the trip around the world. The branch servant says: “You all got to know us and we got to fellowship with all of you.” The “Everlasting Good News” Assembly probably was as impressive to the people of Seoul as any other convention in any part of the world. It was outstanding, and the witness that was given by our brothers throughout Korea during the 1963 service year was also outstanding. The brothers devoted 1,132,000 hours to the field service, and that is a marvelous witness in itself. The branch servant gives us some interesting highlights of the year’s activity in Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of this assembly on the brothers will be felt for a long time to come, and the effect on the community has been tremendous. One lady wrote to the unit servant of Seoul’s Chunglyangri Unit on August 30, five days after your public lecture: “I read Acts 4:32, which says, ‘Moreover, the multitude of those who had believed had one heart and soul.’ I found this true with Jehovah’s witnesses. I felt sisterly kindness and warmth from the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. I thought I was associating with the saints of God ... I appreciated Mr. N. H. Knorr’s talk very much. He said Jehovah’s witnesses would be willing to teach the Bible regularly. I have read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation but I find it is very difficult to understand. How should I begin to study the Bible?” A study has been started with this lady and with many others because of the interest aroused at the assembly. What a fitting climax to a fine service year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sister from Kwangju’s Pukbu Unit, as the oldest of seven children charged with assisting the mother to care for the family, thought that the pioneer service was impossible for her. She writes she would never have thought it possible had it not been for the circuit servant’s encouraging her and talking the matter over with her mother. With his suggestion she was able to arrange things to pioneer in the daytime and assist the family by tutoring at evening time. She says that at first she thought the schedule to be overwhelming but has learned since that wise scheduling gets things done. Since beginning to pioneer she has been appointed as a study conductor and finds that she has more time for her personal things than she did before she graduated from high school and took up the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the smaller rural communities there is no transportation between the villages. A special pioneer brother assigned to such territory wrote us how he works the farming communities. He and his partner live in the largest village, which contains about three hundred houses. The branch office suggested he try to buy a bicycle to work the other villages, and he did. With no smooth roads to some of them, he has become adept at riding the ridges between the rice paddies. During the farming seasons he can find people only in their fields from sunup to sundown. He makes his back-calls during their lunch periods or late at night after they come in. Some nights he barely makes it home in time for curfew at midnight. In the rainy season he has to carry his bicycle long distances in the darkness. His neighbors have nicknamed him “the owl who preaches at night.” But he has found a way to reach the goodwill people in these villages, and we hope that more of this territory where 65 percent of Korea’s population lives will be covered in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LEBANON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,550,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The brothers in Lebanon for over two years were working hard on the arrangements to take care of the brothers who would come there on the trip around the world during 1963. They had the opportunity to feel the bonds of love existing with their brothers from thirty-nine nations that were represented. Over two hundred brothers were busy working in all the departments that took care of the visiting brothers on their tours and on their arrival and departure from the airport. It was a joy to have the pleasure of visiting the Lebanese brothers in their own Kingdom Halls. Despite much opposition, the good news of the Kingdom is still being preached in all these Arab countries that the branch in Beirut looks after, namely, Lebanon, Bahrain Islands, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Syria. Here are some experiences from these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The extensive legal efforts for over two years to obtain a permit for the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly were from the very beginning directly opposed by the clergy, who pressed the government to deny this permit to us. During this service year for a second time the Cabinet of Ministers refused our application for a permit for an assembly during the visit of our brothers. But this refusal has not been unfruitful, because it has provided us once more a great opportunity to witness to the rulers of this country. The Prime Minister, almost every minister in the Cabinet, the President of the Republic, and almost every deputy of the Parliament in this country were visited in connection with the assembly permit, and what a wonderful opportunity this was to give a witness to them again! As the Minister of Information recently said during </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> visit paid to him in connection with the ban of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font7"> “I know you people visited every deputy in this country about this matter, and many came to me in connection with this matter too,” As a matter of fact, this has irritated the clergy to the point that a prominent Orthodox archbishop wrote to the Prime Minister asking to follow up Jehovah’s witnesses and stop their activities. As a consequence, troubles started with the brothers in two congregations in the territory of this archbishop. Two special pioneers and two congregation servants were arrested and most of the literature in the Kingdom Halls was confiscated, and a case was opened by the Security Department against the brothers in this locality. How happy we were when we saw Jehovah’s protection in giving the victory to his people when the court ruled that there is nothing illegal in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting experience that shows how Jehovah makes arrangements for his “sheep” to be cared for in spite of opposers is one concerning a schoolteacher who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses in the village of K----. His uncle, who is the mayor of the village,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">after much opposition, warned this brother that if he did not stop associating with Jehovah’s witnesses he would ask for his removal from the village, having him transferred elsewhere. Of course, the brother continued his theocratic activities, so his uncle, through the deputy of that district, succeeded in having him transferred. The government arranged for another teacher to replace the brother at the school. The first day of his entering the school, the new teacher was welcomed by the mayor who went to him saying how happy he was to have him in the village, and then he asked him what denomination he belonged to. To his shocked amazement, the answer was, Jehovah’s witnesses! At this the mayor went complaining to the Ministry of Education, saying: “We have tried to get rid of a witness of Jehovah with one star and you have sent us a witness of Jehovah with two stars!!!” He found out that he could do nothing about it at least for one year. Also, the first teacher was sent by the government to a school in an area where the need is great for Jehovah’s witnesses. So, try as they might, opposers cannot stop Jehovah’s work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Our only sister in Bahrain Islands in the Persian Gulf had the joy of receiving the visit of the zone servant at the beginning of the service year and again the visit of the circuit servant at the end of the service year, both of which visits were a source of encouragement to her. She continues to share in the ministry regularly, and she has faithfully sent her report every month to the Society’s office in Beirut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 20,149,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">An interesting experience is related by a German sister who was out in the service with one of her Bible students, a Russian girl. She says: “We met an Armenian lady who was quite friendly and took the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> in Armenian. At the first back-call I arranged to come back for a Bible study. I went alone and started a study in English in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font7">book. The study progressed, and after a few weeks she came to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, which she is now attending regularly. I could see her amazement as we studied the chapter on idol worship, pointing out Exodus 20:4, and was wondering what her reaction would be, since all Armenians cling closely to their church traditions. How great was my joy when I learned months later that a few weeks after she studied this, she quietly took off the cross she had been wearing as a necklace! Then she also confessed that when I had first come to her house she was very suspicious as we introduced ourselves, my little girl friend being Russian and myself being German. She said her first impression was that we were spies using the Bible as a means to get into her house. Very soon she discovered that we were speaking a wonderful message of truth from the Bible. A few months later, as she progressed with two studies a week, she mentioned that she would like her three sons to learn what she now knew to be the truth. Immediately she got three more Armenian </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> books, and now for a month we have been carrying on the study with her teaching the boys as I sit and help her. It is amazing to see the joy that this mother has in teaching her three boys, ages 10, 14, and 16, the truth. One day she said to me, ‘Do you know, I learn a lot while I am teaching them!’ Soon after that she said to me, ‘I am ready to go with you in the service whenever you say.’ Following the wonderful advice in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font7"> I have prepared a good back-call for this new ‘sheep’ and am looking forward to taking her. It is wonderful to experience the great joy we have when our pupils become like the teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAQ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 6,590,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The light of the truth is still flickering in this vast country through one lone publisher, and, although she has no association with Jehovah’s people, she writes: “Dear Brothers in Lebanon, I long to be with Jehovah’s people, but it is truly amazing how Jehovah does strengthen his sheep. As soon as I find myself growing weak, something happens, a magazine arrives, a brother visits, or a wonderful change takes place which could only be attributed to Jehovah ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This sister and her family have moved to a new place where she hopes to make more new contacts in behalf of the truth. She carries on a study with her children and she asks in her letter: “I ask you brothers to pray for me to become stronger, to write to you more often, to be regular with my reports, to study constantly with and teach my children, to help and not be impatient with my husband; in short, to make my home a little Kingdom Hall to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The effect of a letter sent by the Boycott of Israel Office in Damascus, Syria, to all Arab States was felt by the small congregation of Jehovah’s people in Kuwait. At the time of the visit of the circuit servant the authorities confiscated some literature. When the brothers visited the authorities responsible for confiscating the literature, they were informed that the reason for this was that it was being used in preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The investigations of the brothers brought to light that again the same old false charge of Zionism was involved as mentioned in the letter from the Boycott of Israel Office against our work. Since then great difficulties were faced by the brothers in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The congregation servant, a Gilead graduate, was asked to appear before the security officers many times for questioning and finally was arrested on July 25 and kept for over seventeen days without anyone’s being allowed to contact him. After almost two months in prison he was deported from the country without any trial or explanation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A faithful brother from India has carried on with the preaching of the good news for the last few years in Qatar. Many have been the persons that he has been able to speak to about the truth, although no congregation has been organized. The Society’s office has kept in contact with him and encouraged him to continue to put up a hard fight for the faith even if he is completely isolated. Expressing his gratitude, he has written: “I will be failing in my duty if I don’t thank you sincerely for your letters which have enlightened my mind and have given me new zeal in my preaching work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">During the past year of political unrest in Syria, the New World society has not suffered any setback but rather reached the best increase in its history. Two new congregations were organized during the year, as well as various isolated groups, all this under the very difficult situation that the brothers have in carrying on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This does not pass unnoticed by those who oppose the work and, as a consequence, the Boycott of Israel Office in Damascus sent a letter to all the Arab countries misrepresenting Jehovah’s witnesses as Zionists. This resulted in a ban of all the literature in Syria as well as affecting the work to varying degrees in the other Arab countries. However, the Society has presented the full facts to the Political Office in Damascus and also is defending our freedom of worship in three cases in court. One of these cases came about in the village of M---, when a priest led a mob of twenty-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">four hoodlums against the brothers who were on their way to attend a congregation meeting. The mobsters, including the priest, beat up three brothers until one elderly brother was literally dragging on the floor. The local police sided with the brothers and told them to protest against this action in court immediately. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">tEEWAED</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> ISLANDS (Antigua)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in these sun-clad islands have moved forward steadily during the past year, keeping well in mind the advice of the apostle Paul to Timothy: “Fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:5) If anyone is going to accomplish his ministry fully he must seek every opportunity he can to proclaim the good news of God’s kingdom, and the brothers in the Leeward Islands are doing this. The report comes from the branch servant on the islands of Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Eustatius, St. Kitts, St. Maarten and Antigua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This happened in Antigua when a special pioneer was assigned to care for an isolated group. Being anxious to win the confidence of the “other sheep,” he asked if he could attend a village meeting arranged by the head schoolteacher to discuss with parents the subject of “Overcoming Delinquency.” Learning that any respectable person was welcome, the pioneer attended and listened well. When the meeting was about to close, the pioneer asked if he could say something on the matter. Permission was given. Then, pursuing their theme, he tactfully reminded them that if delinquency was to be overcome at home, at school and abroad, nobody could ignore God and his Word, for it alone gives the only solution to the problem of delinquency. He pointed out how delinquency started with responsible persons in Eden by Adam and Eve’s ignoring God’s counsel. Then he went on to state how parents must get acquainted with the Bible and teach their children its contents and live by its righteous principles if they are to overcome delinquency and be blessed by Jehovah. His remarks were received well, and after the meeting some from the audience asked, “Who is that man? He is no ordinary man. We thought him to be some ordinary person, but he speaks good words, the words of the Lord.” Having now gained the confidence of a number of goodwill persons, he was able to establish nine Bible studies within a very short time and obtain a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">subscription from the head schoolteacher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In spite of handicaps, the brothers here are pushing ahead in their ministry, for they have again averaged thirteen hours per publisher, demonstrating that they love Jehovah and their neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the congregation publishers was a delegate to the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York, and on his return he resolved to carry out the best he could the many good things he saw and heard.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">There is a wonderful spirit of love and unity between all ranks of publishers and in many ways they show their determination to press on in serving the Creator. The pioneer spirit too is very evident and ten publishers were vacation pioneers in one congregation during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the congregation was preparing for its “Courageous Ministers” District Assembly, the priests did their utmost to discourage the people from accommodating the more than eighty delegates that were expected at this assembly. They informed them that Jehovah’s witnesses were responsible for lots of killings of priests and nuns in Europe’s communistic countries. However, this wicked lie did not have its intended effect, for the Catholic people did accommodate all the delegates, and the public talk was attended by nearly all who played host to the courageous ministers. The attendance was 170, which meant more than half in attendance were goodwill persons. Victories like this certainly help the brothers to abound in love and right works.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In a territory so influenced by Christendom’s clergy, it is encouraging to see the efforts put forth by the Witnesses to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Their faithfulness has been rewarded with a 7-percent increase in their ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One publisher increased his joy by becoming a vacation pioneer in December, and when sending in his report, he stated, “Having tasted of the joy that comes from serving Jehovah, I would like to extend my vacation pioneering through February.” In March he applied for regular pioneering, was accepted, and the Society invited him to take up the special pioneer work, which he began in August. This increased praise is laying a good foundation for additional praisers in this land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in this small island are very joyful in their work of aiding their neighbors to learn of Jehovah’s kingdom. Contributing to some of the increase has been the erecting of a Kingdom Hall of their own by one of the two congregations located there. As it is situated in the capital, a good witness has been given, with more respect being shown the Kingdom message, for more goodwill persons now regularly attend the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One sister, her two children and a seaman make up the isolated group of publishers who carry on the work here. They are greatly handicapped in having no pioneers to help them. Nevertheless, they have regular visits from the circuit servant and his wife, which keep them spiritually strong. Such visits are eagerly awaited, ana they have learned to make out their reports and send them regularly to the branch office each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They held their first Memorial celebration this year. A sister paid the plane fare for a special pioneer to come from St. Martin, F.W.I., to spend the weekend of Memorial in service with them. All enjoyed spiritual fellowship, with fourteen attending the special public talk and twenty-two at the Memorial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The younger publishers have contributed much to the fine increase by taking to heart the circuit servant’s suggestions on directing the “sheep” to the organization. The result? Three studies were started by two young publishers, and after just four months of study the three interested persons joined them in the service during the next visit of the circuit servant. Incidentally, two others started in the service that same week, and all five are joyfully continuing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The population likes reading the magazines and it is quite a common occurrence for people to come up to the Witnesses and ask for the latest issue. One did this to the visiting district servant, stating that he liked </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> because it had opened his eyes to the many falsities in his religion, so he would like to receive every issue. He was rather worried as to how he could get them as he was living far from town and miles from any of the Witnesses. He was told there would be no difficulty at all if he became a subscriber. He subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> right away and arrangements were made to visit him from time to time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The missionaries are doing their best to assist a newly interested publisher isolated on the distant island of Saba to keep him spiritually strong and active. Visiting him anew after </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> long absence, the missionaries found him keen and keeping the truth alive but not knowing how and when to report his service. This was in June when the missionaries spent thirteen days witnessing over there. They were accompanied by this new publisher and trained him in the different features of service and showed him how and when to report. He reported fourteen hours for June, and since then has regularly reported his activity to the Philipsburg congregation in St. Maarten. His last report said he was having a real tussle with the local priest, who in the end had to “back down.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There are bound to be testings that will come to God’s people in all parts of the earth. A testing came to our brothers in Liberia during the past year. At the beginning of the service year the prospects of increase with more sharing in the preaching work were great. With the passing of months a sudden change took place that affected the number that took their stand for Jehovah God. The whole story appears in detail in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine in the article entitled “Is Liberia Losing Its ‘Love of Liberty’?” There is one thing that is certain, the brothers everywhere, if they are going to stay on Jehovah’s side, must be speaking the Word of God with boldness and they must take a firm stand on his side of the issue. Here is a short report from the acting branch servant in Liberia that gives us good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In January 1963 local newspapers began publishing articles on a recent compulsory flag-salute law that had been passed, which was aimed directly at a “certain religious sect.” Things moved rapidly, and then came arrests and imprisonment of Witnesses. This sparked off a chain reaction of events that was climaxed in the mass arrest of more than 400 brothers in Gbarnga, where the district assembly was being held from March 8 to 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After threats and violent maltreatment at the hands of Liberian soldiers, many of the brothers succumbed to fear and compromised their faith. Of the more than 400 Witnesses arrested only about 75 of the local brothers continued to the last day of detention without compromising, besides a number of foreign brothers and missionaries who had been released earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reports received from brothers and persons of goodwill are interesting. A person of goodwill remarked that the persecution of the Witnesses convinced him that “this is the truth.” He continued, “I hope that by the time of the next persecution I will be with the brothers, taking my stand as a witness of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the aid of Jehovah we have once more started going from house to house, meeting in the Kingdom Hall, and engaging in other features of the service. The brothers in Liberia are grateful to Jehovah for his guidance and protection in this time of trial, and to the many brothers and sisters throughout the world whose letters of protest have contributed to this change in the Government’s attitude toward our preaching activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In this small country of Central Europe the “other sheep” are still being gathered together in goodly numbers, and all of us rejoice with them in the fine work they accomplished during the past year. The branch servant sets out a fine experience in regard to helping those who have ceased their association with the congregation. It shows what can be done, and is very encouraging. We care for not only the new ones, but those who <a name="bookmark209"></a><a name="bookmark210"></a>have dedicated their lives to Jehovah and who for some reason drift away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Heeding counsel brings blessings, as the following experience shows. The Society encouraged servants not to forget those who once associated with the New World society but have ceased to do so for some reason. There was a brother baptized back in 1933. In 1952 he felt justified, because of hurt feelings, to stop associating with the congregation. All efforts to help him failed. Years passed. Many new ones came. He was almost forgotten. Now came the Society’s call to show love to these “lost” ones too. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">congregation servant</span><span class="font7"> took the counsel to heart and visited this “lost” brother. He made only a short friendly visit. He repeated these visits frequently. He also started to talk with his wife, not well disposed to the truth. He even started a study. Finally the brother came to the meetings again, and found people welcoming him heartily. The study at home continued, despite the fact that the brother now came to the meetings. He started field service again and had the joy of attending the assembly in Munich. Now he admits that he was never happy during the ten years he isolated himself, but many times he prayed with tears to Jehovah to find the way back and, with the loving aid of his brothers, following the Society’s counsel, he was helped to come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A couple, refugees from Eastern Europe, lived for some time in Luxembourg before the congregation learned that the woman was a sister. She was contacted, but her husband did not want her to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. Refugee life, void of true friends, drove him into bad association and drinking, creating debts and forcing his wife to earn money too. The more he drank the worse he treated his wife. One day he beat her so terribly that she fled to the congregation servant’s house and stayed there for one week. Later the congregation servant went back with her, trying to reason with the man, using the Bible, saying: “Your wife has here in Luxembourg over 300 brothers and sisters. She will never be alone! But it is much better that she stay with you.” The man was ashamed, and the love shown to his wife impressed him so much that he immediately decided to stop drinking. And he did. With so much goodwill there was only one thing to do: start a study with him. It was not easy to lay a foundation upon which to build a strong faith, but gradually he made progress. He also stopped smoking and, to the joy of his wife and the congregation, he was baptized in Munich. Certainly brotherly love makes a deep impression on all kinds of people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Last year was a busy and successful one for Jehovah’s witnesses in Mauritius. One of the highlights of the year was the visit of Brother Henschel at their circuit assembly. Some of the brothers from this small island were able to get to one of the Around-the-World Assemblies in some part of the earth, and all this activity reflected itself in a 16-percent increase. Here is the report from the acting branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it was announced at our last assembly that all the missionaries would be absent during the month of August to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, one of the local servants who had a holiday from his secular work that month came immediately to the platform and said, “Well, I was going to go to the seaside for my holidays, but under the circumstances I will stay home and pioneer.” He did vacation pioneer along with his wife and six others in the congregation. They had an excellent month of service aiding the other publishers and were greatly blessed for putting Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer reports that a young Catholic man with whom he is now studying had previously ordered a Catholic Bible from France. He was desirous of serving God, so asked the priest if he too could be a minister. The reply was that he did not have enough education. This young man is now full of joy to know, as he has learned from his own Catholic Bible, that he can be a minister, for he attends meetings regularly and now assists in giving sermons from door to door by reading the Bible texts. All who desire to serve Goa can be ministers in spite of their standard of education, as Paul shows at 1 Corinthians 1:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MEXICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 87,233,227</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 30,026 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,240</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brothers in Mexico have had much joy in “preserving alive the soul” by faith during the past service year. One of the unusual things in Mexico is the two traveling Kingdom Ministry Schools that go from one part of the country to another. In different locations the overseers of congregations are brought in along with special pioneers and they are given the training that will help them with their ministry to the people. Already 927 individuals have received the training of the Kingdom Ministry School. The school had its start in July 1961. Another problem the brothers of Mexico have on their hands is the strong opposition of the Catholic church, especially when brothers move into new territories. But let us hear some of the experiences of our brothers as related by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Bible truth begins to be brought to a Catholic town, the priests, not being able to refute true Bible teaching, resort to a campaign of violence to stop Jehovah’s witnesses. An example of this occurred in a town where there were four of Jehovah’s witnesses. During the circuit servant’s visit a mob of about fifty, incited by the priest, ran out the circuit servant and said that if he returned he would be killed. The four local brothers were threatened also, but they remained faithful, with the result that when the circuit servant returned four months later there were eight publishers, a 100-percent increase, and they had a 10.7 hour’ average! Now the authorities are being appealed to for protection, and once again the Catholic church has failed to stop Jehovah’s work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer relates how upon visiting a small town some distance from his congregation and new assignment he discovered that there had been a congregation there years ago but because of problems it was discontinued. Upon visiting this town with the district servant and exhibiting the film to about seventy persons, these spiritually dead brothers began to revive and to associate again with the organization, and now, only a short time later, twenty-five regularly meet for study and seven are publishing. Loving attention could have prevented such a deplorable spiritual condition in this former congregation, but since it did happen it is good to see that loving attention has brought these persons to life again in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers in Mexico still know how to use their feet to walk because very few have cars. When it is meeting time in the congregation those with appreciation know that that is where they should be even if they have to walk. A publisher tells how he walked thirty-two kilometers (nineteen miles) every week to attend meetings when he was learning the truth. But he states that it was not in vain, because Jehovah has now blessed him with the privilege of being a special pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">During the year the congregation in Tangier played host to a Kingdom Ministry School class, and a number of the brothers from Spain were able to attend. These brothers by so doing could study together in complete freedom and also be an inspiration to the congregation in Tangier, a lovely city on the Mediterranean Sea. A fine place was obtained in which to conduct the school, where the Spanish-speaking brothers as well as the Frenchspeaking brothers in Casablanca were trained. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our bilingual national assembly last October in Tangier was more like an international assembly. We had brothers not only from all parts of Morocco present, but also from Gibraltar, Spain, Portugal, and as far away as the Canary Islands. Some of these brothers traveled as many as three days by boat to get to this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Making a back-call on a lady who had subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> the two pioneers found that the son was home. After telling the young man the nature of the call, he exclaimed: “In that case it is not my mother that you need to see but me. She is not the one that reads </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font7"> I am.” Inviting them in, he brought out a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font7"> “This is a wonderful booklet,” he said. “I study it ten minutes on my way to school and ten minutes on my way home.” The pioneers were requested to turn to the pages where he had questions. He asked for the address of the Kingdom Hall and promised to come the next Sunday. On the next call he was disappointed not to have been able to find the hall, but once more had many questions, such as, “Whom does the antichrist refer to?” The next Sunday he was at the meeting and commented. After two or three studies in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> he wanted to go out in the service. He was soon giving the sermon and making his own back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parental persecution became severe, and he was sent to a boarding school in France. However, he was still able to attend the meetings and have a personal Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">For the brothers in the Netherlands the two highlights of the year were the Munich convention, to which ten thousand publishers went, and the breaking of ground for the new four-story Bethel home that will be erected in Amsterdam. All of God’s people are interested in seeing the new system of things and they appreciate that people today must be told about the only hope for the world—God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. On the other hand, the Devil resists the purposes of the Creator and fights the preaching work done by the Creator’s people on earth. But the angels are separating the “sheep” from the “goats.” Here are a few experiences from the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience demonstrates that the message often breaks down opposition. A pioneer sister met the husband in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> family. He was disappointed about all religion. From his youth on he had been educated in a monastery and this had made him opposed to all religion. During the first discussions with him he gave the sister much argument. But once convinced of the truthfulness of the message, he and his wife became very meek. After two months they were baptized and are now regular publishers. Then this man remembered his friend who used to be with him in the same monastery. The wife of the friend was a serious Catholic, She did not like these two men talking about the truth, but she did not know yet that the friend of her husband was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. However, her interest in following their Bible study grew. The brother realized that once she knew he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses she would stop studying because of her aversion toward them, so he thought that it was better not to mention this name yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Armed with his Catholic Bible translation, he treated a subject that he himself had learned the week before. The wife of his friend drank eagerly from the water of life, but still did not know they were having a Bible study with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. From the time she understood whose message it was she was studying, she saw Jehovah’s witnesses as they really are. Gladly she continued the study every week, and now she is already a publisher going from house to house with the good news. Both she and her husband appreciate the truth very much. Together they already have four home Bible studies, and two of these people take part in the preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We need endurance to be friendly and kind in spite of disappointing experiences. A publisher related: “Some years ago we studied with family D---. After one year</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">they stopped the study for some reason. But we continued to visit them, bringing the magazines and telling some points of the truth. One day the chaplain visited this family. The conversation was as follows: ‘Well, here lives the family D----, is it not?’ ‘Yes,’ the man</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">answered, ‘already for three years, and did you now find us?’ The chaplain understood. His reply was: ‘Yes, yes, it is beautiful weather, is it not? Just one minute, let’s see, does not the family Jansen live downstairs? Yes, yes, well, I have to visit those people too. Good-bye, family D---.’ Family D---• was perplexed. Mrs. D---</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">said: ‘Look at our spiritual provider! Consider now Jehovah’s witnesses. Although we discontinued the study with them, they never failed us; they always were friendly and when they came they talked about the Bible and gave us some of the magazines. Well, then, let us ask them again to give us a Bible study, but now seriously.’ Family D----began their study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Para</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">dise</span><span class="font7"> book. Their progress is very good.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The branch office in Curasao in the Netherlands Antilles directs the work on three islands, Aruba, Bonaire and Curasao. There have been some interesting field service experiences on these islands during the past year, some of which definitely show that the Word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword. (Heb. 4:12) It strengthens our faith to see the zeal of the brothers in all parts of the world as they stand up in defense of the truth even before false shepherds. Here are the experiences that were sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The scene of the world is quickly changing and Curacao is no exception. During the past year there have been many changes and many blessings too. Not the least among these changes has been the building of the new Bethel home, branch office and Kingdom Hall all in one, that Brother Knorr made arrangements for when he visited Curasao in March 1962.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though time has brought many changes in Curacao, one thing that does not change with time is the devotion of a Christian to his God and his determination to serve his God even in old age. One elderly brother who is barely able to hobble along with the help of his stick has found a way of exceeding the magazine quota every month. When he was able to go to work he did not fail to witness to his associates and to place magazines with them. Now, although he cannot walk as far as the docks where he once worked, he is able to call at nearby homes of acquaintances who are still in contact with the men with whom he once worked. He not only places magazines with these people, but arranges for them to take magazines from him to his friends on the docks. He never fails to take his order of twenty-four magazines a month from the magazineterritory servant. Helping him in this is a faithful pioneer sister, who is not too busy to visit him with his magazines even though she never reports less than 120 hours a month as a regular pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A priest felt the cutting edge of God’s Word in the presence of a large family of his followers. He had come to visit an aged member of the family but met instead a young member armed with the sword of the spirit in his hand. This young man had only recently become interested in the truth but felt he should use his Bible on this ideal occasion and so began to do so. This was not to the priest’s liking, especially when he found that he could not defend his position against the thrusts from God’s Word. Lunging for the Bible in the young man’s hand that was cutting him to pieces, he grabbed it away and began a futile attempt to break the offensive weapon in two. With a countermove the young man grabbed back his Bible, only to find the priest grasping him by his ear and now trying to push the young man from his chair. Retreating to the door, his only way of escape, the priest fired a parting shot at the young man, still a mere babe in the truth, “You have put me to shame before the whole family.” The young man, recalling Peter’s words, replied in paraphrase, ‘Whoever trusts in Christ will never be put to shame.’ Quite by chance he met this same priest at the home of another person of goodwill. The priest was intimidating the person of goodwill who knew little as yet of God’s Word. The young man quickly took out his sword of the spirit, but before he could use it the priest shouted to him, “Keep your mouth shut.” Hastily the priest withdrew once more. To date the priest has not been seen at either of these two homes again. However, the young man is now preaching God’s Word with confidence and is also considering dedication and water baptism, while the man of goodwill along with all his family is preparing for service and baptism as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The island’s first Witness and congregation servant, who had been lying ill in the hospital, died. Much pressure to take a blood transfusion had been brought upon this aged brother by his Catholic family, but, though old and tired, he kept his integrity till death. There had been much talk about this brother’s stand both in Curacao, where he was in the hospital, and in Bonaire. His sudden death seemed to have stunned even the opposers, and his body was flown by charter plane back to Bonaire. It happened right in the middle of a circuit assembly, and funerals cannot wait in the tropics, not even for circuit assemblies. The funeral discourse was given by the district servant in English to a large crowd gathered at the home, and it was translated by the circuit servant into Papiamento. Then, after the long walk to the graveside, another discourse was presented to a further large crowd. Many more heard the message of the good news that day than would ever have attended the assembly. Following the funeral the publishers took the opportunity to make back-calls on many people and to answer their questions about our position with regard to blood. Quite a number of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blood, Medicine and the Law of God</span><span class="font7"> booklets were placed and a fine witness was given. The simplicity and sincerity of the funeral had impressed even the family, and now the brothers are being received with much more friendliness. One man took a double subscription, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font7"> booklet. Another prominent lady said how disgusted she was with her religious leader who told her that ‘taking blood was not important.’ Still another man expressed his appreciation in a practical manner by freely transporting several of the brothers who had attended the funeral home to Curacao on his boat. The local publishers have certainly learned this year that each one must carry his own load of responsibility as a servant of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have worked urgently to reach the goal of ten hours for congregation publishers in Newfoundland. They did not quite reach the goal, but they are still trying to average that for each month of the year. The brothers in Newfoundland have problems, even as do our brothers in other lands. They are anxious to share in the preaching activity and to be at it urgently in favorable season and in troublesome season. Here are a few interesting experiences from the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience was related by a sister: “Since my dedication to Jehovah nearly six years ago I had never been able to reach my quotas in hours, back-calls and Bible studies regularly. My health had always been poor; so with four children, a husband and a home to care for, it took all my time. However, one of the more mature sisters in our congregation continued without letup in a loving way to encourage me to take part in the service with her. This I did after a long time. I found I really enjoyed it. I started attending the midweek activity and with help started a Bible study with a lady who is anxious to learn the truths of God’s Word. We also do sermon work on that day. A few weeks later I started another Bible study. By this time I was enjoying the service so much I didn’t want to stay home at all while the children were in school. I found it was no trouble at all to meet the quotas, because now I am serving Jehovah from thirty to sixty hours a month and meeting all the other quotas as well and enjoying every minute of it. I can truthfully say my health is far better than it has ever been and I don’t have the headaches I used to have despite the time spent in preparing for service, meetings and student talks. Jehovah has indeed been good to me, and with his help I know I will continue to reach all the quotas from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you hesitate to go from house to house among your immediate neighbors, especially if they have shown opposition? A Bible study conductor tells how he and his service group were blessed by not holding back from witnessing to their neighbors. He says: “Anyone that had ever called on the street where I live was treated rather rudely and, of course, no literature was placed. However, the time came for our group to work the same territory with the current literature offer. Everyone squirmed at the thought. I took the calls nearest my home and the other publishers worked the rest of the street. The first few people contacted were really polite. I was in for greater surprises. A few houses from my own I was invited in and was able to deliver the sermon. The man’s interest was verified when he readily took the Bible-study aid </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font7"> The same thing happened again a few doors farther on when a young couple invited me in. When the street was finished we had placed five bound books with the neighbors we had hesitated to talk to.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The branch office in New Zealand was able to do a little expansion work during the year when some brothers moved out to the Cook Islands and started to witness there. They devoted many hours to the field and a splendid witness was given. In addition to that, of course, there was a grand assembly in Auckland, New Zealand, part of the Around-the-World Assembly, and this served to give a fine witness to the people of that country. Here are some of the branch servant’s comments on the work done in that land during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest witness ever given in New Zealand for the ruling kingdom of God was during the 1963 service year, which ended with the momentous Around-the-World Assembly in Auckland, August 21-25. Never before had so much preaching and teaching been done in one year. Never before had one assembly caused so many people to talk favorably about Jehovah’s witnesses. Unprecedented radio and television newscasts covering all New Zealand played a big part in making it the most widely discussed religious convention in the Dominion’s history and also the largest on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazines continue to help many to come to a knowledge of the truth, but following through is essential if these Kingdom seeds are to grow. A placement of two magazines was followed up by a sister, and the woman accepted the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book. Instead of just leaving it at that, the sister demonstrated how the book could be used to best advantage, and a Bible study was started immediately. The student prepares very thoroughly and when the study is conducted she never looks at the book for answers. When commended for this, she said: “I thought it would be cheating to look at the book.” Later in a short organizational talk after one of the studies, the part that women can have in the theocratic ministry school was explained, along with benefits it provides for the ministry. She was glad to hear of this, because she commented: “I have been thinking about becoming a Witness, and the ministry school is just what I need to help me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are very grateful to Jehovah for the spiritual prosperity throughout the year and the loving and devoted ministry of Brothers Franz and Suiter, who added so much to our first international assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COOK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,378</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A fine start has been made to bring the good news of the Kingdom to the people of the Cook Islands since 1962, when a New Zealand family moved to Rarotonga, the main island of the Cook group. Numbering fifteen in all and covering an area of ninety-three square miles, these islands are owned and administered by the New Zealand government. The island of Rarotonga has 8,676 of the total population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The native Polynesian people read and speak a Maori dialect similar to the New Zealand Maori and they were glad to have the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World </span><span class="font7">in their own Rarotongan language. It was given out when the film ‘‘The Happiness of the New World Society” was screened six times, with a total attendance of 300. As a result many are now asking for home Bible studies. Even before these showings the two New Zealand special pioneers had established sixteen Bible studies. Already three local persons are publishing the “everlasting good news” and conducting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1962 a person of goodwill was prevented from attending the Memorial by his violently opposed Roman Catholic wife, who wrecked his bicycle with an ax, but through the man’s faithful endurance his wife has now accepted the truth. She greatly assisted him in bringing a number of others to the 1963 Memorial, which was attended by twenty-four persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,642,695</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Nicaragua is a very warm Central American country. This is not only true of the climate, but there is also a very warm spiritual climate. The brothers and sisters there have shown affection and consideration, not only for those in the congregation, but for the people scattered throughout the country. They want to help them learn the truth and find the way to life. The branch servant has sent in some experiences that are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher writes how he started a study with a Nazarene who was formerly a Baptist. Soon he accompanied the brother in service, showing remarkable advancement. He was seen in the work by the Baptist minister, who later went to find out why he was preaching. “I was associated with you for years and you never told me of my responsibility to be a minister.” “But you don’t have to be a minister,” cried the Baptist. “Every Christian has to be,” the goodwill person said, and then quoted Joel 2:28,29 and Matthew 28:19,20. Suddenly the minister found he had urgent business elsewhere. Later, the Nazarene minister visited and asked, “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” “No, I’m studying to be. I’m not qualified yet.” “It seems to me that you are qualified,” bemoaned the preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With all the blessings we have received, the new branch building along with a good increase and many field experiences, one of the most precious was to see the tears of appreciation stream down the faces of our brothers here when they returned from the “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies. They were deeply moved at seeing the intensified degree of unity and warm love of their assembled brothers. How vital a part of our lives these assemblies are! One sister related to us that her Bible study person decided to stop her studies. All efforts were futile to reestablish her study, as the pressure was great from her family. Later, one of her sons, who was studying in another home, came to her and invited her to attend the circuit assembly the day of his symbolizing his dedication. The mother felt she could not refuse to be there and so attended. She was so impressed with the warm greetings from the brothers and the love there that she attended the remainder of the assembly. Despite more opposition from her family, she started her study, having it twice weekly, and now participates in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will magazine routes, if well cared for, fade away to nothing during the absence of the publisher who attends an assembly and is gone several months? One missionary writes: “On returning from the New York assembly one of my first interests was to see how my magazine route was. With much joy I found them lamenting the lack of magazines. One man to whom I took three issues said, ‘Three nothing! You owe me ten.’ ” So by placing ourselves first at the doors of the people we can place magazines and keep in touch with them, noting those who are prospective “sheep.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">A fine witness was given during the past year in Nigeria, a land where some men cast certain carved sticks on the ground to read the future. In one instance, on viewing the position of the sticks the man reading them said: “This means trouble.” Others said: “What trouble is this and what sacrifices are needed to appease the trouble?” Just then there was an alert publisher passing nearby and he said: “I can tell you about the trouble. Look, the Bible tells you all about the trouble and here is the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> magazine based on the Bible. If you want to survive the trouble, then survive Armageddon.” The brothers of the land of Nigeria seize every opportunity and preach the good news with success. Here is a report from the branch servant in Lagos on the countries of Nigeria, Dahomey and Fernando Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Ago-Sasa a priest of Sango cursed a pioneer who refused to obey orders to quit the town in seven days. The next day an unseasonal thunderstorm struck the vicinity of the Kingdom Hall while the pioneer was there studying privately. Lightning burned out a breadfruit tree in the Kingdom Hall yard and momentarily paralyzed the pioneer. A few days later a villager explained to the pioneer the cause of his unusual experience: “You must have powerful medicine. When the juju priest left you he got bitter kola and a fowl and made a curse against you before Sango. Sango struck your hall but you lived. And now this very day that juju priest of Sango has been struck dead by lightning in his own home.” Then there was only a congregation book study being held at Ago-Sasa. But the townspeople who were listening to the sermon when the priest threatened the pioneer regarded it as a trial of spirit power. Convinced of Jehovah’s supremacy, many villagers have taken to the truth and now a large congregation is flourishing at Ago-Sasa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An experience at school demonstrates how effective our young ones can be. A loving father bought a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book for his eleven-year-old daughter and taught her from it as a godly parent should. The child took the book to school regularly to read during recreation and other nonstudy periods. Soon her companions would gather around asking questions, which the girl answered. The schoolmates were especially delighted by her enthusiastic explanations of the pictures in the book, which evidently reflected her father’s home instruction. Gradually, the teachers heard of it and sent for the girl and the book. The child gave a wonderful witness in answer to their many questions about paradise. “Bring us four </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> books tomorrow!” In this manner, the eleven-year-old placed four </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> books and six other bound books with her teachers. Praise can come out of the mouth of babes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children can help even their parents into the truth. A boy of thirteen learned the truth when he visited his uncle during holidays. When he returned home he began telling his mother the new things he had learned. Though a prominent woman in the local C.M.S. church, she, nonetheless, got interested in what her son was telling her. She obtained </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,” </span><span class="font7">and a sister started a Bible study with her, which her son supported. That did it. Before long she was attending the congregation book study and all the meetings. Her first day in the service brought her and the son fierce persecution from the husband, who is a committee member of the C.M.S. church. The son was sent away from home, but he joined his uncle and continued studying and preaching. The husband kept up his opposition and persecution of the wife, telling her to drop 'this crazy religion’ and rejoin him in the C.M.S. church. Instead, she remains steadfast for the truth. Both the mother and son have since been immersed in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah, who has founded strength out of the mouth of children.—Ps. 8:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The work in Dahomey moved ahead very well during the past year. There were increases in all features of Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To free people from superstition requires a lot of patience. This is demonstrated in an experience of a circuit servant. He visited a man who had subscribed for the Yoruba </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in the belief that the magazine would help him with spiritistic cures. The man’s room was simply filled with all kinds of “medicine,” as the various juju objects, charms and talismans are called. However, the circuit servant started a Bible study with him. On a subsequent visit to the congregation, the circuit servant visited the man for a Bible study. Noticing that the truth was beginning to take root, the circuit servant kindly explained to the man that Jehovah would never listen to the prayers in the house if the man continued to keep all these “medicines” tied around everywhere. The man said nothing. However, when the circuit servant visited after the next four months, he called at the house and found that the man had got rid of all the juju objects and “medicines”! Not only that, but he attended the circuit assembly, he is now preaching regularly to his family, and one of his sons is a regular publisher preparing for baptism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Fernando Po, although working under difficulties, have put forth good efforts to hold high the Kingdom good news in their various locations. Being under contract and hence unable to move about freely, they, nevertheless, manage to preach many hours in the compounds available to them. And being under Spanish rule where the work is not recognized forces them to work in an unobstrusive manner mainly on back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother, on taking employment in Fernando Po, immediately visited the manager of the estate and politely explained that he was greatly interested in the Bible and liked to preach among the workers. The manager seemed to be very pleased and considered it good that his workers have a minister among them, thus acting as a quieting influence. He gladly gave the brother freedom to preach to the men and told him to report any person who tried to stop him. Since then the brother has been enjoying much freedom for the ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Our brothers in Northern Rhodesia are putting up with a lot of difficulties and harassment by various political parties. These have disturbed quite a number of our brothers. There are still many people in the land who are seeking out Jehovah’s people and who are coming to the point of dedicating their lives to Jehovah and being baptized. However, these new ones do not take the place of many who have left the organization. An accurate knowledge of God’s Word is very essential, and Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world must come to appreciate more and more the need for such. Here are some reports that the branch office in Kitwe sent in on Northern Rhodesia, Tanganyika and Zanzibar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Conduct worthy of the good news in an entire tribal area resulted in a young English married couple’s associating with the New World society. Sent by one of the English universities to make a sociological study of the African way of life, they were immediately impressed by the marked contrast between the way of life of the African Witnesses and the other Africans, nominally Christian and pagan. They noticed, to quote them, “that Jehovah’s witnesses were more progressive, mature, cooperative and law-abiding,” and so they decided that they would have to study the religion of the Witnesses to find out why they were so different. The man is compiling a report to be published in book form and he says that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses will appear throughout the book, not because he is already interested, but because he must put the facts in his report. They admitted that their deep interest was no longer an impersonal one of sociologists but that because of the conduct of the Witnesses they were now personally interested in the truth of the Bible as preached by Jehovah’s witnesses, and they expressed their desire to progress in their study of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the district servant visited a missionary he arranged for him to show the Society’s film to the Asian community. The missionary writes: “After the film a boy of fifteen came to us and asked if he could subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> After the first back-call his Hindu parents objected; so he arranged to come to the missionary home for his study. He came several times </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> week during his school vacation. When he had to return to school in another town I arranged for the brothers there to continue studying with him. The first week he was in school there was a meeting of all Hindus. At the meeting when he was asked to speak, he used the information from the chapter ‘The Spread of Hinduism’ in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font7"> Many began to murmur that this was not Hindu doctrine but Christian; so he said that those who wished to decide for themselves which religion was right could study with him. As a result each week after that, instead of going to the Hindu meeting, nine of the students met with him for Bible study. When he heard of the national assembly at Kitwe, he arranged to spend his school vacation visiting relatives there so that he could attend every session. At present he is home for school vacation, and he has accompanied me in the field service and attends the congregation meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother Henschel’s visit was certainty encouraging and upbuilding, and all the brothers were very happy to have a member of the governing body at their national assembly. This was a truly integrated assembly, and to cater to the four main language groups four separate but adjoining arenas were built in the bush near Kitwe. There was a peak attendance of 24,551, with 631 being baptized at Northern Rhodesia’s first multiracial baptism. Delighted expressions of appreciation for this demonstration of the unity of the New World society were heard from the brothers, worldly persons and political party officials who attended the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At a sugar estate the African workers were threatening to strike because the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">posho</span><span class="font7"> (staple food of maize porridge) was very thin and watery. A European person of goodwill then suggested that one of Jehovah’s witnesses be appointed as cook. After this there were many expressions of satisfaction from the workers about the quality of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">posho.</span><span class="font7"> In fact, the commendation was such that the goodwill person began to be worried that our brother had been using more than the allowed ration of maize flour. However, before he could inquire into this the brother turned Up with a large sack half full of the maize flour, explaining that this was what was left over from the ration allowed to him for making the workers’ porridge. There had never been a surplus before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The highlight of the year was, of course, the visit of Brother Henschel and the national assembly. For this assembly the finest auditorium in all Tanganyika was obtained, the same hall that is used by the legislative assembly when it is in session. During the assembly several government workers had to pass through the building, and their attention was attracted by the sight of African, Coloured and European brothers working in close harmony. They made appreciative comments about this evidence of the unity existing among Jehovah’s witnesses and some listened to part of the sessions. Among those who came along to hear Brother Henschel was the mayor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The American family stationed on this “Island of Cloves” have continued to work steadily throughout the year and it now looks as if some fruitage may be produced from among the predominantly Moslem population here. The showing of the film “The Happiness of the New World Society” aroused some good interest. A few promising Bible studies were started, including some with Asian and African Moslems. One of these, an Indian Moslem, speaks of himself as a witness of Jehovah and is witnessing boldly among his friends, explaining that Jehovah is the only supreme God. Three of the Bible students have indicated that they are considering sharing in the house-to-house ministry, and it is hoped that in the first month of this service year at least one of them will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the brother’s contract is ending, this family will have to leave the island in a few months, but they hope that some of those who have expressed a desire to serve on this scenic island will arrive before then so that the goodwill persons may have continuous assistance and encouragement. According to the brother, as long as one does not engage in secular work there would be no difficulty to remain there on a visitor’s pass telling others the “everlasting good news.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">It has been very observable that as materialism increases and prosperity grows, and they get a strong grip on the people, some brothers get ensnared. Those, however, who keep putting Kingdom interests first in their lives are richly blessed. All this great prosperity around them does not attract them away from doing the will of God. It is something that must be watched by every individual. Norway is beginning to feel the pull toward materialistic pursuits. The branch sends in some interesting experiences on what is happening in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it possible for a whole family to be vacation pioneers at the same time? Yes! It was done by a family who served as vacation pioneers on their way home from the international convention in Stockholm. They were father, mother and four children, eighteen, fifteen and thirteen years of age and one one year of age. Five of the family used from two to six hours each day in the service, and they took care of the youngest, each one in his turn. “This proved to be the most ideal vacation for us,” the father writes to the Society, “and we strongly recommend to other families to use their vacation in the vacation pioneer service. We have never had such a joyful vacation before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience shows how necessary it is for a woman to endure in faith despite opposition from her husband and that this even may lead to an opening of the husband’s eyes. A special pioneer sister writes: “After having studied a couple of times with a woman in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> she soon found out that this was the truth and before long attended the meetings regularly. However, her husband disliked this and tried to make her stop studying, but in vain. She encouraged him in a friendly way to read some of the Society’s literature, but he did not even want to touch a magazine. But he noticed one thing—his wife continued to study with the same zeal. One evening he felt that he had to look into this book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font7"> and he soon realized that what he read was quite different from what he had believed. He not only read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font7"> but he asked for all the latest books of the Society. He began to attend the congregational meetings, and he and his wife were both present at a circuit assembly that was held in the town where they lived. He asked me to have the study in his home at a time when he could be present too, because, he said, he wanted to make progress in the truth together with his wife. They both soon understood how important it is to tell the truth to others, and in April she started in the service. He enrolled in the ministry school and started in the service in June, and they both went with me to the international convention in Stockholm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NYASALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,983,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15,061 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 198</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Nyasaland in certain areas have had opportunity to prove the depth of their devotion and their love for Jehovah God during the past service year. Many of them have had to go through some very unpleasant experiences, but they have kept the apostle Paul’s words in mind as found in Romans 8:35, 37: “Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?” Many have had to face real tests of integrity, and so will all of Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide, but they prove themselves worthy of Christ’s love despite hardships. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch in Blantyre covering Nyasaland and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many times faithfulness under persecution brings increase and makes honest-minded people think. In one area up north </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> Kingdom Hall was burned down and both brothers and sisters were mistreated. When the people saw the unity among the brothers and in what a wonderful noncomplaining spirit the brothers took everything, many came to the congregation servant, in fact, about thirty of them, and said words to this effect: “Now we know that your church is the true church, because no one else would be able to take all these bad things that have happened to you as you do. You are true Christians and therefore we want to become members of your church.” The congregation servant told them what they would have to do and that Jehovah’s witnesses would be happy to study the Bible with them. Many Bible studies have now been started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Age is no hindrance to accepting the truth. When a district servant went with a publisher to a home Bible study he learned that the student was 101 years of age. But you should have heard that man answer the review questions after the study! We invited him to come to the public talk the following day. “But,” said the district servant, “it is three miles to the meeting place. Perhaps we should try to arrange some transport.” “No need for that,” said the old man. “I need some exercise, and three miles is nothing to me.” Did he come to the meeting? Yes, and he was usually the first to applaud when some fine Scriptural points were brought out. When the talk was over he expressed his appreciation for what had been said and added that he had been preaching to some eight men before coming to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certainly this has been an eventful year in the lives of Jehovah’s witnesses in Nyasaland. Brother Henschel visited the country and gave some excellent points of counsel. To this very day the brothers are reviewing points he brought out. The national assembly was successful because Jehovah blessed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The letter from Brother Knorr informing us that, because of the generosity of the brothers worldwide, eleven full-time servants would be able to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in London made us glad. Then, too, we received permission from Brother Knorr to start mimeographing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Tumbuka. The first two issues have now been sent out and the Tumbuka-speaking brothers in the troubled Northern Province are overwhelmed with thankfulness to the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present,” Jehovah our heavenly Father.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What a thrill for the brothers in Lourengo Marques, the capital of Mozambique, to have Brother Henschel in their midst for three days! Certainly the effect on the Kingdom work of what Brother Henschel did during those days can already clearly be seen. The brothers in Mozambique have every reason to say with the psalmist: &quot;Taste and see that Jehovah is good.” (Ps. 34:8) In most parts of the country they have been able to carry on their preaching work peacefully and Jehovah has blessed them with an excellent increase in the number of praisers of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never miss the opportunity to start a home Bible study. A back-call was made on a man who had written to the branch office in Nyasaland asking for some publications. The man had moved out of town, but a study was started with his sister-in-law instead, who, as a result of the study, left her church and began to attend the meetings. When the circuit servant visited the group, she went from house to house with the circuit servant’s wife and expressed great joy, saying, “I thought I would be too nervous to say anything, but the words seemed to come out so easily.” She spoke so naturally and sincerely that the people listened intently to her words. Now a friend to whom she has witnessed has stopped going to mass, which she previously attended regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PAKISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 93,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The brothers were delighted during the year with the fine progress made in gathering together the “other sheep.” The finest witness ever given in the country was effected this year, with the brothers and sisters spending 44,714 hours witnessing. They are also doing well with their Bible studies, reaching a new peak in that field. Here is what the branch office in Lahore reports concerning the work in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Pakistan were indeed happy to be able to assemble with our brothers from many lands in New Delhi. Over forty persons were able to get to the convention. It will be a long time before we stop talking about that assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A congregation servant writes in this experience showing the value of public lectures: “A public lecture on the subject ‘Maintaining a Happy Family Circle’ was arranged to be given at a congregation book study center. A family in which the wife was Roman Catholic and the husband was Pentecostal were invited to attend. They came and listened attentively to the talk. After the talk the family was invited to have a weekly Bible study. This was gladly accepted. The husband and wife, after the first study, stopped attending their respective church services. Not only this change came, but the wife gladly told that after hearing the public lecture, the husband, who previously used to beat her on even petty matters changed, and love and happiness now prevail in the family. This happy family progressed well in the truth. They have now regularly published the good news for the last six months and are keenly looking forward to the next assembly, when they plan to be baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes it is the goodwill people who come looking for the brothers. A missionary writes the following experience: “A man of the Muslim religion approached me as I was working from house to house near his home and inquired about our work. He eagerly accepted the two magazines I offered him, and arrangements were made for me to call at his home two days later. He was waiting for me that day and we immediately started to study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Loolc!’</span><span class="font7"> booklet. He made quick progress. From the beginning he attended the congregation meetings and shared in them with his own comments. He had previously been to a number of ‘Christian’ religions to try to And someone to teach him the Bible, but no one seemed to want to bother, not even his neighbors who professed Christianity, that is, until after I started to study with him. Those who previously would not help him now came with their offers to teach him, suggesting that he was not getting the truth of Christianity from us. It was all to no avail. He continued to study, attend meetings, witness to his friends, even placing a New World Translation Bible with one of his superior officers at work. When I felt the time was right, he was invited to share with me in the house-to-house work. He was keen to go and shared in giving a witness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In East Pakistan there are 50,000,000 people and we have only one elderly sister to care for them. Is there anyone who can come to Pakistan and serve where the need is great?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AFGHANISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: 1 to 1,333,333</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Afghanistan were very happy to attend the recent Around-the-World “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New Delhi. It certainly was the highlight of the year. The local overseer of this small faithful group writes: “The assembly was certainly wonderful in all ways. I haven’t enjoyed myself so much since the Kingdom Ministry School.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another highlight of the year for the brothers in Afghanistan was the first visit of the circuit servant. The brothers were spiritually strengthened and were happy to have a busy week of service with the visiting servant. It is hoped that regular visits of the circuit servant can now be made to this small group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the month of August the brothers found that their magazines had accumulated. Taking to heart the wise counsel given at the assembly, they placed them wherever they went. When they had totaled up the report for the month, they had an average of 41.7 per congregation publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;1,177,419</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,470 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 801</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some things are hard to understand. Panama is a country having an increase in hours, distribution of magazines, Bible studies and back-calls. Why is it, then, that there was no overall increase in the number of publishers? In Panama during the year a number of unworthy ones were expelled from the congregation so that the whole organization might be kept clean. Others left the organization of their own accord because of lack of interest. It appears that with more congregations this year there will be more publishers next year. If it is Jehovah’s will for a greater increase to be effected in Panama, it will be so. Here are some of the experiences sent in by the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The deaf are hearing,” said Jesus, in the message he sent back to the inquiring John the Baptist. A similar report comes from a missionary in the interior of Panama. Says she, “I started a study with a stone-deaf man who could, however, read and speak. So, in the study, he would read the question and then give the answer. If it was not correct I would write the correct answer for him. He soon became a regular publisher and was baptized. His mother and sister were Catholics and would not listen. Then the sister moved away and began to study the Bible and to feel the need for help. She sent to me for literature, and I would send her each issue of the magazines. Then she moved back home to be able to study with me. Now she is baptized, and the mother hopes to be at the next assembly. Then all the family will be in the truth. But the deaf heard first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Calling on “not-at-homes” produces surprising results sometimes. A missionary sister reports: “Calling on a home where no one was found previously I found a woman lazily sunning herself, lying on the grass. I spoke to her for about thirty minutes about the kingdom of God, but she showed little interest. But she did admit that what I had said was from the Bible. Could that mean a spark of interest? A booklet was left, so </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">return call should tell the story. It did. And what a happy story! She had read the booklet. It made sense. And now the householder supposed she would be changing her religion. I was sent to another assignment, but this interest was cared for by another publisher. In just six months from the initial call she symbolized her dedication by water baptism. Her husband, a military man, is deeply interested.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PAPUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;487,050</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 398 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,224</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The message of Jehovah’s kingdom continues to spread out to the uttermost parts of the territory of Papua, even penetrating back to areas where there are demonized, heathen people. Many of these people are now being molded by the principles of God’s Word and are becoming mature publishers of the Kingdom. It takes many months and a lot of patience on the part of the mature ones to help these illiterate people turn from the worship of demons to the worship of the true God. There are many very interesting experiences sent in by the branch office located at Port Moresby concerning the work done in Papua, New Britain, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In most congregations the brothers are becoming more discreet in starting new publishers in the field service. A thorough check is made of each new prospective publisher and the requirements are fully explained to him. The result has been that many have not been allowed to report due to the fact, as an example, that the bride price has not been fully paid. When these matters are explained to them many begin to right matters for themselves. This was illustrated in a congregation where the circuit servant was asked about a certain person of goodwill. He had not paid the bride price, though he had been married about eighteen months. It was pointed out that, to conform to the Society’s policy, he must pay the full bride price before he could be counted as a publisher. When this information was translated to the man, he agreed, saying that he was not really happy, either, with the way he was living. During the few weeks following he was very busy making arrangements to obtain the full bride price. Now it is paid and a happy new publisher has been added to the list!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friendliness to strangers often pays dividends. Writes a circuit servant: “On Monday morning my wife and I together with three native brothers set out to paddle up the river to visit an isolated group. This trip takes eight hours. Just about midday another canoe carrying a European man and some Papuans passed us, going down the river. We both nodded to them and after they had passed I inquired from the native brothers as to who the European was. They replied that he was the manager of one of the local rubber and copra plantations. As we were learning these facts we noticed that his canoe was turning around and coming back toward us. Greeting us, this manager commented that usually he acknowledged people when he passed them on the river but that never before had anyone nodded back to him. When we had done so he was impressed and asked his Papuan boys who we were. On finding out he immediately decided to turn back and speak to us. He was very friendly and invited us to his home for the night, and we were happy to accept this hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A very pleasant time was had with him and his wife. He related to us an experience he had during the ‘eclipse episode’ when the missions were blaming Jehovah’s witnesses for telling that such occurrence would be a sign that the end of the world had come! The native boys were much frightened by such stories and were leaving the plantations and returning home. The plantation managers were blaming Jehovah’s witnesses for these stories. On this occasion our newly found friend had spoken up in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses and said that even if individuals spread such stories the organization as a whole was not to be condemned, as he knew we were different. When the time came for our return trip this plantation manager offered us the use of his canoe with its outboard motor and sent a crew of five boys to take it down for us, at the same time towing our paddle canoe behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This plantation manager asked us to visit him again and bring with us the Society’s film so that it could be shown to all the natives on the plantation. Now the native congregation servant can visit his plantation and conduct studies there any time he is in that area.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the big events of this year for us has been the Melbourne “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, which eighty-five witnesses from these islands were able to attend. Eighteen of these were native brothers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW BRITAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102,192</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 61 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,675</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up until this last year the work was confined mostly to the town of Rabaul. Earlier in the year two brothers went to work in a timber camp on the north coast of New Britain Island. Now they have written in to the congregation requesting literature and urgently requesting that a pioneer be sent down to help them. The one brother reports that he has over a hundred interested persons with whom he regularly conducts studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another center on this same island a native brother now regularly requests literature to satisfy the needs of a whole village. After a public discussion between the brother and the local clergyman the villagers told the priest to leave them as they now want Jehovah’s witnesses to teach them and therefore have no further need of him!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience serves to show how important it is to read and act on all advice given through the pages of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and also to realize that even though we are fortified with the truth and belong to Jehovah’s organization, we can still lay ourselves open to attacks by wicked spirit forces. Four years ago, a professional fortune-teller in the West Indies gave her departing daughter a gold bracelet from which were suspended tiny replicas of horseshoes, wishbones, and so forth. Recently, the daughter, who for the last three years has been a faithful baptized witness of Jehovah, lovingly gave the bracelet to a young sister of high school age. About two weeks later the younger sister became afflicted for two days with severe knifelike pains in the stomach. When the first sister inquired as to the nature of the pains, she said: “Do you know, they are the same kind of pains that I have suffered for over four years, often with tears, and which the doctors could not cure. But now that you mention it, I realize that ever since I gave you that bracelet I have not had the pains at all. Just the other day, however, the circuit servant’s wife suggested that in view of what the article ‘Resisting Wicked Spirit Forces’ in the March 15, 1963, issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> had to say we should think of that bracelet in the event of any strange things happening in your house. You see, my mother used to experience bed-shaking, which indicates demon activity. But it had never occurred to me that there may have been a connection between that bracelet and my pains, which now seem to have been transferred to you. You must get rid of that bracelet as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> advised us to do.” The bracelet was then carefully concealed inside an empty fish can and deposited in the rubbish dump. Neither sister has experienced the pains since then!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,224,003</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One brother and his wife have just returned home, and he tells the following experience that illustrates how interest can be aroused and prejudice overcome by a tactful approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“On arrival in my village I immediately began calling on the homes of my friends and relatives, to share with them all the good things my wife and I had learned. In this Catholic community many showed interest and asked questions. Soon the whole village was talking about this new religion, much to the dismay of the native Catholic teacher. He then began going from house to house warning the people not to have anything to do with this new religion and saying all kinds of evil things about me. On hearing these accusations, I decided to confront the teacher; so I waited close to the path when I saw him coming along. As he approached I stepped out in front of him holding out my hand in greeting. At the sight of me he began to tremble, and when I confronted him with the accusations he had made, he at first denied them. As his anger increased he admitted that he had warned the people against me and told them not to accept this ‘new mission.’ I remained very calm and, after opening my Bible, I began explaining the work of Jehovah’s witnesses to him. As I progressed in my explanation his anger subsided and soon he was asking questions and showing interest. Then he said he was very sorry for all the nasty things he had said about me and asked if we could have further discussions. We met regularly during my month’s vacation in the village. Now we are continuing our study by correspondence. I am hoping he will cast off the shackles of false religion and become a real teacher of Jehovah’s truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brother and sister who left their comfortable quarters in Port Moresby to settle in the western highlands of New Guinea write: “Every effort was made to stop us from obtaining land for our trade store and home. The local priest roused these primitive people to go to the government district officer and ask him to send us back to Australia, as they did not want us there. This just officer said ‘No.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“As time went by, these primitive people found out we were very kind to them. This was something foreign to them. Often tears would come to their eyes when we showed kindness. The result was that one day the owners of the land gathered to say that they had changed their minds and now wanted us to stay. However, the interpreter of the priest came to try to excite to opposition. We took the ‘bull by the horns’ and took this mobster right up to the priest’s house, with many of the native folk following us. Here we informed the priest we would not stand for his bigotry and intolerance any longer and that he was not acting in a Christlike manner. Then we left the priest and went straight to the district officer with about fifty native folk following us. We told him what had occurred at the priest’s house and gave him a copy of the U.N. Charter to read, showing him that there should be freedom of religion, especially in a United Nations protectorate.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The service year in the Solomon Islands ended on an enthusiastic and exciting note. Due to the contributions made by the brothers in other lands all the native special pioneers, six in number, were able to attend the Melbourne “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. What changes for them! They had to learn so many things: to wear shoes, long trousers and coats, sleep in real beds, have several blankets at night to keep warm, even use a hot-water bottle to get their feet warm! They saw their first trains and then spent several days on them to reach the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often these native pioneers had been asked by the villagers: “What does the government of Australia think about Jehovah’s witnesses? Are there many Witnesses in that country?” Now they can truly answer these questions. They were thrilled to see over 12,000 Witnesses gathered in Melbourne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truthfulness of Jesus’ words, “The harvest is great,” is being experienced by the publishers working on the island of Malaita. The two native special pioneers who were sent to aid the many goodwill people there are now studying with over 500 people by means of picture sermons on blackboards, which helps to hurdle the barrier of illiteracy. Now many hundreds more are requesting brothers to come and teach them, and the original twenty-eight villages requesting help have increased to many more. One of their former mission pastors has made his dedication and been baptized and is now carrying on a fine work and is conducting Bible studies with over forty people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The past year has been one of spiritual prosperity for Jehovah’s witnesses in Paraguay, and they are reaping the fruits of their labors. Paul said: “So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.” (Gal. 6:9) Good reaping was done this year in that the brothers in Paraguay enjoyed a 9-percent increase in publishers. Here are some experiences reported by the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">December 22, 1962, saw the dedication of the first Kingdom Hall to be built and owned by the brothers in the country. It is a fine brick and cement structure that can seat over 200. The time of the dedication tied in nicely with the visit of the zone servant, so 173 persons received a double treat, hearing the Society’s traveling representative deliver the dedication discourse and other animating information. Many were the expressions of happiness, joy and gratitude that were heard during the period of fellowshiping that followed. The construction of the hall itself provided a fine witness as men, women and children took part in digging, mixing cement, polishing bricks and later painting and cleaning up. Seeing all this activity over an extended period of time, the city electrical inspector said: “I can see that you truly have an organization of workers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Time that is spent studying with people and teaching them what the Bible has to say can never be looked upon as wasted, even if the results do not manifest themselves right away. A missionary brother on coming to Paraguay nine years ago began his very first study with a man who had three young children. The study progressed for some time but the man did not seem to want to accept responsibility, so the study was stopped, with the man continuing as a subscriber and attending an occasional public meeting. Through his study he recognized that Jehovah’s witnesses had the truth and so he never bothered sending any of his children to the local Catholic church. But as time passed and the children grew older, the neighbors began to ask them why they did not attend church and began to apply pressure to get them to do so. Seeing that his children could not give satisfactory answers to the neighbors’ questions, the man made arrangements to have the brother study with them. On his arrival for the first study the brother was surprised to see three young people waiting and all ready for the study with their Bibles open. They were now youths of sixteen to twenty years of age. From the time of the first study they have never missed a meeting, and after three months of study all were out in the service and having part in the theocratic ministry school. The oldest was baptized after five months of study and began vacation pioneer service immediately on completing six months as a regular publisher, and his goal now is the regular and special pioneer service. His younger brother and sister, too, are making fine progress. The father? He is happy and proud that his children can now give an answer to those who ask about their hope. The missionary brother? He is happy that nine years ago he planted the seed that is now bearing fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,014,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,824 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,587</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fourth class of the Kingdom Ministry School was held in Peru this year, and the branch servant feels certain that the good progress during the year has been made possible by the excellent training and counsel that this school has provided for the overseers. Jehovah’s witnesses have worked hard in Peru, both overseers and publishers together, and the harvest was good. They enjoyed a 15-percent increase and we are very grateful that twenty-seven brothers and sisters could be helped to attend the assembly during the past summer. A total of eighty-four delegates represented Peru at three assemblies held in the United States. They had many good experiences in the field service, and the branch sends in the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When necessity causes one to leave a new Bible study for a time, he wonders whether the interest will wane during his absence. Prior to leaving for the New York assembly a missionary started a study with a butcher and his family who, in the three or four studies held before his departure, showed remarkable progress. On returning to his assignment he was anxious to learn how this family had fared. He was happy to find they had continued their studies and meeting attendance, and that the wife had removed all her Catholic images from the walls of her home. Gifted with an inquiring mind, the butcher had decided to visit other nonCatholic organizations to compare their teachings with the truth. First he visited the Pentecostal church, where he was invited to attend services in a public park and was told later that he would have their teachings explained to him some other time. The services were devoid of truth. Meanwhile a group of Salvation Army people arrived to compete with the Pentecostals, and in the resultant confusion the butcher was abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He decided to visit the Mormons. He asked for information on their doctrines and was told to listen to the talk that was being delivered in the Mormon church. After the talk he renewed his request but was told that it was time for the recreation period. Disgusted at the childish games played right in the church, he was convinced that the only organization interested in teaching the people the truth is that of Jehovah’s witnesses. He has stopped wasting his time seeking knowledge in other organizations and is now concentrating on increasing his knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fearing Jehovah rather than men helped a young pioneer brother working from door to door who unexpectedly came upon the home of a Catholic priest. He was invited to enter and be seated. It was the first time the brother had ever met a priest face to face in offering the message and a touch of panic made him wish he had dismissed himself without entering. Could he ably present his sermon to this man of academic and theological background? With a silent prayer he boldly began, “I am a bearer of God’s Word and I have an important message for you concerning peace.” The priest listened condescendingly. During the sermon he stopped and asked the priest, “When will true peace come?” “That is something no one knows, my son,” he replied. The young brother responded, “God has provided his Word by means of which mankind can learn about his purposes, and since you do not know, I, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, shall tell you when true peace will come. Do you know the meaning of the ‘Our Father’?” The priest blushed, still at a loss for words. “Then I shall teach you the meaning of it,” our brother continued. The clergyman listened intently with admiration in his eyes as this youngster demonstrated an excellent command of the Holy Scriptures. The priest, with an equal lack of response to other questions, finally took two booklets and congratulated the brother for his good preparation and expressed his appreciation for an organization that could train young people boldly to defend their faith as this young brother had done. Truly, “he that is trusting Jehovah will be protected.”—Prov. 29:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC Population: 27,473,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses greatly rejoice in that 2,342 newly baptized brothers and sisters joined their ranks to preach the good news of the Kingdom in the Philippine Islands. The outstanding event of the past year was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. This was not only the largest convention to date for the Philippines, but also by far the happiest and most successful. The branch servant has sent in some interesting experiences, which are published herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event of the service year was our grand privilege of being one of the hosts of the Around-the-World Assembly. Many hundreds of brothers worked long and hard in preparation for this foremost event, and the preassembly organization ran smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day before the assembly was to begin on August 14, however, a storm warning was broadcast. Typhoon “Luding” was on her way. She arrived in all her fury on the opening day and played havoc with the platform and the temporary roofing that had been built over the bleacher section, even flooding many departments in the stadium. The first session for field service had to be canceled. However, late in the morning the winds began to subside, and immediately many willing hands set to work to repair the damage. The assembly program got under way with the afternoon session and continued to a successful conclusion on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with the public meeting attendance of 37,806 far exceeding our most optimistic hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the year ended on such a joyful note, anxious weeks were spent by the brothers here early in the year when the Philippine government threatened to deport all foreign missionaries. The branch servant was given twenty days to submit a written memorandum showing why the missionaries should not be deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outcome of this was a letter from the Deportation Board to the branch office on December 10, 1962, which said: “Please be advised that the case against you and other members of your ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’ for alleged refusal to salute our flag has been dropped.” In recommending the case to be dropped, the Secretary of Justice was quoted in the Manila </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> of December 6, 1962, as saying: “It does not necessarily follow that citizens who refuse to salute the flag for being contrary to their religious beliefs are less patriotic and less law-abiding than those who do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus said: “No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields.” (Mark 10:29, 30) The truth of these words can be seen in the following experience. An elderly couple who were studying with a special pioneer were being strongly opposed by their children and friends. The husband became ill and his children and neighbors blamed the illness on his change of religion. The dying man’s son insisted on getting a priest to have the last rites administered in order that he would die peacefully. But the dying man’s wife boldly defended the truth and explained what the Bible has to say about death. When the man died, none of the children or neighbors came to help. The wife informed the special pioneer, and soon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> busload of brothers and sisters from a nearby congregation came bringing a coffin and flowers, and they made all the arrangements for the funeral. The brothers could not hire transportation to the cemetery due to opposition and so they carried the coffin seven kilometers (4.3 miles) in the rain. What was the result? The special pioneer sister writes: “The whole community was softened by the Christian cooperation that the brothers showed. The bereaved wife and two of her daughters and a grandson are now immersed, while the sons who were so bitterly opposed are now studying. All this because of the Christian conduct and loving help of Jehovah’s people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,470,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,798 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,267</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What could be the result of increased persecution by the Portuguese government against Jehovah’s witnesses? The banning of the literature published by the Society was followed by a wave of arrests and intimidation by the police. Did this stop the brothers in their determination to serve Jehovah God? The answer is that there was a 29-percent increase in the number of publishers. They have kept on preaching the Word. Their attitude is the same as David’s: “In God I have put my trust. I shall not be afraid. What can earthling man do to me?”—Ps. 56:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was no possibility of holding an assembly in Portugal during the past year, but a goodly number of the brothers were able to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Milan. This came as a great refreshment to the brothers, and they brought back plenty of good news to their fellow workers in Portugal. Here are reports on Portugal, Angola, Azores, Cape Verde Islands, Madeira and Sao Tome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There have been not only many articles in the newspapers concerning us but also a series of discussions on a television program called “Tomorrow Is Sunday” by a Roman Catholic priest. With the help of Protestant literature against us, he hoped to destroy the doctrine of “this sect that is becoming so popular in Portugal and the rest of the world.” His knowledge of the Bible proved so negligible that his arguments fell flat, and each week it became more evident that Jehovah’s witnesses were truly a different and distinct people who really practice their religion. As the series continued different persons wrote in, and the priest was so amazed at the response that he decided to run another series of talks on the same subject. One letter was from the president of the Evangelical Methodist Church of Portugal in which, although commending the priest for what he was doing to stop Jehovah’s witnesses, he had to admit concerning them that “the devotion and perseverance they have in spreading their ideas by all means” must be noted. The letter continued, “I have seen them all over Europe, on good days and bad days, selling their literature, and many times in the streets of the big cities the presence of them is the only visible manifestation of religious activity. How good it would be if everyone who accepts Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior would manifest the same consecration and activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not content with trying to destroy our doctrines, this priest began to call Jehovah’s witnesses seditious. His hope was to discourage people from talking with Jehovah’s witnesses, but what was the result? The brothers immediately noted a more interested attitude by many of the people they met in the door-to-door work, and many curious people who had never taken notice of us before have invited us into their homes. The following is one such experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters were going from door to door and were firmly told by a woman at one door that she was not interested. Just as the door was about to close, her husband interrupted and invited the sisters to come in. “Are you Jehovah’s witnesses?” he asked. “I have heard all about you on television and have some questions to ask.” He began by saying that the priest on television had called us wolves who were stealing the sheep, and he continued by making other accusations against Jehovah’s witnesses and said that he should call the police. The sisters listened patiently and then one said, “Do wolves attack sheep or sheep attack wolves?” When the man agreed that it is always the wolves who attack, the sister replied, “Then who is attacking whom on this television program? Is it the wolves being attacked by the sheep?” The sisters then had opportunity to answer some of his questions, and arrangements were made for a back-call. Later during the week this same man was again watching the television program about us with a friend and he noticed that his friend was troubled by the false statements being made. He asked why and found out that his friend was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. This was a surprise to him as his friend had never mentioned it before, and now he determined to have a study too. So, to the surprise of the two sisters upon returning for the first back-call, the man asked if he could have a study to learn more about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to the arrests of the brothers, one court trial has already taken place and there will be several more within the next few months. In the first trial, two brothers, accused of holding illegal meetings, had been arrested at their homes and held for three days in prison. A few weeks after being released they were to appear in court. On the day of the trial the judge was amazed to see the courtroom full of spectators who had come to see the results. In Portugal such court cases usually take only a few minutes to be tried, but the judge was so interested that this one lasted for almost three hours. During the trial the judge quoted from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and asked questions concerning several Bible subjects. Three brothers gave a fine witness and the verdict proved to be “Not guilty.” A victory for Jehovah’s people and true worship!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,832,677</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 58 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 83,322</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For several years the Society had received a number of subscriptions from a small village in the interior, but when the subscriptions expired no renewals were made. It was impossible to have anyone make the back-call personally, so the Branch wrote directly to one of the subscribers concerning the renewal. What joy it was to receive an immediate answer asking for a renewal of eight subscriptions and for all the latest literature! The letter said, in part, “There are seven of us here who would like to be baptized and go out into the field service just like </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">says, but we don’t know how. Could you help us?” Their call for help has been answered and there are seven more publishers regularly preaching each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Protestant churches are active in Angola and they continually try to stop the progress of Jehovah’s people. Two families who were studying with Jehovah’s witnesses were told that we were a “diabolic sect” and that they should speak with the Protestant minister. The two families agreed, but on one condition: that one of Jehovah’s witnesses should be there also. The main subject of this meeting was the trinity, and after several hours the “pastor” was forced to retreat and the two families are now Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AZORES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,867</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work in these smaller islands is difficult for several reasons. One is the difficulty in reaching the people of goodwill. There are no roads on the islands and sometimes several weeks go by without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> boat stopping. Another reason is the strong opposition by the dominant religion, the Roman Catholic Church. The following experience related by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> special pioneer gives some idea of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While going from house to house I met a very old lady who listened attentively to the message. Her neighbors had warned her against us, but this only heightened her curiosity. She mentioned that her son had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> Bible, and he was invited to sit in on the discussions. It wasn’t long before this humble old lady began to receive threats from the neighbors, and the son was finally told by his boss that if he and his mother did not stop their studying he would lose his job. His reply was that he would continue the study, and he and his mother have made fine progress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister on one of the other islands is very well known for her preaching work and spends many, many hours walking from one house to another as there is no transportation. When the recent ban was placed on our literature she knew that sooner or later the police would visit her, so she decided that the best thing to do would be to go to them. She went to the police station and said that she heard of the new order and would like to explain our work. She then demonstrated to the police how we go from door to door and then gave a full eight-minute sermon, placing some literature. They were very attentive and impressed by her frankness. They agreed that this was the work of God and not of men. Due to this sister’s sincere attitude there has been little trouble on the island, and the brothers continue active in the work of teaching and preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPE VERDE ISLANDS Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 25,714</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Cape Verde Islands, as in all the possessions of Portugal, the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses is banned and the government has taken a stand against God’s people. So, then, it did not come as a surprise when two foreign residents of these islands were told to leave, with no reason given. These two brothers had been very active in the preaching work and this has resulted in the dedication of two goodwill persons as well as various study groups throughout these tiny islands. The two brothers’ being ordered out has caused much talk among the populace and is giving a good opportunity for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic and several Protestant churches are very active on the islands and they use various methods in order to stop the people from studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Rather than give the people the water of life, the churches have emphasized the giving of material aid. When they learn of someone studying the Bible they threaten that person with the loss of these material things. Nevertheless, those who have the right heart condition have stuck to their determination to continue doing the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are publishing have been threatened with arrest and one brother was taken to the local police station for questioning. This gave him a good opportunity to witness and he was immediately released when he proved that the accusations against him were completely false. These experiences do not discourage but only help to increase the zeal and determination of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The shortage of literature due to the recent ban has not stopped the brothers in their zeal and determination to preach the good news of God’s kingdom. The brothers set out for the door-to-door work with only the Bible in their hands. After the three-to-eight-minute sermon is given arrangements are made to call back on interested persons. The little literature that the brothers do have is then placed with the most interested people on the back-calls, and from these, studies are developed. Even with this difficulty the congregation has had a splendid increase in the number of publishers for the recent service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SAO TOM® &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even though the brothers in Sao Tome have little contact with their many brothers throughout the world, they continue to show remarkable spiritual health, as can be seen by their letters to the Branch. By means of correspondence they have been shown how to meet regularly for study and how to carry on the preaching work in a more systematic way. They are thankful to Jehovah and his organization for this help, as can be seen by their increased activities in the face of opposition by their taskmasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The island is made up of coffee plantations and the workers live in compounds, the rest of the island being nothing but jungle. This does not stop the brothers from going from one compound to another for meetings or for service, even though it may be dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,349,544</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There are very few areas where the truth has not been spoken in Puerto Rico. How true the words of the Bible are that when diligent work is done good results are forthcoming! King Solomon said: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.” (Eccl. 11:6) Throughout the island of Puerto Rico, on Tortola and the Virgin Islands there has been good sowing and good reaping. Here is the report from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The help given by Jehovah’s organization is made manifest in many ways and one way is that it helps the young publishers to give fine testimonies in the schools. One publisher was given an assignment to prepare a composition on a subject of her own choice. She chose the subject of juvenile delinquency, citing many Bible texts. She had to read her composition to the class at school and, with the theocratic ministry school training, was able to make a fine presentation. When she finished, the class applauded her. She was asked what her religion was and where she had obtained such good information. She explained that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines had helped her. Full marks for the composition would be 100 or “A,” but the teacher said that she would receive 200 or double “A.” The teacher stated that it was evident that the composition was the work of a Christian girl, for she had never heard the like before. This young girl was then asked to present her work in the library, and now the teacher said that she would try to gather together some of the parents of the children in the class in order that the young student might present her composition to them. Truly it can be said that the young servants of Jehovah can give a fine testimony to His praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the government has done much to overcome the problem of illiteracy, there are still those who cannot read and write, and these must be helped to learn the truth. A brother made a back-call where he had left some literature with a young married couple. The husband stated that he could not read, so could not study the Bible. The publisher tactfully explained that the man was still young and so could easily learn to read, to which the man replied that he was too busy to go to school now. Upon learning that the brother would teach him to read he was delighted and his wife also became interested, although a spiritualist. The study progressed well and soon this young man could read and was also progressing in knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. After a while the couple moved and the brother lost contact with them. How joyful the brother was to meet these young folks at a circuit assembly and learn that they were both now publishing!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The following experience shows how love can help people of goodwill take a stand for the truth. A lady who for some years opposed the truth and who did not want her husband to study decided to find out what makes Jehovah’s witnesses so zealous, peaceful and happy. Seeing the great change in her husband, who was then baptized, she agreed to a family study, with her husband often conducting it. Within a few months she became a strong supporter of the truth, zealously sharing in the house-to-house ministry as a regular publisher. Even though living a great distance out of town and having to travel over rough mountainous roads, she and her husband and little girl meet with the brothers to share in the group field service activity. She comments that she has at last found the true religion after having been associated with a number of other groups in search of the true worship, but which, she said, only taught her hatred instead of love for Jehovah. Her home, she said, has never before been so happy and peaceful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two fine new Kingdom Halls are being prepared and this will give added impetus to the work of gathering in the “other sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man who was well known in various villages for his old-world way of life began to study the truth. His “wife” and nine children also studied, but due to the fact that they were not legally married this couple could not participate in the preaching work. The matter of Jehovah’s righteous requirements was put before them and soon they were helped to legalize their marriage. What a surprise it was for the people to see this man first begin studying the Bible, then legalize his marriage after so long a time, and then go from door to door, Bible in hand, preaching and teaching the good news of God’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one congregation alone, five couples have legalized their marriages in the past thirty months, thus giving a fine testimony to the cleanliness and uprightness of Jehovah’s visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA LEONE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Sierra Leone appreciate that everyone has to take part in the training program. They look at it this way: Either we want to be helped, or we want to help someone else. The work keeps them occupied. Preaching the good news and doing the training work for aiding others has proved beneficial for the brothers during the past year. The branch servant has sent in some experiences that took place in Sierra Leone, Gambia and Republic of Guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the blessings of the year was having our own marriage registers for all the provinces throughout the country. For five years requests had been made to the government to have marriage registers for the brothers up country, but each time we were told our meetings places did not qualify as “churches.” However, in April of this year our request was granted. Now we have marriage registers in seven districts throughout the country, and this will enable the brothers and persons of goodwill to legalize their marriages and prepare themselves for baptism so they can become publishers of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a difficult thing to train people who have been born and reared in superstition and denied an education and bring them around from their old customs to following the simple teachings of the Bible. The following experience shows how this is being done in Sierra Leone. Among the Kissi-speaking tribe there is a secret native bush society for the men called “poro.” In one village where the brothers were holding regular Bible studies with a group of prospective publishers, the head man of the bush society made his attack on these newly interested people. With his supporters, this “poro” headman arbitrarily tried to force them to join in demonic worship, rites and celebrations. They were beaten, their houses burned, their property confiscated; some of the brothers were tied with chains in the bush, imprisoned and starved. The paramount chief sat back registering approval and support for the violators. The brothers then reported the case to the police and quickly a group of policemen was sent to the scene to investigate. Upon arrival at the village the police found that all the culprits had run away and taken cover in the bush. Luckily enough, they were able to lay hands on some of the leading gangsters, including the paramount chief, whose ruling staff has since been taken and given to another rightful man. Matters now boomer-anged—the paramount chief and some of his elders, together with the “poro” headman, were put in custody for several days pending court trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;311,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 28,273</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The little group of publishers is doing its best to meet the spiritual needs of the people. Exceptionally great is the need for more workers. The Society sends the circuit servant from Sierra Leone regularly to serve the one congregation and the two special pioneers, and this is greatly appreciated by the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gambia was one of the countries represented at the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in London, and it is hoped this will be the means of encouraging the local publishers to continue preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GUINEA Population: 2,500,000 Peak Publishers: 75 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 33,333</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Work in this African country of Guinea continues to grow. There are all kinds of obstacles and difficulties to meet, but the brothers stand firm. Good progress was made during the year, resulting in a 19-percent increase in publishers. Not only did new ones take up the good news, but those already in the truth and publishing grew stronger, and greater maturity can be seen in all the congregations and isolated groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some progress was made during the year in the literacy class and a number have learned to read. As more brothers become mature, more attention can be given to the illiterate ones, as this is really the big problem to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,750,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">At the close of the service year a new nation comes into existence. The four countries under the Singapore branch have just merged and the nation of Malaysia was born. The people are celebrating this occasion and are looking forward to great prosperity. In the meantime Jehovah’s witnesses keep on peacefully preaching the good news and winning the people of goodwill to the side of Jehovah’s established kingdom. Here are reports and experiences from Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak, as they were known before Malaysia was formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The biggest theocratic event that took place in this territory was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. We are reminded of what the apostle Paul said at Romans 1:12 regarding an “interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” Every feature of it will long live in the memory of the brothers. The five glorious days, packed with activity, association and spiritual food, went by so quickly it seemed as though we had shared for a short time in a world relay race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister relates this experience: “My husband and I were baptized Presbyterians and were active workers in the church. Due to dissension we stopped going to church, coming into a spiritual vacuum, as it were. It was then that one of Jehovah’s witnesses called on me and I immediately began studying the Bible with them. Remembering that my husband had burned some books of the Society in 1941, I was not surprised when he refused to heed the message and forbade me to go witnessing. He especially forbade me to teach the children this doctrine. He insisted they go to Sunday school. It was then I appreciated Peter’s counsel at 1 Peter 3:1, 4: ‘Be in subjection . . . that . . . they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives.’ I let the children go to Sunday school, but taught them the truth at home. Every Sunday the father took them to the movies. He got his first shock one Sunday when the children refused to go to the movies, saying that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study was more important. Another jolt was soon to follow. I took an active part in the ministry, being subject to Jehovah’s will. I postponed baptism, hoping that my husband and children might be with me. Finally the children began following me in the field service, and I decided to symbolize my dedication by water immersion. By this time my husband began to realize that there must be something in this religion, as two of our children were also baptized. It was my turn for a shock now, as he asked for someone to study with him. Our cup of blessing is now overflowing because he was baptized at the ‘Everlasting Good News’ Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We all appreciated very much having Brother Franz and Brother Suiter with us for a few days and this was another encouragement to us to continue spreading the good news farther afield, knowing full well for which God we are witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,100,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Are you inclined to shy away from territory that is rough and where the people are not too well educated? A Chinese-educated special pioneer did not feel that way. He combed through his rough hillside territory and searched out a “sheep.” A regular study was arranged and soon the “sheep” came to meetings and took part by commenting. When the pioneer invited him in the service he came willingly and has averaged ten hours a month since. He traveled five hundred miles with a group to the Around-the-World Assembly and stood with the other twenty-one candidates and answered the two questions in Chinese and was immersed. He now plans to vacation pioneer, but before filling in his application he resigned from his printing job and took up another job that would give him more time for preaching. What a joy this pioneer would have missed if he had not thoroughly worked the territory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTH BORNEO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;454,328</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is good news to be able to report that on the eastern side of North Borneo a new congregation has been formed with fifteen publishers. These brothers had been scattered in different parts of the country, mainly in logging camps. With the formation of the new nation of Malaysia some political trouble has arisen and some of the brothers have sent their families back to the Philippines. The remaining brothers, though sacrificing better jobs, moved into one place to be together, and the blessed result is the forming of a congregation. How happy they are to be able to hold all meetings in their own Kingdom Hall and feel the benefits of encouraging one another in love and right works!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SARAWAK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;750,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Sarawak is a land of few roads and many rivers. The only way to travel is by boat or airplane. A schoolteacher from the capital, Kuching, says: “From time to time new groups of students come in from outlying areas in remote jungle villages to learn to be schoolteachers. We often meet them and they eagerly take literature and show interest. On returning to their homes they take the literature back to their villages. The Society’s publications get where the Witnesses have never been. My own brother sometimes makes long trips up the rivers in connection with his work and distributes the Iban tract that was translated by my father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 15,841,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The branch office in South Africa looks after the work of a number of countries. There is not only South Africa itself, but Basutoland, Bechua-naland, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. In these territories there are a number of languages spoken, and the printing plant that we have in Elandsfontein is now printing twenty-two issues of magazines each month as well as thirteen issues of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font8"> Many of the magazines go to other branch offices in countries in the southern part of Africa. The work is very interesting in this section of the earth, and here are some experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Assemblies played a prominent part in our activities during the past year. South Africa had a share in the “Everlasting Good News” Around-the-World Assembly. About a hundred brothers traveled to London. A considerable number were helped to attend the London assembly as a result of the generous donations made to the travel fund. Those so helped were very thankful for the assistance rendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The films continue to do good work. A district servant was recently introduced to three new publishers who became interested as a result of seeing one of the Society’s films. Within a year after seeing the film they were publishing. Incidentally, this brother showed the Society’s films at forty-four different places with the aid of the power plant. Apart from the witness the films gave and the education they gave the brothers, they also helped him to get into Bantu areas where it was difficult to enter before. Once the people had seen the film, and since it was free, it was easier in many cases to get permission to enter and work with the brothers or hold an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although many of the brothers in this country have little worldly education, they have a sound knowledge of the Scriptures and with Jehovah’s spirit backing them up they are able to convince better educated ones what the Bible teaches. For example, the headmaster and his schoolteacher wife kindly accommodated the circuit servant and his wife during the week of the circuit assembly. They also offered the use of their house for the Tuesday evening talk. Although there were only a few publishers working this location over the past ten years, thirty-five goodwill persons came; in fact, they did not want to leave. Both the headmaster and his wife attended the assembly. Now they are convinced that they had been hearing the truth for the past ten years from these few poorly educated brothers, but only now could they appreciate it in all its purity. They remarked, “Now we can see clearly how we were deceived by the clergy in this location. They were always scoffing at these uneducated brothers, yet there was always something that these brothers had that made us want to continue to listen to what they had to say. Now we know what it is. It is the truth!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazine distribution is certainly an excellent way to introduce young people to the joys of field service. About four months ago two children of a family who were having a home Bible study also joined the study. They made rapid progress. Soon they indicated they wanted to go out in the service. The oldest one went with a special pioneer. They did four doors together, after which the youngster felt ready to do it alone. What joy was his by the end of his first day in magazine service to find he had placed 153 magazines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Going where the need is great takes faith and determination but has many blessings. One brother, hearing of the need for mature assistance in an eastern Transvaal town, planned to go. Having a family of four to care for, he found it hard to move until he asked off from work to attend a district assembly, and his firm gave him the option of quitting his job or missing the assembly. This decided it for him; he quit his job, went to the assembly and moved where the need was great. The effort was blessed from the start. In his new employment as a salesman he often took first place for sales. The house that he was offered had a large room suitable for a Kingdom Hall holding forty people, and it was soon filled by his family’s combined efforts to contact and help some long-inactive publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BASUTOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;641,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 211 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,038</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the last assembly in the capital, Maseru, it was indeed wonderful to see so many of the brothers bringing all their children with them. Due to their very large families, many African brothers do not bring their children. However, one congregation said, “We must come as family units to worship Jehovah. So we have made an extra effort during the last few months to save enough money to bring our children.” One sister was determined to come, even though the other two sisters in her group were ill. So she rode along on horseback for three days, then one day by bus, in order to come from the interior. She arrived three days before the assembly began in order to enjoy fellowship and engage in preassembly work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BECHUANALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;296,851</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Much can be done by incidental witnessing if one is alert to embrace opportunities. After placing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> with a shopkeeper for whom he worked, a newly dedicated brother placed one book among the groceries to be seen by everyone coming into the shop. When a person asks, “What book is this?” he merely quotes the contribution and avoids discussion. If a person takes the book the publisher obtains his name and address and arranges to pay him a visit to explain the purpose and use of the book. In one month by keeping one book on display he placed twenty bound books and reported twenty-five back-calls, and continues to do well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a custom in Bechuanaland for parents of a boy to pay a deposit of $12.00 plus a blanket and a dress for the girl whom they wish their son to marry. This is done when she is ten years of age. Thereafter the boy’s parents continue to support the girl until she is ready to be married. This is done without consulting the girl or ascertaining whether she loves the boy or not. Recently a flfteen-year-old girl came to a knowledge of the truth and informed her parents that she did not wish to be unequally yoked with an unbeliever. Her parents tried to force her in view of the money already paid for her, but when she successfully convinced them from the Scriptures that such an arrangement was wrong they agreed to let her have her way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. HELENA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,600</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event on St. Helena island during the past year was the visit of a circuit servant and his wife from the Republic of South Africa. Arrangements were made for this couple to spend a month with the brothers on the island. There was a record attendance for the island at the public talk of 121, and 117 stayed for the final talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the shopkeepers were cautious about putting up the posters for the public meeting, insisting that they had to be put up in inconspicuous places. Imagine the surprise of the brothers when they called at the police station and found the officer there willing to put up a poster right in the centre of the main door, removing some government notices to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the favourite dishes on the island is blood pudding. A schoolboy Witness was visiting the home of some friends. They tried to force him to eat, and when he refused they scoffed at him. But he stood firm and a good witness was given, for soon the whole island learned of his stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people are afraid of the truth in one district and always run away as they see the brothers coming. Evening work with magazines will be done there in the future. Then the people will not see the brothers coming and a witness may be given in that way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In the African field the work is slowly but steadily progressing, with many persons learning the truth from their European employers and then returning to their homelands, taking the truth with them. One dedicated brother who had thus returned furnishes a good example of the tenacity and faithfulness displayed by such ones when they really understand the truth. Having returned to his homeland, nothing was heard from him by the brothers for some months, until one day one of the European brothers, a bus driver who regularly has to go into Ovamboland, found him waiting at the bus halt in the northern part of Ovamboland. Knowing that the European brother was bound to come there sometime, he had been awaiting this brother’s arrival for a whole week. He had traveled 250-odd miles by bus and walked another 50 miles through lion-infested country during a flood season when roads were practically impassable to reach this place. The reason? His subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> had expired and he wanted to renew it! He then waited another week, during which he did witnessing, so that the European brother could go home and bring him some magazines for witnessing when he returned. He is now reporting as many as seventy-five hours a month to the nearest congregation in the northern part of South-West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SWAZILAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;237,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two special pioneers were sent to a new assignment where there were no Witnesses. It was a goodwill Catholic who opened his home and gave them accommodation. His entire family soon showed interest. A study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book began the very first day, and by the end of the second week husband, wife and daughter were sharing in field service with the pioneers. The principal meetings were soon organized, and now they and another family have progressed to the point of dedication, planning to be immersed at the next circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Working in one section of his territory, the circuit servant and his wife met a woman of goodwill who manifested interest in the message and finally took the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> A study was started. Later on the woman responded to the invitation to the meetings. This quickly drew the attention of her former religious associates who came around her home to attack her with rebukes and questions such as, “Will you go about with these people who always engage in talking?” Her answer was, “I will also imitate the same talking as long as it is Biblical.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTHERN RHODESIA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,013,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The biggest event of the year in Southern Rhodesia was the large national assembly they had at which there were 12,880 persons who heard Brother Henschel speak. Conventions of this kind are necessary because sometimes those dedicated to Jehovah God grow weary. This is no time to be growing weary. It is a time for feeding upon spiritual food to keep oneself strong to preach the “everlasting good news.” Here are a few experiences from Southern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the time of the national assembly in April, stress was given to the need for more personal study of the Bible, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and other publications of the Society. This counsel has been followed by many, and we are happy to report that now many more of the publishers are subscribing for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for use in personal study. We are confident that this trend will strengthen the faith of our brothers and enable them to withstand all onslaughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the old world many people who have ailments just give up with the feeling that they cannot be of any use or help to others, but not so with members of the New World society! A crippled sister relates: “It was always my desire to pioneer, and to this end I tested my physical strength by building up my hours every month. Then I saw in one of the Society’s publications an experience of a sister who was bedridden and yet served as a pioneer, and this helped me to make a definite decision to apply for vacation pioneer service myself. First of all, I applied to be a vacation pioneer for two weeks. I enjoyed it so much and got quite a few replies to the letters which I sent out, with the result that I applied for an extension of my pioneer service for another month. I am happy to be continuing in the pioneer service now.” This sister, before pioneering, suffered a stroke, which affected her right hand; so she overcame her problem by learning to write with her left hand instead and thus continue her witnessing, which is mostly done by writing letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 30,093,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Courageous ministers in Spain have moved ahead wonderfully during the year despite the continued government and clergy opposition, as well as other obstacles. Outstanding in the year was the Milan assembly where many of the Spanish brothers could be in attendance. What a blessing it was for them! Then, too, they were able to get the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> in the Spanish language. Our brothers in Spain have had a glorious year, and rich blessings have been their portion. Reports have come from Spain, Canary Islands and Andorra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year many more brothers have come to appreciate the door-to-door ministry, and many good experiences and blessings have been received. A pioneer working from door to door in Cadiz noted a small door in an attic apartment, which appeared to be uninhabited. The pioneer decided to make sure by knocking, and she was rewarded when a person manifesting interest opened the door. After making several back-calls, a study was started with the woman’s son and his fiancee. Soon they were attending meetings, and during the circuit servant’s visit they were baptized. Their next step was the vacation pioneer service, and now both are serving faithfully as regular pioneers. How fortunate it was that the pioneer did not overlook an apparently uninhabited apartment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers keep in mind the proverb: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it,” and this especially applies to incidental preaching opportunities. On Thursday of Spain’s “Holy Week” celebration a woman entered the taxi of a brother in Madrid, explaining that it was her intention to visit seven churches as is the custom for that day. Sensing that the woman was a sincerely devout Catholic, the brother tactfully started a conversation about Bible topics that lasted two hours. Then a booklet was placed, and arrangements were made for the brother’s wife to help her to increase her Scriptural knowledge by means of a Bible study. Later the woman noticed the announcement in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> placed with her concerning the 1963 “Everlasting Good News” Assemblies, and when she asked if she too could attend, she was invited to make the trip in the brother’s taxi. So just four months after first hearing the truth, this spiritually starved person was able to drink in eight days of nourishing spiritual refreshment at the Milan assembly, all stemming from an incidental witness given in a taxi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year there has been police action against the Christian activities carried on in at least twelve provinces. More often than not brothers are arrested in their homes rather than while they are participating in their ministerial obligations. Almost invariably the charge is that of violating Spain’s “spiritual unity,” even though Spanish law guarantees freedom to other faiths, thus negating that such “unity” exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thrilling announcement concerning the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> in the Spanish language was received with great enthusiasm, and the brothers look forward to using it in the field. Excellent prospects for future increase are indicated by the fact that 6,223 persons attended the Memorial, a figure that is more than double the number of publishers, so there is no doubt that with Jehovah’s blessing, the knowledge of him will continue to expand in this land, which has been held so long in the darkness and bondage of modern-day Babylon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Located on the south slope of the eastern Pyrenees, Andorra covers an area of just 191 square miles, which makes it the world’s fifth-smallest nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With great joy, three persons knowing the Catalan tongue began to serve the great need of the Andorran people during this service year. Overcoming the many obstacles involved regarding secular employment in such a small country is not an easy task, especially since the area is completely snowbound during a large portion of the year. Nevertheless, the brothers have shown endurance, and Jehovah has blessed their efforts to continue in their theocratic assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Andorrans are a traditionally independent people; so it is hoped that many will come to know the truth that truly sets one free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Catholic priests continue their harassment of the brothers, even to the point of using mob action tactics. On Sunday, February 17, two brothers who started working their territory noted that they were being followed by at least eight persons. They stopped to speak to a friend who was sitting in a car, and they were quickly surrounded. The license number was written down. Then the brother recognized the leader of the group and approached him directly. The leader sheepishly admitted that more than fifty had been organized that morning to go in gangs to all the city’s neighborhoods to seek out and disturb any of Jehovah’s witnesses who might be found preaching. Often priests especially train little children to report our Christian activity to the local parish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other cases fines and threats of deportation have been made. A police official told one brother that the only way to avoid deportation would be to “shut up and do your worship only in private with your family.” The brother cited Article 12 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fuero de los Espanotes,</span><span class="font7"> which guarantees freedom of speech, and he mentioned specific cases of many in the city who had cleaned up their lives, thus resulting in moral good for the community. The official listened, but reiterated that some action would have to be taken because of the strong complaints that he had received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SURINAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;291,815</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Twenty-nine delegates from Surinam were able to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in New York. They returned home filled with joy, and all this has had a good effect on the work in the country. The brothers have been encouraged to work up a regular schedule in order to spend at least ten hours a month in the field ministry. Excellent progress was made in this regard in Surinam during the past year. It is a joy to see the increase in this land, and here are a few experiences from the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three new congregations were established, one of which is entirely composed of Bush Negroes. In all there are now ten congregations in Surinam. Especially in the interior the work is going ahead steadily, and in spite of difficult traveling connections, much preaching work is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The building of a new branch office, missionary home and Kingdom Hall in the capital city, Paramaribo, is going ahead, and the brothers, who are building it themselves, hope to be finished within the next service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the truth can actually help to heal one is evident from the following experience. A person of goodwill became an invalid due to a terrible sickness and also suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure. Because of these complications she was subject to terrible fits of anger regularly. When she learned the truth she seized it as medicine. When she felt an attack coming on she took her literature bag and went into the service, hobbling from one address to the other. The more she busied herself helping others, the fewer attacks she had. She is now baptized, and, although seriously ill, she has had no more attacks and she is a regular publisher who enjoys the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s suggestion to call on the weaker ones has also had good results in this country. A young sister who had become entirely indifferent was visited several times by the congregation overseer and his wife. Spiritually upbuilding conversations were carried on and finally she went to a meeting again where she was so encouraged that she has not missed one since. Also, she began to preach again and even became a zealous publisher who already has spent three months in the vacation pioneer service and has no idea of stopping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,581,237</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,056 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 754</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The really big event of the whole year in Sweden was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly at Stockholm. The gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses, particularly from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, and from around the world, aided greatly in giving a good witness to the people of Sweden. The branch servant reports that those persons traveling around the world who went from house to house while attending the convention in Sweden made a deep impression upon many of the Swedish people. This has been Sweden’s best year in field service, too, and in their spending time preaching the good news of the <a name="bookmark211"></a><a name="bookmark212"></a>Kingdom. They have had some fine experiences and a few of them are printed herewith as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An outstanding event was the campaign with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Word”</span><span class="font7"> booklet, of which we sent out no less than 137,699 copies. The thorough study of the subject that was presented in this booklet made a good impression on several of the clergy, although others were too haughty even to read anything issued by our Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one town three Witnesses live in the Old People’s Home. The nurse in charge allowed a circuit servant to give a talk there, which caused an investigation by the authorities. The nurse then stated that there are various religious bodies represented in the home, but none are being looked after so well by their congregation as are these Jehovah’s witnesses, and none are reading their Bibles as they do. Their Bibles are always to be seen and they look well used. As a result the brothers are permitted to lecture regularly to the old people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general attitude among the people of Sweden is still very indifferent toward anything that has to do with the Bible, which is regarded as just “a book of fairy tales.” But sometimes the unconcerned mind may get awakened by an alert comment, as in this case: One man said to a pioneer sister who spoke to him about the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and mentioned about the rainbow, “That is nothing remarkable. I can make a rainbow myself with a jet of water in the sunshine.” But when shown from the book how that was impossible before the Flood because of the watery canopy, he got interested and asked to have the book. A study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief</span><span class="font7"> booklet was started, and soon the man finished reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise,</span><span class="font7"> whereupon he ordered the five publications there advertised and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done.”</span><span class="font7"> When these books were delivered, he said they did not cost him anything at all. How was that? Well, since he started to read our books he had stopped buying weeklies and crossword magazines, which had formerly cost him quite a bit. He subscribed for the magazines, and the pioneer couple were alert to help him prepare the lesson for study, and were very glad when he soon asked if it would be permissible for him to comment in the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;5,608,000</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark214"></a>It requires love, faith and boldness on the part of the brothers everywhere to preach the good news of the Kingdom. These qualities our brothers in Switzerland show. It is truly amazing to observe the actions of false religionists when a person of their organization receives the truth and what opposition is brought to bear against him. But with boldness and love for Jehovah God one can stand firm. Here is a very interesting experience in this regard sent in by the branch office in Switzerland. There is also a report on Liechtenstein.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience demonstrates how important and valuable incidental witnessing is: “One day a salesman called at my door. I was just in the middle of cleaning the apartment, and was hoping that no one would disturb me while at this job. But the bell rang and when I opened the door a salesman stood before me. Aftei’ I had given my order, I witnessed to him about our hope. He said it disturbed him somewhat that we did not venerate the saints or even the ‘Mother Mary.’ I showed him with the Bible that veneration of saints is not pleasing to Jehovah God, and we do well to believe only what the Bible teaches us. Then I gave him some magazines to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A few days later he called again and asked for further magazines. On this occasion I also gave him the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </span><span class="font7">The following Sunday he attended the public lecture and afterward subscribed for both </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> in the German language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At home he now met great opposition from his foster-mother. So one day I asked the congregation servant to accompany me to his home. We found him there, and his foster-mother was also at home, but she ignored us completely as though we were not there at all. Nevertheless, a home Bible study was arranged, which was taken over by a brother from the congregation. On one occasion when there was no opportunity to study in the kitchen or in another room, the brother just sat on the stairs out on the landing with this interested person, and this in spite of the low wintry temperature prevailing. So they sat in their winter coats and continued the study. This made a deep impression upon this woman, and she began to read the publications herself. In course of time and with much patience his foster-mother was also convinced of the truth. She began to take part in the study and soon officially severed her connections with the church. Now things began to move. The images and pictures disappeared together with the crucifix. The glass of the picture frames was used to mend the broken windowpanes. Now with her six other children, this woman compared the catechism of the Catholic church with the Bible. This she did almost every day. As a consequence, opposition from the Catholic population arose, bringing much harassment against this family. The young man, the salesman, who had first come in contact with the truth, wrote the following: ‘Here in . . . the Devil seems to be let loose, and oppresses us from all sides—the police, the teacher and sisters (Catholic), the neighbors and particularly our house owner—and all this because the whole family have severed themselves from Catholicism and have stopped going to church.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Meantime the study was continued. The young salesman moved into another territory and already shares in the service. The family, where he was raised as foster-son, have received notice to vacate their apartment because they openly identify themselves with the New World society. It cannot yet be seen how things will work out in the future. But they are not alone; the brothers in the congregation are at their side, supporting them, and Jehovah will have the final say in the matter. A way will be found for sure that they have a roof over their heads again, and Jehovah holds greater blessings in reserve for them, as they follow his leadings, than they would ever have hoped for themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How youthful ministers can contribute toward the Kingdom witness work is illustrated by the following experience: A schoolteacher asked his pupils to prepare a short talk to be given before the class, the subject to be treated being any book they had read. One of the boys, eleven years old, is the child of dedicated parents. The boy told his parents that he intended to give a talk on the Bible, and they supported him in this. He prepared his talk very well and the next day gave it in school. The talk was not only correct as to style, but the boy also used modulation and gestures as he had learned in the ministry school. When he had finished, the teacher commended him for it, saying: ‘That was good work!’ Then the teacher asked him whether he would care to give the talk a second time the following day, when he would record it on tape, so that his elderly mother at home could hear this talk, as she was interested in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this was not the only echo of this short talk on the Bible. The mother of the boy received a telephone call from the mother of a classmate of our youthful minister. She said that her son had been so enthusiastic about the talk he had heard in the classroom about the Bible, that she was now calling up to ask if the boy who had given the talk could give Bible instruction to her own son. The mother, of course, agreed to this, and since that time the two boys have regularly come together and our youthful Witness is holding a Bible study with his classmate. It takes courage to witness in school, but it bears fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LIECHTENSTEIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,757</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,845</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The few publishers in Liechtenstein have been growing to maturity. During the last service year three of them publicly declared their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. The Catholic church holds a strong grip on the population in this small country and it takes much patience on the part of the publishers here to build up faith in Jehovah and his righteous new order with the sheeplike ones so that they can stand the oppression and boycott that is put on everybody who severs his relationship with the Catholic church. It is like raising plants in an unfortunate climate. But we rejoice to see the number of Kingdom publishers increasing, as it is Jehovah who keeps making it grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,350 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 8,148</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The past service year has been one of cleaning and strengthening Jehovah’s organization in Taiwan. Maturity and an understanding of God’s Word are very important in gaining an appreciation of the fact that service to God is far superior to service to man. Our brothers in Taiwan are getting a better appreciation of their responsibilities as Christians, and good progress has been made during the year. Here are a few experiences that were sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year much effort was put forth to help the brothers of the Ami tribe get a clearer understanding of Jehovah’s organization and the need for each publisher to be able to give a witness himself,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rather than just go along and listen as has been the case with many of the publishers in the past. This has resulted in a number of these formerly counted as publishers no longer being counted, while those who are trying to become qualified publishers are getting more assistance and training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The highlight of the whole service year was the Shou Feng Around-the-World “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. Never have the brothers in Taiwan had an opportunity to realize so forcefully the love and unity of the New World society worldwide. Actually to see their brothers from so many other lands made an impression on their minds that will last for years to come. The public talk on the first day saw 1,566 assembled, listening to the talk by a member of the Taipei Bethel family. The peak attendance came on Monday afternoon, the second day of the assembly, when Brother Knorr spoke to them for an hour and a half on the subject “Everlasting Good News for the ‘Time of the End.’ ” At that time there were 1,922 listening as Brother Knorr also included timely counsel for the local brothers along with his prepared material. The brothers were very pleased when Brother Knorr released the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> in their own Amis dialect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher in the city of Hsin Chu, a little south of Taipei, writes the following experience: “When preaching in a small village outside the city I contacted a Chinese ex-serviceman who had heard of the truth before. He took the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book and all the other literature I had with me, and arrangements were made to study with him and his wife. When I returned for the study there were ten people waiting for me. The goodwill person first contacted could hardly wait for an opportunity to get baptized, and made excellent progress. Following his baptism the congregation has been able to form a service center at his home, and he continues zealous in the work.” The circuit servant comments that this person is very enthusiastic and is also serious-minded about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some parents hold back from attending the meetings because of their children, being afraid that they will make a nuisance of themselves. This was the case with one of the persons with whom a missionary in the southern part of the island was studying, but finally she was aided to attend the meeting. The result? The missionary writes: “That evening the study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book was about Jesus’ childhood, and her four children were very attentive. The next time I went to her home for their Bible study she was very happy and told me what had happened the day following their attendance at the meeting. When her eldest daughter, about eight years old, arose in the morning she immediately started to clean the home. When her mother asked her why she was so anxious to help, the child said: ‘Last night at the Kingdom Hall we learned how Jesus helped his parents, and I want to be like him. Besides, the Kingdom Hall was so neat and nice looking that I wanted our home to be the same way.’ The mother and four daughters have been to the book study every week since then.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAILAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 28,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 357 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 78,431</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all of southeast Asia there is tension. This does not mean, however, that Jehovah’s witnesses should be fearful and slow down in their preaching of the good news concerning God’s kingdom. Rather, it points up the importance of being more diligent in trying to reach all the people possible with the message of the Kingdom. So Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the world are pressing on diligently, and here are reports on Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Buddhist woman from a little village visited a relative in Chiengmai and found among the wastepaper a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom:'<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font7">She read it and found that it answered questions about death and spirits that she had often been wondering about. She read the booklet several times, and upon leaving town for her village she asked the relative whether she could take the booklet with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometime later at her village that woman heard about a lecture being given at a home in the neighborhood. She was too shy to go up into the house, but she listened from underneath the house and noticed that the speaker had the same message as she had found in the booklet. She started to study, joined in telling others about the good news and dedicated her life to do Jehovah’s will. Later her husband dedicated himself too, soon became a vacation pioneer and is now a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A study was being held with a Chinese woman who was always eager to share her new-found knowledge with friends. One of her friends, in turn, related these things to her husband. She said her husband was interested; so a back-call was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following week a study was conducted in Thai using the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font7"> booklet in Thai, English and Chinese. The man already had a Bible in English but ordered one in Thai for his wife to use. He accepts the Bible as true and almost immediately started telling his fellow Catholic workers of the things he was learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One territory had been covered many times in magazine work, and a young girl would take magazines every time a publisher would call. She was an orphan with no friends or relatives and not well treated by her master; so the truth appealed to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one occasion she tried to locate the branch office but failed. Since no one returned to help her understand the magazines, she wrote to the Society asking for help, even stating that she was willing to pay a membership fee if necessary and not too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher called and arrangements were made for a Bible study. She prepares her lesson well beforehand and knows the answers. She has come to the Kingdom Hall once and would like to come every week but, due to pressure from her master, she has been unable to do so as yet. She is saving her money for a Bible and is so happy at last to have someone explain the truth to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year concluded with the greatest assembly ever held in Thailand. The local brothers together with the brothers from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are very grateful for the hundreds of brothers who did not shun the expense and time to come all the way around the world to have fellowship and an exchanging of encouragement with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMBODIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;5,750,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 718,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A study was recently started with a young Catholic girl who had taken </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font7"> She showed good interest in the message. After a few studies she took the book to the nuns to get their opinion of it. Of course, you can imagine what the opinion was ■—do not study it yourself; we will do so and tell you all about it. But she kept on studying. When the nuns found that this girl had not stopped studying, they called her a heretic and gave the book back. Encouraged by her Buddhist father, she is continuing to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another interesting call was made on a couple who work for the U.N. They showed good interest in the message of the Kingdom as the only hope for mankind and asked many questions about the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses and the difference between us and the other religions. Then the husband made a very noteworthy remark about the U.N. He said the only way to describe it, as one seeing it from the inside, was “The Abomination of Desolation.” It was pointed out that that was exactly what the Bible called it and that soon it would collapse and fail completely. So many people still recognize man’s inability to remedy this world’s affairs and are looking for something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LAOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Up until one year ago there were no native publishers of the good news in Laos. Readers of last year’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> may remember that a Lao overseer of nominal Christians, together with several members of his congregation, was showing keen interest in the truth. Last November this man broke all ties with false religion and both he and his wife were baptized as dedicated witnesses of Jehovah. He has since taken up the pioneer service, and is causing the good news of the Kingdom to be made known with notable effect among both Christians and Buddhists. Moreover, the man who was appointed to take his place as overseer of his former church has also dedicated his life to Jehovah and he too is working toward the goal of pioneering. All together, there are now six native Laotian publishers proclaiming the good news in Savannakhet, and they average about sixty hours a month each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of our brothers have been having encouraging success in teaching Kingdom truths to Buddhists. A short time ago a young brother was calling from house to house when he saw that one householder was already engaged in conversation with a missionary representing one of the sects of Christendom. The householder was explaining that he was not interested in what the missionary had to tell him as he was a Buddhist and thus already had his own religion. After some minutes of futile discussion the missionary left; and our brother, not wishing to pass by even one person without giving him an opportunity to hear the truth, promptly went to the householder and introduced himself. He began his sermon by showing the importance of the present troubles in Laos and southeast Asia and how these very things correspond with the ancient prophecies of the Bible. This time the householder was very impressed and invited the brother to sit down and explain more to him because, as he said, “this is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘nah fang,’”</span><span class="font7"> that is, worthy of being listened to. Many people in this area have been making similar comments, and certainly the rich spiritual truths from Jehovah’s Word are proving more </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“nah fang”</span><span class="font7"> than the dry husks supplied by Christendom’s religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VIETNAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 14,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Ancestor worship is one of the strongest beliefs among the Vietnamese people. But when they accept the truth, whether they are young or old, they soon abandon such worship. This was the case for our flfty-two-year-old sister who abandoned her life-long practice of false religion and started a new life, conforming herself to do Jehovah’s will. After studying the Bible for about two years she knew that with the knowledge she had, she had to make a decision. She announced to her family she was planning to get baptized at the next circuit assembly. Her husband, who is of goodwill, said to their seven children, “Now look, children, today is a big day for your mother, and I want you all and myself to attend the baptism discourse and then witness the immersion.” This they did. After the immersion our new sister went out in the service. When she returned home from the service to supper the husband again said to the family, “We want to help mother live up to her vow to God; so we must cooperate with her. First, we will get rid of the incense sticks, which also means the ancestor altar. There will be no more burning incense in this house, as it is useless and a waste of money. We will also stop celebrating anniversaries of our dead relatives.” Since then the sister has been progressing very well. She has joined the ministry school, studies weekly with her children, attends meetings, and is regular in the service. Her husband is studying at the present and is doing well. We hope that he will soon follow the good example of his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;794,634</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The reports that came to the branch office in Trinidad during the year were very encouraging. It appears that the brothers tried to follow through on the instructions of the circuit servants and that they tried to cooperate in every way with the congregations’ servants. The overseers fully appreciated that it was necessary to do more than just tell the brothers what to do in the field. They realized they had to take the lead in doing the work. They had to be kind and patient and show the brothers what to do by setting the proper lead and working with them in the field. Overseers who are willing to take time to show others just how to do the work can reap fine results. The branch at Port of Spain sends in reports for Trinidad, Barbados, Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While a wife may at times win her husband without a word, many times words in season can help a husband who is not bitterly opposed to see the truth more rapidly. On working her territory, a sister met a woman who was well acquainted with the truth. She wanted the sister to meet her husband who was a Catholic and who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">might</span><span class="font7"> be opposed. “We arranged to call back, met the husband and answered many of his Bible questions.” A study was started. They attended the Memorial and began attending meetings, when the priest sent a Legionnaire to get them back to church. Asked why the priest himself did not come, he replied that the priest was too busy building a school. The woman observed, “It seems the priest is more interested in the school building than his parishioners, and if a young lady could walk to my home to teach me about the Bible, I cannot see why the priest cannot come.” She now accompanies the sister in the service while the husband who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">might</span><span class="font7"> have been opposed takes a keen interest in the truth and does some incidental witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Considerable attention has been given to encouraging young persons to remember their Creator by pioneering. This is as it should be. We must never think, however, that just because our days of energetic youth have passed pioneering is not for us. Many who have reached their three score and ten still have the strength to pioneer successfully by making a careful schedule so as to conserve their strength. Back in January, 1960, a sister seventy-seven years of age was appointed a regular pioneer. The rest of that service year she averaged ninety-nine hours. The last three service years she has averaged well over the 100-hour quota. One month this year she reported 131 hours, 134 magazines, 93 back-calls and 8 Bible studies. Other months are quite similar. Surely this sister, now in her eightieth year, should be an incentive to all congregation publishers, young and old alike, to reappraise their position and prospects of making a career of pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BARBADOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;232,085</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A sister from England passing through and attending a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study at one of the congregations was amazed to see the zeal of the brothers. Although the hall was cramped and very hot, she enjoyed the study and fellowship. She said, “In our congregation we have nice seats like they have in theaters and plenty of space, even a special room for the library; but we only get a little more than half the brothers to attend the meetings. What a contrast to see the brothers with these facilities still turn out in such numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In connection with meetings another encouraging feature of the year was the attention that has been given to repairing, purchasing and painting Kingdom Halls. Three congregations have bought their own halls and several others have definite plans afoot to secure their own Kingdom Halls in the near future. The brothers have discovered that the effort they make toward acquiring a Kingdom Hall gives them a stronger sense of responsibility and strengthens their unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The zeal of the brothers has aroused favorable comment from some ministers. An Anglican minister saw the brothers putting up a banner for a circuit assembly in the rain. The following Sunday he used this as a comparison between Jehovah’s witnesses and the lazy attitude of those in their ranks who, as he said, ‘only come to church to fill a seat.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQUIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The following experience well illustrates the aggressive attitude of the special pioneers in directing interested ones to the organization, in this case a sailor home on vacation who read the magazines. “My wife invited him to the book study that evening which he attended, and since that time he is attending all meetings. In January I began a home Bible study with him in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be Trust</span><span class="font7"> and taught him to offer the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines from house to house. The first day he placed eight magazines, while I placed four.” He joined the ministry school and gave many student talks. He even gave a public talk in his own village to an audience of 106 persons. For the past six months he has averaged 32 hours, 15 magazines, 5 back-calls and one Bible study. He is now waiting to get baptized at the next circuit assembly. The special pioneer truthfully observes, “It pays to invite all interested ones to the meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,766</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Pressure can be successfully endured and overcome when kind encouragement is given, as shown by this experience of a special pioneer: “When I called on one woman she told me that she knew all the Witnesses in the neighborhood and that she used to study with one of them. I seized the opportunity to resume the study. After a few studies with her, she started evading me. I continued calling, however, until she settled down to study once more. Four months later she voluntarily withdrew herself from the Anglican religion. Almost every member of the immediate family, including her husband who was away in England, persecuted her mercilessly.” She was on the verge of quitting, but was encouraged to endure by the regular study with the special pioneer. She attended the next circuit assembly and symbolized her dedication by baptism and is now a zealous Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GRENADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,034</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">After about a year’s study with a woman, her interest turned to local politics until she got a disappointment and renewed her interest in the study. On this particular day the missionary had sent his wife to conduct the study. The mother and three children were ready with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book. Knowing the mother’s capability, the sister said that, instead of a regular study, she would help the family prepare the sermon that Jehovah’s witnesses were using that month. She rehearsed it with the family as though they were all householders. Next she rehearsed it with the mother and had one of the daughters with her as though she was being trained in the field. Then she said, “'Well, Mrs.--, when do we</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">start?” The reply? “Tomorrow.” And tomorrow it was. Since then she goes out regularly, although she has eleven in her family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children often stimulate indifferent parents and cause them to realize the seriousness of the truth and to make an application of it in their lives. A study that had been discontinued was renewed with a woman whose daughter and granddaughter joined in the study. Little seemed to be accomplished until one day the girl refused to attend the Catholic convent to continue her education. She tactfully explained to her parents that the religious teaching she would receive there would conflict with her new-found faith. At this, the publisher who conducted the study reports, “I forthwith invited her to join me in the regular field service. The invitation was gladly accepted. Since then she has been sharing in the service regularly. This has caused the mother and grandmother to take the studies more seriously. It was a thrilling experience to see all three of them attending the entire circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. LUCIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86,145</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is a fact that one’s actions often give a silent and favorable witness where a verbal witness cannot easily be given. A sister who had been deserted by her husband for her Christian stand was forced by circumstances to go to work as a housekeeper not far from her neighborhood. Remembering her dedication to Jehovah, she followed Christian principles at work. This was soon felt. A pioneer writes: “I had tried to witness to her mistress before but never could. One day as I was returning home from the service I was stopped by a big smile and a friendly handshake. ‘I have to admit that your religion has made a difference in my life. Before your sister worked with me I never thought I could stay in my house when my husband was away. My house is so peaceful, and what is more my expenses have been cut down to almost half.’ I embraced the opportunity and gave a good witness; it was easy too. This was because the sister followed Christian principles at her work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Increase does not come easy; it comes by following up all interest. A lady invited a publisher to call on her mother, who was well known by the publisher; she was a staunch Catholic and an opposer. “I knocked at the door and was surprised when the lady’s mother opened the door and invited me in. I went into my sermon, which she listened to carefully. After making the offer I was more surprised when she said she would take a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> When I called back she encouraged her grandson to subscribe, and he did. She wanted to discourage the reading of comic books by the grandson, and she was successful; he destroyed them all on getting his questions answered from the Bible. He made fast progress in the study during the ensuing months and began to attend meetings and go out in the service. In six months he was baptized in symbol of his dedication. He is a regular publisher and has now sent in his application to be a vacation pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TOBAGO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,333</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“A little over a year ago I was assigned to work with an isolated group.” At that time their averages were very low. “The need, as I saw it, was to give personal attention and so as a start I singled out four sisters and a brother along with one of my most promising Bible students. I arranged to work with them Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Did it work? Yes, it did, and I am happy to say that my ‘labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.’ (1 Cor. 15:58) Three sisters together average sixty-two hours. The fourth, who has been irregular and not placing magazines, is now conducting a Bible study and placing some magazines and is a regular publisher. The brother is now capable of handling the magazine distribution among the publishers. Three of these sisters are now on the vacation pioneer list and my Bible student is attending the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study and goes out in the field service with us. So my advice to all is to give personal attention.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Another good witness was given in this country during the year. The congregations averaged a 10-percent increase in publishers and greatly improved their hours in the field service as well as their home Bible studies. All this activity brought fine results during the year. The branch office there also looks after the work in the Falkland Islands, and here are a few reports from Uruguay and the Falkland Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many years ago a man accepted a bound book from some pioneers only because of its attractive title about truth, but he never read it and put it away in his bookcase. Years later, other pioneers, this time special pioneers, were study-minded and started a study with this man’s sister, who mentioned to him about her study of the truth. He then remembered the book, went home and began to study it himself. He soon realized he needed more help, so he went over to his sister’s house and the special pioneers began a study with him. This was on Monday, and by Thursday he was in the Kingdom Hall and now is a mature brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For others it is a battle to come into the truth. A spiritualist who had gone as far as curing people by deep concentration found herself confused when her cult split itself into two divisions; so she then joined a semireligious cult called “Mother Mary,” and later she accepted a Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. After two studies she withdrew to her dark room to concentrate and try to discover which religion was correct. A demon spoke in favor of “Mother Mary” twice, and tried to get her to discontinue the Bible study, but the publisher did not give in and the study continued. The demon finally gave up one day when she threw out all her images of the virgin and never bothered her anymore. She is now a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FALKLAND ISLANDS</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Considering how isolated these English-speaking Falkland Islanders are, a lot of witnessing has taken place there off the coast of South America during the last few years. The Society has sent one or two missionaries a year down there from Uruguay since 1954 to stay a few months, thus giving a continual witness and at the same time helping five publishers to manifest themselves. Many of the inhabitants go back and forth to England. This year, in March, a family of three publishers moved back to England and in May an elderly sister who had spent all her life in the Islands sailed out, planning to move to Australia, so once again in 1963 these islands are without house-to-house preachers, but there are people of goodwill who study there and the cry continues to go out for help.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Venezuela enjoyed another fruitful year while proclaiming the “everlasting good news” in this changing country. Conditions have been unsettled in many parts of the land; so Jehovah’s witnesses have had the opportunity of preaching under favorable and unfavor<a name="bookmark215"></a><a name="bookmark216"></a>able conditions. In most instances the results have been excellent. Here are some experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary from La Guaira writes: “One morning while working from house to house I placed a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font7">book with a young housewife. I made one return visit before going on my vacation. When I came back I wanted to call again but found out that she had moved. The neighbor lady offered to take me to their new residence, which I willingly accepted. She received me cordially, but I was unable to say much about the truth because of the visiting neighbor. However, when I returned the next time alone, a study was started in the book. She had given the book very little attention, but after two studies I noticed that her interest had greatly increased. After the study she said: 'Could you come some evening, as my husband likes to read the Bible?’ This was arranged immediately and my husband and I were soon having a weekly study in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’ </span><span class="font7">with them. After a couple of weeks they appreciated the study so much that they wanted to come to our house to make it more convenient for us. We accepted this arrangement, as we had access to our theocratic library to answer their many questions. In the meantime the husband was offered a better job in another city, but he decided not to interrupt his study of the truth. This study was started in February and in May they went out in the service while attending their first circuit assembly. They have been regular publishers ever since. The study in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’</span><span class="font7"> was finished before both were baptized. They had enrolled in the school and are also participating in the service meetings. Now, a year after the offer of a better job, the husband was still able to take it, having moved to another congregation where he and his wife are a good help to the smaller group there. Only a little effort to locate a back-call brought these fruitful results.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another experience comes from the congregation servant in Acarigua: “A brother was studying with a couple for almost two years. They were not legally married and had not decided about the truth, the husband rather hiding when the time for study came. The study was given then to a sister. After noticing that the woman was not paying much attention either, the sister dropped the study completely. In the meantime another sister in the congregation asked for help in making a back-call on a man who had taken a magazine. When they went to the man’s house, only his wife was there and she told them that he liked the magazine very much and that he also had a book. Another call was made on the following weekend, and this time the husband was home. The book he had was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font7">book given to him by the man who previously studied for almost two years and who did not get married. A study was arranged in the same book with this newly interested person. He and his married wife studied nicely. In about three months the man had taken several other publications of the Society and three different Bibles, including a Catholic Bible, so he could compare them. In five months he was able to read the whole Bible and in three months he was attending the various meetings and now is an active publisher in the local congregation. He makes many back-calls and preaches the good news to others. This includes the man who gave him the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book at the beginning, who is now making definite arrangements to legalize his marriage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRTEEN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 101,452 Population: 418,629,000 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,126</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As God’s faithful servants in the earth read the report of the activity of their brothers in other countries they will fully appreciate that in order to be faithful one must have a clear knowledge of the truth and must want to associate with his brothers. It is just as the apostle Paul said, we cannot forsake the assembling of ourselves together, and those behind the Communist Iron Curtain and in other places of the earth where the pressure is hard against God’s witnesses must stand together, and they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These reports show that even though Jehovah’s servants face imprisonment, they are not slowed down from preaching the good news. Even though they have been in prison and are released, they continue to preach, just as Peter and John did after being thrown into prison and being released. Often Jehovah’s people are put back in prison, but this does not deter them in their faithfulness. They know that they have the words of everlasting life and that they must preach such in all the world for a witness. So we find Jehovah’s witnesses around the world faithful in fulfilling their responsibilities as dedicated servants of the Most High God Jehovah. Let the experiences that follow strengthen all of you to be faithful in your service wherever you are in the world. “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Albania the brothers meet with considerable difficulty in carrying on their worship and service of Almighty God. Even though they have been isolated for many years from contact with the brothers in other countries, nevertheless, they have maintained their faith and continue to tell the good news of God’s kingdom to others. They were able to celebrate the Memorial and are doing the best they can not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. Some field service reports have been received. It has also been learned at the end of the year that some arrests have taken place, but details are not known. We pray that our brothers in Albania will be of good courage as they continue in pure worship of the living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Bulgaria has made some progress in the past service year. A good number of people have come in touch with the truth and learned its elementary doctrines. A number of Bible studies have been started with honest and truth-seeking persons interested in the kingdom of God. Since this country is under communistic rule, no official activity of the Society is permitted. Much activity lies ahead in this Balkan country, and by Jehovah’s help it is hoped that the work can be built up and more fruits can be reaped in due time. The climate lends itself for such a harvesting of men of goodwill, but it needs workers, and these are few in Bulgaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Czechoslovakia have done a very good work in the past service year by Jehovah’s help. All their preaching has to be done underground. Jehovah made grow what diligent hands have planted and watered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A married couple witnessed several times to a certain family, but evidently without any tangible success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the next visit they decided to take their children along to this indifferent family. At the end of the Bible discussion held by the adults, the children were asked by their parents to present the Bible sermon on “Future of Man.” They did it well. The family was impressed and expressed their astonishment that children of that age are able to speak about God and his kingdom. They said in reaction to what they had seen and heard: “For many years we have been connected with our church, but we have never heard children having such knowledge about God.” They did not hesitate to express their sincere joy and said that they felt as if Jehovah himself had transmitted this message through the mouth of these children. And the result? Indifference was overcome and a home Bible study is now being conducted with this couple. “Out of the mouth of children . . . you have founded strength.”—Ps. 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite the constant danger of getting caught and imprisoned by the Communist authorities, the publishers have intensified their efforts to reach the people of goodwill. Quite a few took up vacation pioneering in various places during the summer and others moved out into new fields. They had many thrilling experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people seem just to be waiting for home Bible studies. A publisher who started out in a new territory was able to conduct six new studies within two months. One woman told her at her second call that she felt it a direction from God that the publisher came to her door. She had always been in fear of something unknown, but since she learned from God’s Word what mankind has to expect and how we can find protection from it her fears are gone. This woman’s heart was so filled with the newly found truth that she started to talk to her relatives about it, and now a cousin of hers is also showing great interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher calling at a home in a territory that had recently been thoroughly covered was asked, “You are certainly one of Jehovah’s witnesses; are you free again?” And without waiting for the answer the householder continued: “I am so glad, please come in!” The householder told the publisher that she had that impression because from all sides they had been telling her something about Jehovah’s witnesses. Of course, she learned that the ban was still on; nevertheless, she was very happy to be able to learn more about the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The good example of a sister encouraged others in her neighborhood to appreciate more their privileges. Patiently she helped others to accompany her in the service. She lost quite some time waiting for them or calling on them at their homes. But how happy she is now to see that one of the publishers whom she assisted is now himself just as busy conducting two Bible studies almost every night of the week. This brother is now taking along some new publishers and so the message is spreading into all corners of the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher moved into a new territory where the need was great. One day a woman was met in the field service who was a member of the New Apostolic sect. She had been searching for the truth all the time and had many questions. Whatever the publisher pointed out to her she eagerly checked in her Bible. She was of a very meek disposition. At once she recognized the falseness of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. She also saw the unscripturalness of the claims of the so-called apostles of her church. When at the next call the publisher pointed out to her in her own Bible the fruits that true religion is to produce, the woman, not yet knowing the identity of the publisher, at once said: “Then the Bible Students were the right kind of Christians. They had been doing these things. But what a pity they have been done away with.” How happy this woman was when she was taught from Gamaliel’s statement that man cannot destroy God’s work and that she was talking to one of those Bible Students or Jehovah’s witnesses. She gladly agreed to have a Bible study and quit attending her church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another town a publisher some time ago was called on by two officials of the Communist secret police. They offered her a book about Jehovah’s witnesses, written by an individual who had turned against the truth. The sister answered that such things could happen, because Judas also was a close follower of Jesus for a while, but then betrayed him for thirty pieces of silver. She did not need that book and she was not interested in reading it. She had her Bible to read. They then warned her that she had become more active recently and if she carried on like that she would soon find herself again where she had been before, in prison. She replied that such is a Christian’s course of life, and the apostles too had been alternately in and out of prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kindness is a very effective way to overcome the fears and distrust of the people, many of whom seem to be just waiting for the truth. A sister traveled to town on the railroad and talked to a woman who was from the same village. On her way back she again met the same woman. While they were on the train it started to rain. The woman had no protection, but the sister had a scarf and an umbrella, so she offered the woman her umbrella, telling her she would pick it up sometime. At that call she started to preach to the woman, made a back-call on her and began a home Bible study. After a while the woman sent the sister to her daughter who lived in another village who, in turn, also had her talk to her son. All three have made good progress and have left the church, and the son is now ready for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA ANH ERITREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Splendid increases have been made in the Kingdom work in Ethiopia during the year, particularly in the province of Eritrea. But this increase has not been without opposition. Early in the year four priests issued letters and also gave oral warnings to a number of Witnesses and people of goodwill to the effect that if they did not come to church on Sunday and renounce their association with Jehovah’s witnesses, their parents would be expelled from the church and they would have trouble from the police. However, encouraged by the yeartext, the brothers and goodwill persons answered the priests: “We are not coming. Do whatever you want to do; we are awaiting you in Jehovah’s name.” The priests did not follow up their threat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to the continued activity and zeal of the brothers, the opposition was intensified toward the close of the year. The local Coptic priests issued an order to their congregations not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses and if they had a child who was a Witness to put him out of the house, or if they were renting to a Witness to evict him or they would be excommunicated themselves. Due to the fear of the people, eighteen persons were forced to leave their homes. Clergy-inspired newspaper articles and even a public drama attacked the Witnesses and misrepresented their Christian work. Finally the police arrested a number of brothers for belonging to a “forbidden religion” and warned them that no more than two persons could gather at a time and that they must not preach. However, those who are faithful and courageous will never become frightened, but will remember the words of the angel to the apostles under similar circumstances: “Keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.”—Acts 5: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A minister of Jehovah was conducting a home Bible study with people of goodwill. One evening a monk was present. It was his belief that the way to win God’s approval was by wearing goatskins, begging money and isolating oneself from society. Surprised by the answers he got from the Witness to his many questions, the monk shared in the study and after a month threw away his dirty goatskin garments and bought new clothes. Now he is clean and well shaved and progressing nicely in the truth. Truly, “the word of God is alive and exerts power.’’ We are happy to see the work continue to progress in Ethiopia even under opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Hungary have worked hard in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Some brothers who were in prison have been released on the basis of an amnesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many families the youths present a real problem and this certainly is also the case in Communist countries where the children continually are exposed to the influence of atheistic communism. The problem is even worse when the father also exercises a Communist influence. A publisher started a Bible study with a woman, but not at her home, as her husband was a Communist and from the very beginning he brought up his children according to this atheistic ideology. In spite of this the younger boy, sixteen years old, started to show great interest in the truth, so his mother took him along to the Bible study. The older son, eighteen years of age, learned about these studies and he began to show a very hostile attitude. One evening when the study was being held this elder son approached the house where the study was conducted and through the open window he threatened his own mother and brother and the sister that if the study were not discontinued at once he would call the police immediately. But the study was continued fearlessly. Another time he came into the room where the study was held in order to talk to his mother. The publisher seized this opportunity and told this young man in very friendly but, nonetheless, in frank and direct words that Jehovah’s witnesses are not afraid of such threats: “We are on the right way and we know that the exercise of our faith brings persecution.” This conversation caused this boy to think. He stopped interfering with the study and, to the surprise of all, he began to attend the study regularly. At the beginning he did not give any comment, but after a time he participated in the study. From then on, the mother and the boys were very diligent in the study. Both boys changed their conduct. Formerly their mother suffered a lot on account of the disrespectful and rude behavior of these boys. Then the truth changed them. They became decent and polite. Recently all three of this family got baptized and they have become very diligent publishers. This shows how a firm attitude toward teen-agers may result in blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was no letup in court cases this year. About 130 trials w’ere reported, in which the cases of 150 publishers were handled and sentences passed summing up to 150 years. But only ten brothers were actually put in prison, because the other sentences were appealed. The strange fact is that the laws applied against the brothers are a special set of laws that were originally made for the sole purpose of enabling the government to fight dangerous criminal bands after World War II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After many years of silence about the issue, the Supreme Court has now finally ruled and affirmed the question as to whether that special set of laws may be applied to the cases of Jehovah’s witnesses. So it seems that the conviction of faithful Christians will continue without any alleviation. But the brothers feel like the first Christians who went their way from before the high court “rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name. And every day . . . they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the publishers learned about the world convention, they planned to have a share in this great witness by doubling their own effort during the time the convention was rolling around the globe. Many used their vacation or part of it to take part in working outlying territory, using tourist camps as a basis and reaching out from there to those places. As the territories were covered they moved on to another camp. In one village the priest, when learning that Jehovah’s witnesses had been in the neighborhood, told his church audience: “Let us now pray because the plague of Jehovah’s witnesses is flooding the whole land and many have erred from the truth.” Shortly thereafter the symbolic locusts reached that village and it was covered, with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Behaving differently from the rest of the tourists in those camps, the publishers soon roused the interest of the people. When some returned to their tents to rest a little they found that inhabitants of the town had come out to their tents, wanting to talk to them about Bible questions or to listen to them singing Kingdom songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It requires careful planning and a bit of strategy to successfully work territory where there is much opposition, as it is like touching an ants’ nest. A group of publishers worked a town in which publishers six years ago had been physically abused by hateful opposers. Every publisher had a certain section of houses assigned to him, and they all started at once. Everything worked out fine, as the town was taken by surprise. Only three pairs of publishers were stopped and escorted to the railway station, and they managed to distract the attention of the opposers from the rest. One other brother was followed by a police officer. In an unnoticed moment he took off his overcoat and hat, giving them to a sister. The police officer, not recognizing him any longer, let him pass by unmolested. The publishers were able to call on several hundred homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Preaching at cemeteries is a helpful feature of the service in order to get in contact with people. A sister who had been hesitant to do so happened to be at the cemetery for the funeral of a brother. She noticed a young woman with three children kneeling and weeping at the grave of her husband. The sister went to her and started to comfort her from the Bible. A back-call resulted and the sister found genuine interest, even with the woman’s mother. They are making good progress. Seeing this dire need helped the sister overcome her negative attitude toward taking advantage of this feature of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test, and that you may have tribulation ten days.” Our brothers in Romania recall this text in Revelation 2:10 as they consider their situation. A considerable number of brothers are in prison. The others have to be very vigilant and cautious, seeing that the pressure from the Communist government has not lessened. But in spite of these circumstances, the work in Romania has made some progress in the past service year. The publishers make use of every opportunity to spread the word of life. As a result a number of men of goodwill symbolized their dedication by water immersion, which, of course, had to take place secretly. Yes, everything that concerns the truth has to be done secretly, the witnessing, the meeting together, even the study of God’s Word. The brothers have to be on guard, not only against the police, but also against neighbors, fellow workers, relatives and family members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A person from the West who visited Romania related that, when he stayed in his home village there, a niece from a nearby village came to see him. She did not know that the visitor was in the truth. When they were alone, she asked him in a low tone: “Please tell me, what is the name of your God?” The visitor replied: “My God is Jehovah.” Upon this answer the niece embraced him and both had tears in their eyes, because the niece too was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The niece told him that most of the brothers she knows are in prison. “The authorities are very strict with our brothers because they speak the truth; but we all know that Jehovah does not permit something we would not be able to endure,” she continued. The niece told him that even studying is a problem. Since the other family members are not in the truth, she has to go somewhere outside, where she is alone, to read the Bible. If she did it at home, she would have to risk the danger that her Communist family would report her to the police. How thankful should all those be who can meet and study freely and have abundance of spiritual food at their disposal, compared with the few pages our brothers get in some totalitarian lands!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in Turkey enjoyed another fine service year filled with abundant blessings as well as tests of faith. One legal case from 1961 finally ended with the acquittal of two brothers involved, but there are still cases against Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Turkey. We hope that these will be settled favorably soon. It certainly requires faith to preach in a land where at any moment you could be arrested for carrying a Bible. But the Christians in Turkey must tell their neighbors and friends what they believe and what they have learned. They must go and disciple people of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Jewish lady of goodwill witnessed to her neighbor, a Moslem lady. This lady in turn talked to her Moslem friends about the Bible as a book containing important prophecies and about Jehovah’s witnesses. As a result, these two friends of hers expressed the desire to talk with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. An appointment was made. The resulting discussion about God’s new system of things and its blessings became very interesting and the ladies expressed appreciation for the prophecies explained. When one of the ladies said, “We Moslems accept Jesus as a prophet, but why do you not accept Mohammed as one?” the brother explained that if all the religious leaders were God’s prophets and their writings inspired by him, then the information contained therein would not be so contradictory to the words of Jesus. Also, why is the prophetic part missing from their writings? Since prophecy has to be fulfilled, other religious leaders of all times thought it advisable to abstain from uttering prophecies regarding the future of mankind and limited their teaching to moral principles, which again are not universally accepted as being of the highest standard, as is the case with the principles of the Bible. The ladies appreciated the explanations given and asked where they could find a Bible. Arrangements were made to meet them again and continue the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother related the following experience: &quot;One day my wife and I were waiting for a ‘shared taxi’ while on our way to a back-call. Finally, one came with just two vacancies left and while I opened the door to allow my wife to pass, a man rushed past and filled one vacancy. A little dejectedly we closed the door to wait for the next opportunity. Then we noticed a private car immediately behind and the man inside beckoned to us. A little surprised, I told our destination to him and he said he would take us. On the way I mentioned that world conditions and thoughtless people cause much unhappiness. He agreed and freely expressed his views, recalling the little incident we had just experienced. I took up the theme of world governments and found him quite concerned. We were nearing our destination and said we would like to continue our discussion when he had more time. When we visited him I had the opportunity to tell him who we were. He was quite happy, saying that he had spoken to a member of our group a long time before but was very busy and lost contact. He asked many questions and was glad to learn more about the worldwide preaching of the Kingdom. While we were speaking, his nephew came in and he too showed interest. Arrangements were made to start a study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book with him. Although they are Jews, they were glad to learn about an everlasting government under the rule of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the Communists tried to keep their Iron Curtain hermetically sealed off, a number of reports from our faithful brothers in Russia leaked out, in which they assure us that they feel closely united with us in worshiping Jehovah and searching for his “other sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The propaganda film “Armageddon” is being shown even in small villages. The Ukrainian newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Red Flag</span><span class="font7"> of May 14 reported such a performance in the village of Otinya. Before the actual showing began, a member of the atheist section delivered a discourse on “Who are the Jehovists?” in order to “prepare” the audience. The film itself is spun around a love affair of a boy and a girl. While he serves in the army, she is dragged into the ranks of the nonsense-believing Jehovists. The overseer of the group is exposed as a tool of the American espionage service. At the end of the picture the feeling of the audience is stirred to a climax through the accidental death of the little sister of that girl, which is caused by that wicked overseer. The paper concludes: “In such a way atheistic propaganda is effective, convincing, and it can be used in other villages of the country where similar films are shown.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although Jehovah’s witnesses, in newspapers, radio and films, are slanderously painted as a people that are dangerous agents and backward as regards the achievements of modern culture and science, the publishers do not get disturbed, but peacefully carry on, leading a quiet life and instructing other people about God’s Word, the Bible. They know that Jesus warned his followers of these very things when he said: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” Often the articles prove to work in the interest of spreading the message. In many instances the brothers have been able to give a good witness to the truth as a result of such articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The field is really getting ripe for the harvest. There are numerous people of goodwill, and the brothers employ various methods to get into contact with them, at churches, cemeteries and funeral processions. When people mourn for their deceased close relatives they are receptive to the comfort of God’s Word and learn about the resurrection hope. There are positive results. Other publishers go into public parks and other places where people gather for leisure, in order to find new opportunities to witness to people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often it is hard to witness to the people in their homes, as there is now a member of the Communist party or of the Communist youth organization or at least sympathizers of it in almost every home. The presumed incompatability of religion and science is at once made the subject of discussion. Atheistic propaganda, which is constantly showered down upon the people, causes many to lose their readiness to take an interest in the message of God’s Word. In the higher grades of the secondary schools Darwinism is taught extensively and the students have to agree with it if they want to finish school with good grades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When publishers were released from the Siberian penal camps after they had spent many years there, they were told that if they preached or made contact with people about the truth they would be sent back to Siberia. Many brothers have their passports marked, as they had been in prison for not serving in the army. A young brother who refused to submit to the draft was asked why. He told them that he was a soldier for the new system of things. He was put in solitary confinement for five and a half months and another five years and six months in various penal camps. In one of these camps he had to make bricks out of clay and he thought of the Israelites down in Egypt under Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two young Ukrainian brothers in a penal camp had to undergo many sufferings because they did not renounce their faith in Jehovah. When the authorities realized that they were not able to turn the brothers away from being Jehovah’s witnesses, they set a new test for them. They were ordered to work in an outside place where there were only young girls as workers. All day long they had to be around those girls. One of the two brothers fell into that trap. He did not stay away from the advances of a young girl and finally married her, giving up the truth. But the other brother proved steadfast. He paid attention to the Christian injunction to marry only in the Lord, and did not entertain any thought of getting involved with one of those girls. After a while he was sent back to prison and put on forced labor for an indefinite time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The publishers even have to contend with false brothers sent to them by the secret police in order to infiltrate the organization. One sister was called on by two “brothers” whom she did not know. They told her that they came all the way from Siberia and that they were sent by the brothers to find out how they were getting along. The sister asked them whether they had met any of the Jonadab family in Siberia. “No,” they did not happen to know them, they said. They had not passed this test, and when the sister asked them about a letter of recommendation and they mentioned that they had lost it on the way, she was sure about the true nature of the visitors. When they even offered her a brand-new </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine as proof of their identity, the sister sent them away without accepting the magazine, thus avoiding the trap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In submitting to you the U.A.R. annual report 1 am very happy to inform you that Jehovah has blessed us abundantly by increasing our workers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our religious opponents are many and powerful, and “had it not been that Jehovah proved to be for us . . . then they would have swallowed us up even alive.’’ (Ps. 124:2, 3) They keep accusing us falsely to the people so they will not accept our message of life, also accusing us before the “superior authorities” so that they will persecute us. Many of our brothers are watched by secret policemen and quite a few have been cross-examined by the Security and Investigations Departments’ officers, sometimes either being visited at their own homes or summoned to the departmental headquarters. During these interrogations they are threatened with jail or being fired from their jobs or both if they persist in rendering sacred service to the Almighty God according to the dictates of their conscience. It is not unusual also to order them to make a signed declaration stating that they will do no religious activity any more, or, to ask for names and addresses of other Witnesses in order to follow and watch them likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A study was conducted with an elderly woman for over three years and although she had a sincere heart, she was spiritually asleep and was not making any progress due to the fact that her son opposed the truth fiercely. Then one day, to her great amazement, her son asked her to invite one of Jehovah’s witnesses to their home in order to have a discussion with one of his friends who likewise studies the Bible. This proved to be a trick, because his friend was a well-known Catholic priest officially assigned to fight Jehovah’s witnesses and who had already had many discussions with Jehovah’s witnesses and goodwill persons. When the priest came he was accompanied by twelve of his disciples to cause confusion during the discussion and make the brother lose his temper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The subject of discussion most often used in Egypt is the trinity. The brother who was invited for this interview, having already discussed this with this priest other times, did not waste his time but proved very quickly the Bible’s point of view and withdrew from an unpolite atmosphere of insults and mockery. But what was the result for the goodwill person? The lady understood the difference between priests and Jehovah’s witnesses and where the truth lies, and said so in front of the priest and his twelve friends. She therefore started studying her Bible more thoroughly with the Society’s publications in order to defend her newly acquired faith in front of the attacks of this priest, who continued visiting her three or four times a week. After a couple of months the goodwill lady declared to her son with freeness of speech that from now on she would become a true witness of Jehovah, going from door to door, attending meetings and even getting baptized. When the priest heard that and saw her determination, after calling her many names, he ceased visiting her. This lady was recently baptized and became very zealous despite her advanced physical age. She now attends all congregational studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers in Yugoslavia live in a Communist country, but due to their having legal status they enjoy a certain measure of freedom, for which they are grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister conducted a Bible study with an interested woman whose husband, a stern Catholic, was very much opposed to the truth. Whenever he found a Watch Tower publication in his home, he burned it. This man is a member of the Communist party and, as such, occupies a leading position in a factory. Again one day he found a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine in his home. He took it and went straightway to the Communist party committee, to get advice from them as to what he should do to stop his wife from spreading such “false doctrines.” How surprised, however, he was when the two members of the committee replied: “Leave her where she is; that is good. At least this way you can be sure that your wife is faithful to you and does not go about committing adultery like our wives do. Really, Jehovah’s witnesses don’t do that and they are the most reliable women.” The man walked out, saying to himself: “Well, I cannot just rely on what these men say; after all, they do not believe in God at all and, who knows, maybe Jehovah’s witnesses even cooperate with the Communists, seeing that they attack the Catholic church so strongly.” This suspicion inspired him with an idea. Instead of returning home, he went to the Catholic clergyman; after all, this was a friend of his. There he opened his heart and told the clergyman that his wife was no longer a Catholic and even makes propaganda for the Witnesses. He said it with much volume and in an excited mood. The clergyman, an elderly person, calmed him and asked him to be seated. And then he said: “Leave your wife in peace and don’t bother her, because what she reads and what she is telling others is the truth and actually it is what we should do.” Upon hearing this the man was finished. He said to the clergyman: “That then means that you have not told us the truth thus far and yet you have the courage to tell this in my face? Why don’t you take this course? Why do you still stick to those lies we have been taught?” Upon this the clergyman asked him again to be calm and said: “For us, it is already too late; we are too deep in this swamp to get out again. But you and your wife, you can yet do it, and as a friend I am giving you this advice.” The man hurried home, hugged his wife and told her that henceforth he would study this message with her, because, after all, this must be the truth! Today this husband, at one time strongly opposed, not only studies the truth with his wife, but also attends our public meetings. This is a lesson of encouragement for all who live in a divided household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The activities of Jehovah’s witnesses during 1963 showed that they had great faith in Jehovah God. They were courageous and very busy. In many parts of the world they stood up marvelously under persecution. The message of God’s kingdom was heard in more lands than at any time before. They pressed their preaching and teaching work into 194 countries, provinces, colonies and islands of the sea, and because of this there are now more than one million Kingdom publishers proclaiming the good news worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s Christian witnesses appreciate the heavy responsibility that rests upon each person who comes out of Babylon seeking the truth. We must aid them in 1964 to get an accurate understanding of the Word of God and to grow on to maturity. This will take a lot more work on our part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Things are not going to get easier for us in the days ahead, but as God’s people we will have to display the same kind of boldness that Peter and John and the rest of the apostles displayed in their day. This, by Jehovah’s help, we will do. All of us who have dedicated our lives to Jehovah’s service are conscious of our spiritual needs and we want to be filled with the holy spirit so that we can be speaking the Word of God with boldness. We have enjoyed our finest year yet in preaching because we devoted 151,251,242 hours to the field ministry. The year’s report shows that we spent this time wisely and efficiently in telling out and teaching the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only have we, Jehovah’s witnesses, given freely of our time, but we have contributed of our own resources to help some of our brothers devote all their time to the field service. Due to the generous contributions on the part of God’s people around the world, 7,475 missionaries and special pioneers have been able to work in special assignments. The Society spent $2,808,000.00 to assist special pioneers this past year in all the countries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As slaves of Jehovah the world around we appreciate the fine work done in our behalf by the circuit and district servants. We now have 1,983 brothers serving regularly in these capacities, and the Society helped them in their travels during the past year to the extent of $495,000.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a joy it has been for the Society to be able to spend $3,303,000.00 to aid more than 9,500 persons to stay on in Jehovah’s service. You brothers have spent not only your time but your money too in order to get the good news of the Kingdom preached. Thank you so much for helping the Society carry out its responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one is dedicated to the service of God as a Christian witness of Jehovah he will continue to exercise justice and loving-kindness and will be modest in walking with his God, Jehovah. (Mic. 6:8) So with joy we will all do that and look forward to the new year of service wherein we will again be declaring the “everlasting good news” to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In closing this report I want to say that from all the lands in the earth where Jehovah’s witnesses live they have asked me to convey to all of you their warm love and greetings and to let you know also that they appreciate the good things you have done for them. Especially are they thankful for your prayers in their behalf continually. May it be our pleasure now to show boldness and courage as we move ahead together, doing the work we have been commanded to do. Our prayer is that Jehovah’s rich blessing will go with all of us as we keep on speaking to the people “all the sayings about this life,” knowing that we must obey God as ruler rather than men. Be assured of my warm love and best wishes too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, President</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The annual meeting of members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was held on Tuesday, October 1, 1963, pursuant to notice and in accordance with law and with the corporation’s charter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a half-hour program that preceded the annual business meeting. The Society’s president, N. H. Knorr, called the meeting to order and consideration was given to the text and comments for the day by L. A. Swingle, a director of the Society. He also offered prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were a number of members of the corporation present from foreign lands and the president of the Society called on them for brief reports, which were of great interest to those in attendance. The following brothers spoke: Jules G. Feller, Berne, Switzerland; Marvin F. Anderson, Oslo, Norway; Donald E. Baxter, Caracas, Venezuela; Erkki J. Kankaanpaa, Helsinki, Finland; Emil H. Van Daalen, Santurce, Puerto Rico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After enjoying their delightful reports the president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, opened the formal business meeting. Proof was then presented by the secretary and treasurer, Grant Suiter, that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania had a membership of 455 and that 443 members were present in person or by proxy. One feature of the order of business for the day was the election of directors to fill the vacancies occasioned by the expiration of the terms of Milton G. Henschel, Nathan FI. Knorr and Lyman A. Swingle, who had been elected October 1, 1960, for a term of three years. These same directors were unanimously reelected for a period of three years. After discussion of other matters the president of the Society called on the following members from foreign countries to give reports: James O. Webster, Barran-quilla, Colombia; Thomas R. Yeatts, Curacao, Netherlands Antilles; Richard E. Abrahamson, Copenhagen, Denmark; Harry W. Arnott, Kitwe, Northern Rhodesia; William A. Bivens, San Jose, Costa Rica; Charles Eisenhower, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Wilfred Gooch, Lagos, Nigeria; David D. Hibshman, Guatemala City, Guatemala; Joseph E. Babinski, Bangkok, Thailand; Walter E. Klinck, Monrovia, Liberia; Paul Kushnir, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Frederick J. Wilson, Santiago, Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s president, Nathan H. Knorr, then addressed the assembly, discussing the spirit of the world 289 in contrast with the worshipful spirit manifested by Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 1,656 persons in attendance, filling the two Kingdom Halls located in the building of the Society at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A closing prayer was offered by N. H. Knorr and the meeting was adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days later, October 3, the board of directors met at Brooklyn headquarters and all the erstwhile officers were nominated and reelected to succeed themselves, namely, for president, N. H. Knorr; for vicepresident, F. W. Franz; for secretary and treasurer, Grant Suiter; for assistant secretary and treasurer, H. H. Riemer. The other directors of the Society are: T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle and M. G. Henschel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEW YORK SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., was held on January 12, 1963, at its Brooklyn (New York) headquarters, after an adjournment from the originally scheduled date of January 5, 1963. For the information of all of Jehovah’s witnesses the directors and officers of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., are as follows: N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer; H. H. Riemer and J. O. Groh, as assistants secretary and treasurer; G. M. Couch, director, and M. H. Larson, director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the members of the boards of directors of these two societies are grateful for their privileges of service and will continue to work diligently and at unity in the overseers’ positions they have in Jehovah’s organization. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they will continue to praise Jehovah’s name by declaring the “everlasting good news” along with all of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts ^:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter and John were bold. It took boldness to speak publicly to a great crowd of Jews in Jerusalem and say: “Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one, and you asked for a man, a murderer, to be freely granted to you, whereas you killed the Chief Agent of life. But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses.” (Acts 3:14,15) Such talk by these apostles helped thousands of Jews to become Christians. However, the chief priests, the captain of the temple and the Sadducees were annoyed because Peter and John were teaching the people the truth and “plainly declaring the resurrection from the dead in the case of Jesus.” The Bible account shows that these religionists “laid their hands upon them and put them in custody till the next day.” By this time the number of men who became believers was about 5,000. —Acts 4:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next day the rulers, including Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and the kinsfolk of the chief priest, inquired of Peter and John: ‘By what power or in whose name did you heal this lame man?’ Can you imagine Peter and John standing there before that august body of rulers? Now hear them say: “Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you impaled but whom God raised up from the dead, by this one does this man stand here sound in front of you.” (Acts 4:10) Where had Peter and John learned such boldness of speech? Had they seen or heard the like of it before? Yes, they had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They saw the officers of the Jews seize Jesus, bind him and lead him to Annas. They heard the chief priest question Jesus about his disciples and about his teachings. And they heard Jesus answer him: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.” (John 18:19-21) Jesus was bold in his expression. He did not try to hide what he was doing. Peter and John </span><span class="font5">291</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">saw and heard Jesus speak boldly before the religious rulers because John later wrote about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Later Jesus was ushered off to Pilate, the governor. Pilate said to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Jesus answered: ‘Is it of your own originality that you say this, or did others tell you about me?’ Pilate answered: ‘I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you up to me. What did you do?’ Jesus answered: ‘My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.’ Therefore Pilate said to him: ‘Well, then, are you a king?’ Jesus answered: ‘You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone that is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.’ ” —John 18:33-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus did not hesitate to let the chief priests, religious rulers or the political ruler, Pilate, and others know who he was or what he was preaching. It was the truth. So he spoke the word of God boldly! Jesus was certainly filled with holy spirit when before these rulers. It was the same spirit that he promised would come upon the disciples. Peter and John had a good example here and so they walked in Jesus’ footsteps when they were before Annas and Caiaphas.—Acts 4:5-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter and John must have remembered Jesus’ words, too, when he said: “Why, you will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations. However, when they deliver you up, do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak; for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour; for the ones speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you.” (Matt. 10:18-20) They believed these words and prayed: “Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.” God answered their prayers quickly: “When they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.” —Acts 4:29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Showing this kind of boldness in those early days did not stop there. Later when Saul of Tarsus, named Paul, became a Christian he was given the holy spirit and he showed the same kind of boldness when brought before the ruler Festus. Paul said: “I am standing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also are finding out quite well.” (Acts 25:10) Later Paul had the opportunity to appear before King Agrippa, and after setting out matters very plainly to this ruler he said: “Do you, King Agrippa, believe the Prophets? I know you believe.” “But Agrippa said to Paul: ‘In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.’ At this Paul said: ‘I could wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I also am, with the exception of these bonds.’ ”—Acts 26:27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul, filled with holy spirit, spoke the word of God with boldness. That is the way Jehovah’s witnesses must speak today. Will you? We all have these same examples of faithful Christians standing before rulers, religious and political. They declared the truth from the Word of God without hesitation. This is no time for hesitation. Every one of us must study the Word of God carefully so that we, too, can be “filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness.” This was the answer to the prayer of the early Christians. Will we get the same answer to our sincere prayer? We can!—Acts 4:30,31.</span></p>

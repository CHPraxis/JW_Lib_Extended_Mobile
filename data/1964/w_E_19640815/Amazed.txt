Amazed
In the Solomon Islands difficulty arose between two villages, one of which is comprised of Jehovah’s witnesses and persons studying with Witnesses. Before learning God’s truth and being baptized, the headman in the village of Witnesses had the reputation of being a very hard man. When the day came to have the meeting to straighten things out, all the men in the other village came with their spears, bush knives and war clubs, just in case something might happen. How surprised they were when the Witnesses and their friends arrived, not carrying anything that even looked like a weapon! They sat down to work out a solution to their problem, peacefully. The non-Witness villagers were amazed.

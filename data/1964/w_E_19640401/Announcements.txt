FIELD MINISTRY
By speaking the truth of God’s Word, the Bible, Christians show themselves to be at unity, and at the same time they aid others to share the benefits of such unity. During April Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do this by offering to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower for $1, with three Bible-study booklets free for new subscribers.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A Witness living in Iowa tells what happened one day when two little boys, aged ten and seven, excitedly came to her door and inquired as to the time of meetings held by Jehovah’s witnesses: “They said they had been wanting to come for a long time, and now their mother was finally going to let them. Their parents had forced them to go to different churches, but since they had learned about God’s new order of things from their grandmother several years ago, they were very dissatisfied. They came to their first meeting that very night.”</p>

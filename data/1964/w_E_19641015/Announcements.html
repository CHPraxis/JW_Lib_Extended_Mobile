<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God has provided everlasting good news that is today being proclaimed to all peoples, and it is the privilege of his servants on the earth to share in this proclamation. During October, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do this by giving brief Bible sermons to the people in their homes, by conducting free home Bible studies with those who manifest interest, and by offering the <em>Awake! </em>magazine on a subscription basis; $1 for a year.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Libraries contain the recorded wisdom of contemporary writers mostly, although unusually wise men of past generations are represented also. But do you realize that many homes contain a complete library of sixty-six books, none of which are much less than two thousand years old? Yet this collection of rare old books is generally recognized as the greatest source of wisdom to be found. It is the Holy Bible. Do you consult this “library” often? How well acquainted are you with its excellent advantages? Read <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </em>It is not a book of interpretation. But its intensive examination of each of the Bible’s sixty-six books will make the Bible a new book for you. Send only $1.</p>

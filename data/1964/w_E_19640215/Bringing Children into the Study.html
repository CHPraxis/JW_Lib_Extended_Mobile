<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman who is a dedicated Christian in Indiana tells what led up to a Bible study she is now conducting with two women who are sisters in the flesh: “About fifteen years ago a Witness conducted a Bible study with a mother and her two young girls. The study was held for a year and a half and then it was stopped. This lady’s husband had died, forcing her to seek work to care for her family. The added time-consuming responsibility caused her desire to take in knowledge of God’s Word to fade. The study was not resumed; however, the seeds of truth that had been planted were ingrained so that the mother did not send her daughters back to places of false religion. Occasionally the girls would go to church with girl friends out of respect for friendship, but they would feel disgust at the sermon. After marriage they never attended church with their husbands. On many occasions these two sisters talked between themselves of the truth; finally, they reached a decision to have a Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Even after fifteen years they remembered the name of the lady that had studied with their mother and they proceeded to call her. The call was turned over to me, a study was started and they now do incidental witnessing at every opportunity, also encouraging their mother to resume her Bible study and find the peace and joy that they have.”</p>

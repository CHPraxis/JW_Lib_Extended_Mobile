FIELD MINISTRY
What must one do to put up a fine fight for the faith? He must publish that faith before “many witnesses.” (1 Tim. 6:12) Jehovah’s witnesses will be doing that during January by preaching and teaching from the Bible, and by offering to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, together with three booklets on the Bible, for a contribution of $1.
DAY-BY-DAY REFRESHMENT
Never has a year produced such widespread activity in the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses as the year just past. You will enjoy the 1964 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses as you consider the heartwarming experiences it contains. Each day of the new year you will find inspiring and instructive reading, not only in this fascinating report, but in the daily consideration of the scriptures and comments taken from issues of The Watchtower of the past year. Send for your copy; it is only 50c. Send also for the 1964 calendar, which displays the year’s Bible text, beautifully illustrated. It is 25c.

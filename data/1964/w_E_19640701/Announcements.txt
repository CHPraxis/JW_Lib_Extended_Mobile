FIELD MINISTRY
All of Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate association with fellow Christians as they share in Jehovah’s service. It is strengthening and brings mutual encouragement. Besides that, their ministry is a source of encouragement to others who long for a knowledge of God’s Word. To aid such persons, during July Jehovah’s witnesses will offer the 704-page book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, along with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of 75c.
FLEE NOW!
“Get out of her, my people!” This admonition is one of the strongest warnings of the Bible. It is recorded in the book of Revelation and is directed to everyone who professes belief in God. But, get out of what? And, flee where? And why? The answer to the last question is, Because your life depends upon it! The answers to the other two questions, and many more, are to be found in the 704-page book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! Send for your copy and see what the prophecies concerning Babylon the Great mean to this generation. Send only 75c. For writing at once you will receive free the booklet God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?

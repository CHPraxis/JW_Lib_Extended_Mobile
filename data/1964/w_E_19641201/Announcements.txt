FIELD MINISTRY
Keeping filled with the spirit of God requires that we continually avail ourselves of the means that God has provided by which we can receive his spirit. Throughout December Jehovah’s witnesses will seek to aid persons everywhere to do this by offering them the modern-language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” on a contribution of $2.
ARE YOU DISCOURAGED AT TIMES?
Many sincere persons who seriously consider present world conditions become discouraged at the prospects of any relief. Yet they continue to pray to God: “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Are you one of such persons? Are you discouraged or are you truly “living in hope of a righteous new world”? Read the Bible regularly. Find the hope and encouragement it contains. A modern-language version, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, can be yours for a contribution of just $1. Send today and receive free the faith-inspiring booklet Living in Hope of a Righteous New World.

(a) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="40-1" class="b">John 5:29</a>, does the word “judgment” allow for two possibilities for the ones judged?

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In Jesus’ expression “resurrection of judgment,” does the word “judgment” mean an opportunity to have the court judge decide in favor of the person on trial? No! “Judgment” here does not mean a judicial trial with two possibilities, either that of the judge’s pronouncing a person not guilty and releasing him or that of the judge’s condemning him and adjudging him to punishment.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> “Judgment” means the act of judging, the intellectual or mental process of forming an opinion by considering the facts of the case, the judicial decision of a case in court.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> It must be either favorable or unfavorable.

Concerning persons who now make a practice of doing vile things, Jesus said: “He that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved. But he that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:20-43:3:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 3:20, 21</a>) In a warning to us against jealousy and contentiousness <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:14-59:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 3:14-16</a> goes on to say: “This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is the earthly, animal, demonic.

Jehovah came with his holy myriads, to execute <em>judgment </em>[<em>krisis</em>] against all, and to convict all the ungodly.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:7-44:7:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 7:7</a> says concerning Egypt: “‘That nation for which they [the Israelites] will slave I shall judge,’ God said, ‘and after these things they will come out and will render sacred service to me in this place.’”</p>

It does not mean such!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>CONTRASTS, OPPOSITES</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9, 10. (a) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="45-1" class="b">John 5:29</a>, what is Jesus making between the things there mentioned? (b) What does he contrast in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:17-43:3:19" data-bid="46-1" class="b">John 3:17-19</a>?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Keep in mind also that, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 5:29</a>, Jesus Christ is making contrasts. He is contrasting “those who did good things” and “those who practiced vile things.” Correspondingly, he contrasts the “resurrection of life” and the “resurrection of judgment.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In other places Jesus makes the same contrast between salvation (or life) and judgment. For example, after telling of God’s great love for the world of mankind Jesus said: “God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him. He that exercises faith in him is not to be judged. He that does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. Now this is the basis <span id="page729" class="pageNum" data-no="729" data-before-text="729"></span>for judgment [or, this is the <em>krisis</em>], that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:17-43:3:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 3:17-19</a>) In those verses all the cases of judging and of judgment are in a condemnatory sense. All are contrasted with salvation to everlasting life.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:47-43:12:47" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 12:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Matthew 25:46</a>.</p>

(b) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="48-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>, what two opposite outcomes does Jesus show for those coming out of the memorial tombs?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:24-43:5:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 5:24</a>, just a few verses ahead of where Jesus mentions the resurrection of the dead, he makes the same contrast between life and judgment, saying: “He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.” Hence in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a> Jesus shows the two distinct and opposite outcomes of the general resurrection or coming out of the memorial tombs.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>They are (1) “life” and (2) “judgment,” that is, a condemnatory judgment, a condemnation, a “damnation” in the now out-of-date language of the King James Version Bible; an adjudging to punishment by the utter loss of all life anywhere.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13. (a) A real contrast between “life” and “judgment” will not allow for what interpretation of the word “judgment”? (b) So then, what kind of thing does the word “judgment” here mean?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jesus does not contrast (1) “life” and (2) a “judgment” the outcome of which is uncertain, either life if the resurrected one turns from practicing vile things or death if he does not turn from such practice. This would be no real contrast, for eternal life would then be possible by the “resurrection of judgment” as well as by the “resurrection of life.” And since Jesus said that “all” would come out and that all would come out to a “resurrection,” to a “resurrection” either of life or of judgment, it would then reduce itself to a universal salvation of “all those in the memorial tombs” who hear Jesus’ voice and come out. To the contrary of this, “judgment” here means, not a divisible judgment, but a single judgment with but one sentence that adjudges the practicers of vile things to a loss of all life.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">14. (a) Since the word “judgment” is used only in connection with “those who practiced vile things,” does this mean that the gainers of life do not pass through a testing? (b) Since the 144,000 gain an instantaneous perfection in heaven, when do they have their judgment period?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Accordingly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a> indicates two general classes that are distinguished from each other by the outcome of their course of action after they are resurrected. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 5:29</a> Jesus uses the Greek word <em>krisis </em>only in connection with those who do vile things, but this does not mean that those who gain the “resurrection of life” do not pass through a trial or testing before they actually enter into their life eternal.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> In the case of the 144,000 who become associate judges with Jesus Christ in heaven, they have an instantaneous entrance into perfect immortal spirit life with Christ. But they have been on trial here on earth, for, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:17-60:4:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:17</a> says, “it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. Now if it starts first with us, what will the end be of those who are not obedient to the good news of God?” Consequently, when they die faithful in the flesh, the end of their judgment period comes. In God’s due time they take part in the “first resurrection” and then “the second death has no authority” over them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4-6</a>) They then become judges instead of being put on judgment.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. When do those who experience the “resurrection of judgment” have the judgment executed upon them?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>However, when do those who come out of the memorial tombs to a “resurrection of judgment” on earth have the judgment <span id="page730" class="pageNum" data-no="730" data-before-text="730"></span>pronounced and executed on them? Not immediately after they take their stand before the “great white throne and the one seated on it,” but only after they “practiced vile things” either during Christ’s thousand-year reign or at the end of the thousand years when Satan and his demons are released from the abyss to tempt restored mankind.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. Having their names “written in the book of life” depends upon what, and when may the “second death” be applied, and why then?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:11-66:20:15" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 20:11-15</a> pictures how all those on earth who are given up by the sea and Hades and death have an opportunity to get their names “written in the book of life.” Whether they will be judged worthy of that will depend on how they lived up to the “scrolls” of instruction that will then be opened up and according to which they will be judged. Some of these may be found unworthy before the thousand years are ended. So they may then and there be executed with the “second death,” because in a vile way they have refused to live up to the Kingdom requirements and to progress toward human perfection and holiness.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17. When will others be executed, and why then?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Others will be executed after the thousand years are over. By then they will have attained to human perfection and to ability to live sinlessly in harmony with all the laws of God and in support of his universal sovereignty. But when Satan and his demons are loosed to test them, they will vilely turn from righteousness and side in with Satan the Devil, the great rebel against the universal sovereignty of the Most High God. For committing such vileness they will fail under the final test and prove unworthy of eternal life. They will then be “those who practiced vile things.”</p>

Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.” For such people the resurrection that they enjoyed when they came out of the tombs turns out to be a “resurrection of judgment,” to annihilation; because when the time finally came for the judicial award of life or condemnation to be made, their record showed them to be “those who practiced vile things.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Men of faith turn to God for guidance. Regularly they talk to God in prayer, and they walk with God by ordering their lives in harmony with his Word. During August, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to help others to appreciate the wisdom of walking and talking with God by presenting to them the 704-page Bible-study aid <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>along with a booklet, on a contribution of 75c.</p>

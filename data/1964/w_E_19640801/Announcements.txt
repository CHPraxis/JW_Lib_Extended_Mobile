FIELD MINISTRY
Men of faith turn to God for guidance. Regularly they talk to God in prayer, and they walk with God by ordering their lives in harmony with his Word. During August, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to help others to appreciate the wisdom of walking and talking with God by presenting to them the 704-page Bible-study aid “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, along with a booklet, on a contribution of 75c.
A BOOK OF BIBLE REFERENCES
Have you ever wished you could collect together the most pointed Bible texts on some particular subject? Well, “Make Sure of All Things” does just that on seventy selected main topics or themes and hundreds of different subtopics. This is not a Bible commentary. It is a compilation of direct quotations from the Bible on vital topics. It will provide you with many hours of enjoyable and profitable reading and serve continuously as a handy reference work. Send for your copy today. Sent postpaid for only 75c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Reflecting the fact that the Roman Catholic Church is declining in influence in South America, rather than converting all the world of mankind to Christ, the New York <em>Times </em>of February 28, 1964, carried this news item from Rome: “Pope Paul VI has appealed for more priests for Latin America where the Roman Catholic Church is ‘experiencing a decisive hour in its existence.’” Continuing with his remarks, the pope spoke of “the needs, the dangers” with which the church is confronted in South America and said that these are things with which the bishops whom he was addressing were well acquainted.</p>

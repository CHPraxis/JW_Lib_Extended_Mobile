<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A <em>Handbook of Christian Theology </em>observes concerning early Christians: “In the little company of Jesus and his friends there was no division into clergy and laity . . . the disciples, who might look from here like laymen, were really the preachers . . . There were leaders and teachers and special spokesmen, of course. But they did no more than show or set the direction of every Christian’s obligation.”</p>

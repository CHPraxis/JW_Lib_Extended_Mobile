FIELD MINISTRY
By speaking the truth of God’s Word, the Bible, Christians show themselves to be at unity, and at the same time they aid others to share the benefits of such unity. During April Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do this by offering to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower for $1, with three Bible-study booklets free for new subscribers.
STILL MORE TO COME!
Which article in this issue of The Watchtower did you enjoy the most? Is it hard to decide? Most persons find it so. But there is no real need to select one over another, because all are designed to serve a useful purpose. Besides, the next issue will give you more of the same enjoyment. So, be good to yourself! Send for a year’s subscription. It is only $1. Do it now and we will send you free three timely booklets on equally enjoyable and beneficial Bible subjects. Send today.

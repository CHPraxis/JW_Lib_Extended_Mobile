<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Did the serpent lose legs or feet as means of movement as a result of the divine curse recorded at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:14-1:3:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:14</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:14-1:3:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:14</a> we are told: “And Jehovah God proceeded to say to the serpent: ‘Because you have done this thing, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild beasts of the field. Upon your belly you will go and dust is what you will eat all the days of your life.’” This is the only place in the Bible where any indication is given that the serpent did not at one time travel on its belly.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What is said here is, of course, directed principally to the invisible spirit creature who used the literal serpent as his mouthpiece. It foretells his debasement. But for the symbolic application of this judgment upon the wicked spirit creature who became Satan to have any force there must be a fulfillment of it in the literal serpent, which has come to symbolize Satan. It, therefore, is reasonable to conclude that before God cursed it the serpent possessed legs that elevated it above the ground. As he had the power to create the serpent in the first place, God had the power to transform its body so that it ceased to have legs and was able to move about on its belly.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN ISRAEL a Jewish person became interested in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, resulting in the following experience: “One day someone knocked at my door. A man entered from the rabbinate and told me that the rabbinate had heard that I had changed my religion. The committee of the rabbinate met to discuss the matter, and said that they are ready to help me out financially if I would return to the Jewish religion, for they thought that I had been converted to another religion because of financial reasons. I answered him saying that there are some things that cannot be bought nor sold with money, and truth of God’s Word, the Bible, was one of them. This truth I have found with the aid of Jehovah’s witnesses. The representative from the rabbinate then asked, ‘Who is Jehovah?’ I answered, ‘It is a shame for a Jew not to know the name Jehovah!’ I took a Bible and showed him scriptures and evidence, and asked him if he agreed to all the evidence. He began to mumble, obviously embarrassed, ‘It has been a long time since I have held a Bible in my hand, so that I cannot answer from it.’ Then I said to him, ‘If you do not know the name of God and you do not know his written Word, the Bible, why and to whom do you pray in the synagogue?’ The man did not know what to answer. He said, ‘Shall I tell you a secret? I don’t believe in anything. I just continue the tradition of my ancestors. The main thing is that I have a certain job at the rabbinate for which I receive a salary.’ After witnessing to him, I gave him some Bible literature, and told him to thank the rabbis for their offer of financial aid, but I did not need it, as I put my trust in the living God, Jehovah.”</p>

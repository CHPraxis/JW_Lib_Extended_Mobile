<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>RENEW YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many leading clergymen today deny that the Bible is a book of historical facts. They hold that such accounts as the creation of man are myths and fables. As a result, the confidence of those who know little about the Bible is shaken. Do not fall into this snare. Read the Bible yourself. Send for the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>and read it daily. This modern-language version of the complete Bible in English is only $1. Also available, a gold-edged deluxe edition for $2.50. The <em>New World Translation </em>is also available for the Christian Greek Scriptures in Dutch, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese for only 50 cents a copy. Send now and receive free the booklet <em>When God Is King over All the Earth.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">During June Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share unitedly in the ministry, so cooperating together to maintain their spiritual maturity. As they do so they will be aiding others to acquire the Scriptural knowledge they need in order to serve God. This they will do by offering the modern-English <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>with a free Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of $1. To those who read Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish, they will offer the <em>New World Translation </em>of the Christian Greek Scriptures for just 50c.</p>

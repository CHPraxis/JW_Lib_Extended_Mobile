<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ In Florida one of Jehovah’s witnesses had the following experience: “A nine-year-old girl living on my street came to my home one evening. She said she had heard that I was a Bible instructor and asked if I would be willing to study the Bible with her, because, after attending Sunday school for three years, they were still reading stories about pictures they colored. I gave her the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </em>and the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>for her parents to look over. The next evening I called on the parents, explained our work and method of study. They gave their daughter permission to study during summer vacation but said she would have to go back to Sunday school when school started. During our studies sincere appreciation and much enthusiasm were shown.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The first time she was back in Sunday school she told her classmates about Paradise and the Kingdom for which Christians are to pray. The teacher was amazed and asked her where she got her information. ‘From the Bible,’ she answered, ‘and a nice lady helped me to understand it.’ Every Sunday she came home from Sunday school crying because she did not learn anything about God’s kingdom or about God’s name. Finally she thought of an idea. She looked up scriptures and bombarded her parents with questions that they could not answer, with the result that we resumed our study in the <em>Paradise </em>book and she no longer goes to Sunday school. Also, she brought over her seven-year-old neighbor boy to get him started in studying the Bible.”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
It is the privilege and responsibility of those who have already been liberated from Babylon the Great to help others who are unwilling captives of that wicked empire of oppression to “get out of her.” That you can do during November by sharing in the distribution of the revealing book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! It will be placed, along with a Bible-study booklet, for 75c.
1965 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
As evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses during the past service year were truly “filled with the holy spirit” and were “speaking the word of God with boldness,” the new 1965 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses presents a report of preaching activity that surpasses anything done to date. The thrilling experiences recorded of those who have overcome difficulties and hardships to preach the “everlasting good news” will deepen your own faith and incite you to greater works. Obtain your copy. Send 50c. Write for the 1965 calendar also. It is 25c. Both are available after November 23.

“Jehovah of Armies”
◆ Have you observed that expression in your Bible? What does it mean to you? It is not unfamiliar to Bible readers, because it appears in the Hebrew text 281 times. It should remind you that Jehovah is not only the Creator of the visible army of heavenly bodies, but the Commander in Chief of invisible, angelic hosts or armies that he can use against his enemies to accomplish his irresistible purpose. The expression is one that should strengthen God’s people when they are harassed by apparently overwhelming numbers of those who oppose them. It should remind us that we do not have to stand in our own strength, that we are not alone.—Isa. 47:4.

The Truth Purifies
● A woman in Olinda, Brazil, who had been reared a Catholic turned to spiritism when she married. She smoked and gambled. Once, when tipped off by the demons, she won. Then she attended the Baptist and other Protestant churches, but did not join them because she thought that salvation by the mere raising of the hand was too easy. One day she was visited by Jehovah’s witnesses. She began to study the Bible with them and to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall but continued to smoke and to gamble. On one occasion, her daughter said to her: “Mother, why don’t you give up that religion? You do not stop smoking and gambling; you are only fooling yourself.” She came to her senses and, praying earnestly for Jehovah’s help, she decided never to smoke or gamble again. So she made her dedication to Jehovah and is now an active publisher of the good news of the Kingdom.

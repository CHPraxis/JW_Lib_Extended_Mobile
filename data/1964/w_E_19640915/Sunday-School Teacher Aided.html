<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ONE of Jehovah’s witnesses attending an assembly in Kansas placed the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines with a woman who was a Sunday-school teacher. The woman used the coupons on the back of the magazines to subscribe for both, realizing they would help her with her teaching work. As the magazines started to come, she noticed the coupon about the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>She wrote the Society, asking for ten of the new Bibles for her class. When she received the Bibles, she thought the minister might not let her use them if he knew who the publishers were, so she tore out the pages with the publisher’s identity. Her interest mounted as each magazine came to her home.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Almost a year later, she was again contacted by a Witness, who was invited in. “I’ve been expecting someone from your organization to call on me,” she told the Witness bubbling over with enthusiasm from the things she had learned. Immediately a Bible study was started in the book <em>“Let God Be True.” </em>The interested woman started attending meetings and sharing in the house-to-house ministry. When she gave up her church affiliation, her Sunday-school replacement inquired as to where she had gotten the green Bibles, as she wanted to obtain more, since they were so easy to understand. As a result, this new publisher took the opportunity to give a witness, and the Sunday-school replacement became interested and began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.</p>

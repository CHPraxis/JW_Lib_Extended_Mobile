<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible, the book of “everlasting good news,” is indeed beneficial to all and for all things, and it is deserving of sincere consideration. It points the way to life everlasting and exposes those who hinder others in seeking to attain it. As an aid to life seekers, during September Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to present the 704-page Bible-study aid <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>with a booklet, for 75c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s spirit would not produce the works of this world that are seen on every hand. God’s spirit produces love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. What protection do you have against the spirit of this world? How can you avail yourself of the fruitage of God’s spirit? These matters were the focal point of talks this summer at the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The principal assembly discourses will soon be featured in <em>The Watchtower. </em>Subscribe now for one year. Send only $1. Allow God’s spirit to motivate your life.</p>

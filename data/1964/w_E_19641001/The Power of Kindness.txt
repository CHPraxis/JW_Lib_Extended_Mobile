The Power of Kindness
◆ Christian kindness can attract people of a good heart to Jehovah’s truth. This is the way it happened in the case of one individual in Canada: “One Saturday afternoon during the circuit servant’s visit my husband and I were making our last call in the field ministry for that day. The lady who lived next door was just locking up her house to go away. We asked her if she would like a ride as we were going on to Andover, and it turned out that this lady was going to Andover to visit some friends. When we arrived there we found that her friends were just leaving to go across the border to a funeral and would not be back that night. As a result this lady was stranded. So we invited her to go to the meeting with us and after the meeting we would take her home. She accepted our invitation to the meeting and enjoyed it so much that she went with us to the public talk the circuit servant gave in Bristol the following week. She enjoyed this so much that she went with us to the public talk the next week and has expressed a desire to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”

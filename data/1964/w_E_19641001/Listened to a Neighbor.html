<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Curitiba, Brazil, was witnessing from house to house when she was interrupted just as she was about to read a Bible text, the householder saying: “Would you please be so kind as to go away and convert the pagan Catholics, because I was converted twenty years ago and don’t need your advice.” The Witness kindly tried to explain the reason for her visit, but she was not given an opportunity. The reception she received at the next house was different. The householder was pleasantly surprised by the explanations given and took the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </em>On the following Sunday, when the Witness returned to give her further explanations as she had promised, the lady said: “You know, I showed this book to my neighbor and she was thrilled with it, so she asked me to tell you that she would like one of these books.” The Witness went to her. She took the book and said: “I, who thought that I knew everything, don’t know anything. But Jehovah will help me to learn what I did not learn during the twenty years I was a Baptist.”</p>

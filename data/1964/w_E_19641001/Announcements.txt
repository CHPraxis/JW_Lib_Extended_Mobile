FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God has provided everlasting good news that is today being proclaimed to all peoples, and it is the privilege of his servants on the earth to share in this proclamation. During October, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do this by giving brief Bible sermons to the people in their homes, by conducting free home Bible studies with those who manifest interest, and by offering the Awake! magazine on a subscription basis; $1 for a year.
NOTICE TO READERS!
Did you know that this magazine you hold in your hand has a companion? It is Awake! Like The Watchtower it is spiritually awake because it is governed by true Bible principles, not philosophy or expediency. But it does not deal exclusively with Bible doctrine. It is a magazine of facts, news, everyday problems, practical sciences, human interests and the wonders of God’s creation. It is instructive, wholesome reading for all, but not from a materialistic standpoint. Send for a year’s subscription and receive three booklets on timely Bible subjects free. One year, $1.

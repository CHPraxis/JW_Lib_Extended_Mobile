“Unyielding Courage”
Speaking of Jehovah’s witnesses, the book God Is a Millionaire by Richard Mathison makes this observation: “During the Korean War, the products of easy Protestantism, of our military schools and our better colleges cracked by the score. . . . A Pentagon study of the problem brought forth a red-faced conclusion: Those few Jehovah’s Witnesses who ended up as prisoners of war, . . . withstood to a man the scientific, psychological efforts to convert them to Communism—better than a number of patriotic West Pointers.”

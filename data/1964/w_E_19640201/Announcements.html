<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses not only understand and accept the Biblical teaching of the general priesthood, but they apply the principle, putting it into practice as they all share in preaching God’s Word to others. During February they will do this by offering a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine on a contribution of $1. Three Bible-study booklets will be given to each new subscriber.</p>

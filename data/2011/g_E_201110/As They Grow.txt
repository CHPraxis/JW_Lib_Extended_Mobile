As They Grow
“We both enjoyed My Book of Bible Stories when we were children. Now we have a 16-month-old son, Joshua. The book is a wonderful teaching tool for him. Even at his tender age, Joshua can identify by name at least 35 Bible characters in the book. They have become a part of his vocabulary.”—Timothy and Ann.
“My young son loves looking through the book Learn From the Great Teacher, and he already knows most of the pictures. It has helped me to reason with him about overcoming problems at school and elsewhere. It is more than I could have asked for!”—Jennifer.
“Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work, Volume 2, deals with every aspect of a young person’s life. I am 19 years old. This book has helped me to make goals, to make wise decisions regarding dating, and to progress in my relationship with God. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old.”—Courtney.

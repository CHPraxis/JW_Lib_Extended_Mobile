<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“We both enjoyed <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>when we were children. Now we have a 16-month-old son, Joshua. The book is a wonderful teaching tool for him. Even at his tender age, Joshua can identify by name at least 35 Bible characters in the book. They have become a part of his vocabulary.”<wbr />—Timothy and Ann.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My young son loves looking through the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher, </em>and he already knows most of the pictures. It has helped me to reason with him about overcoming problems at school and elsewhere. It is more than I could have asked for!”<wbr />—Jennifer.</p>

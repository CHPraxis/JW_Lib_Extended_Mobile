<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sm"> <strong>1. Is there only one true religion?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus taught his followers only one religion, the true religion. It is like a road leading to life. Regarding that road, Jesus said: “Few are the ones finding it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:14-40:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:14</a>) God accepts only worship based on his Word of truth. All true worshippers are united in one faith.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>John 4:23, 24;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <em>14:6;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:4-49:4:5" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> <em>Ephesians 4:4, 5</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sm"> <strong>2. Why do so many different religions claim to be Christian?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">False prophets have corrupted Christianity and have used it to further their own interests. As Jesus foretold, they present themselves as his “sheep” but act like hungry wolves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:13-40:7:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:21-40:7:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:23-40:7:23" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 23</a>) False Christianity developed especially after Jesus’ apostles died.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Acts 20:29, 30</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sm"> <strong>3. What are some features that distinguish true worship?</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>True worshippers respect the Bible as God’s Word. </em>They strive to live by its principles. So true religion differs from religion based on men’s ideas. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 15:7-9</a>) True worshippers do not preach one thing and practice another.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><em>John 17:17;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <em>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>The true religion honors God’s name, Jehovah. </em>Jesus made God’s name known. He helped people to know God and taught them to pray that God’s name be sanctified. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Where you live, which religion promotes the use of God’s name?<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>John 17:26;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:13-45:10:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <em>Romans 10:13, 14</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sm"><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span> <strong>4. How can you recognize true worshippers?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>True Christians preach about God’s Kingdom. </em>God sent Jesus to preach about the Kingdom. God’s Kingdom is the only hope for mankind. Jesus continued speaking about it until his dying day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 4:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:42-42:23:43" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 23:42, 43</a>) He told his followers to preach about God’s Kingdom. If someone approaches you to speak about God’s Kingdom, to which religion does he likely belong?<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 10:7;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> <em>24:14</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Jesus’ followers are no part of this wicked world. </em>They take no part in political affairs or social conflicts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Also, they do not imitate the world’s harmful practices and attitudes.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><em>James 1:27;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <em>4:4</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sm"> <strong>5. What is the primary mark of true Christianity?</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><em>True Christians have outstanding love for one another. </em>From God’s Word, they learn to respect members of all ethnic groups. Although false religion has often strongly supported the wars of the nations, true worshippers refuse to do so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:4:1-33:4:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Micah 4:1-4</a>) Rather, members of the true religion unselfishly use their time and resources to help and encourage others.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><em>John 13:34, 35;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:20-62:4:21" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <em>1 John 4:20, 21</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Which group bases all its teachings on God’s Word, honors God’s name, and proclaims God’s Kingdom as mankind’s only hope? Which group practices love and does not support war? The facts point to Jehovah’s Witnesses.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 3:10-12</a>.</p>

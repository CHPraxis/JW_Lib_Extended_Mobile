What Blessings Await Those Who Listen to God?



Most of the dead will be resurrected on earth. Acts 24:15






Imagine the future blessings that you will enjoy if you listen to Jehovah! You will have perfect health; no one will be sick or infirm. There will be no bad people, and you will be able to trust everyone.
There will be no pain, sorrow, or tears. No one will grow old and die.
You will be surrounded by friends and family. Life in Paradise will be a delight.
There will be no fear. People will be truly happy.



God’s Kingdom will end all suffering. Revelation 21:3, 4

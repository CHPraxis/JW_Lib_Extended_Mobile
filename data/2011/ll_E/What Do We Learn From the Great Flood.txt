PART 6
What Do We Learn From the Great Flood?



God destroyed the wicked but saved Noah and his family. Genesis 7:11, 12, 23






It rained for 40 days and 40 nights, and the water covered all the earth. All the wicked people died.
The rebellious angels left their bodies of flesh and became demons.





Those who were in the ark survived. Though Noah and his family eventually died, God will bring them to life again with the prospect of living forever.



God will again destroy the wicked and save the good people. Matthew 24:37-39






Satan and the demons continue to mislead people.
Today, as in Noah’s time, many reject Jehovah’s loving direction. Soon Jehovah will destroy all who are wicked.​—2 Peter 2:5, 6.





Some people are like Noah. They listen to God and do what he says; they are Jehovah’s Witnesses.



Choose the road that leads to life.​—Matthew 7:13, 14.

The wicked will be destroyed; the meek will enjoy peace.​—Psalm 37:10, 11.

PART 5
The Great Flood​—Who Listened? Who Did Not?



Most in Noah’s time did what was bad. Genesis 6:5






Adam and Eve had children, and people became many on the earth. In time, some angels joined Satan’s rebellion.
They came to earth and took on the bodies of men so that they could marry women. The women gave birth to superhuman sons, who were fierce and strong.





The world became filled with people who did bad things. The Bible says that “man’s wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.”



Noah listened to God and built an ark. Genesis 6:13, 14, 18, 19, 22






Noah was a good man. Jehovah told Noah that He was going to destroy the wicked people with a great flood.





God also told Noah to build a huge boat, called an ark, and to take into it his family and every sort of animal.





Noah warned people about the coming Flood, but they did not listen. Some laughed at Noah; others hated him.





When the ark was finished, Noah brought the animals inside.

Introduction



God is like a loving father. 1 Peter 5:6, 7






God is our Creator, and he cares for us. Just as a wise and loving father instructs his children, so God teaches people everywhere the best way to live.
God reveals precious truths that fill us with joy and hope.
If you listen to God, he will guide and protect you and help you deal with problems.
But there is more​—you will live forever!



“Come to me,” God tells us. “Listen, and . . . keep alive.” Isaiah 55:3

How Can You Have a Happy Family Life?



Love is the key to happy families. Ephesians 5:33






God’s standard is that marriage should be between one man and one woman.





A loving husband treats his wife with tenderness and understanding.
A wife should cooperate with her husband.





Children should obey their parents.



Be kind and faithful, not cruel and unfaithful. Colossians 3:5, 8-10






God’s Word says that a husband should love his wife as his own body and that a wife should have deep respect for her husband.





Sex outside the marriage arrangement is wrong. Polygamy is also wrong.





Jehovah’s Word teaches families how to be happy.



Keep morally clean.​—1 Corinthians 6:18.

Love, teach, and protect your children.​—Deuteronomy 6:4-9.

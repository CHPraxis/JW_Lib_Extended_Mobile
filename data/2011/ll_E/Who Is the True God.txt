PART 2
Who Is the True God?









There is only one true God, and his name is Jehovah. (Psalm 83:18) He is a Spirit; we cannot see him. He loves us and wants us to love him in return. He also wants us to love other people. (Matthew 22:35-40) He is the Supreme One, the Creator of all things.
The first of God’s creations was a mighty spirit person who later came to be known as Jesus Christ. Jehovah also created the angels.

PART 9
When Will Paradise Come?



Troubles on the earth prove that God’s Kingdom will soon act. Luke 21:10, 11; 2 Timothy 3:1-5






The Bible foretold many of the things that are happening today. It said that people would be lovers of money, disobedient to parents, fierce, and lovers of pleasures.
There would be great earthquakes, wars, food shortages, and widespread disease. These things are happening now.





Also, Jesus said that the good news about the Kingdom would be preached in all the earth.​—Matthew 24:14.



The Kingdom will remove all wickedness. 2 Peter 3:13






Jehovah will soon destroy all the wicked.
Satan and the demons will be punished.





Those who listen to God will survive into a righteous new world, where there will be no more fear, a world where people trust and love one another.



What did Jesus say would occur in our time?​—Matthew 24:3-14.

The wicked will be destroyed.​—2 Peter 3:7.

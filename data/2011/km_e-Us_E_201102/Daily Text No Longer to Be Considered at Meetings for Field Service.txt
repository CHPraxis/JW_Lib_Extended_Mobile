Daily Text No Longer to Be Considered at Meetings for Field Service
In the past, meetings for field service might have included a brief discussion of the daily text if it related to the ministry. This is being adjusted. Examining the Scriptures Daily should no longer be used as a basis for discussion during meetings for service. As before, conductors may make use of the Bible, Our Kingdom Ministry, the Ministry School book, the Reasoning book, and other material related to the ministry. Those assigned to conduct should prepare to share something practical to help those going in the ministry that day. As in the past, the length of the meeting should be no more than 10 to 15 minutes and should be shorter if it follows a congregation meeting.

Many places will experience good weather and longer hours of daylight. Some publishers will have vacation from work or school that they can use for the ministry. Beginning on April 2, we will enjoy a special campaign to invite interested ones to attend the Memorial with us on April 17. Thereafter, we will endeavor to develop the interest of those who attended and invite them to the special talk that will be given during the week of April 25. Indeed, there are many reasons to consider increasing our activity during March, April, and May.</p>

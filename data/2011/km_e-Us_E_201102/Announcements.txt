Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? Publishers may also offer The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ The special public talk for the 2011 Memorial season will be entitled “Bible Principles—Can They Help Us to Cope With Today’s Problems?”
▪ No meetings other than those for field service are to be held on Sunday, April 17, the day of the Memorial. Congregations that normally have a congregation meeting that day may move it to another day of the week. Where several congregations share the Kingdom Hall and a meeting cannot be rescheduled, the meeting may be canceled. In such cases, families are encouraged to consider the Watchtower Study material during their Family Worship evening.

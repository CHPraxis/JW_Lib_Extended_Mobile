<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ No meetings other than those for field service are to be held on Sunday, April 17, the day of the Memorial. Congregations that normally have a congregation meeting that day may move it to another day of the week. Where several congregations share the Kingdom Hall and a meeting cannot be rescheduled, the meeting may be canceled. In such cases, families are encouraged to consider the <em>Watchtower </em>Study material during their Family Worship evening.</p>

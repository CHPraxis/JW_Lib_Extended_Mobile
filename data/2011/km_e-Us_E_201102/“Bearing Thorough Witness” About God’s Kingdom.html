<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>During the week of March 14, 2011, we will begin consideration of <em>“Bearing Thorough Witness” About God’s Kingdom </em>at the Congregation Bible Study. This publication covers the book of Acts in such a way that the reader can feel the excitement of the fast-moving events recorded therein. Instead of providing a verse-by-verse commentary, the <em>Bearing Witness </em>book draws lessons from the accounts in Acts and helps us to see how we can make personal application.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Features of the Book: </strong>The introduction on <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009422/2">page 2</a> is a warm letter from the Governing Body expressing how they want us to benefit from this publication. Beginning with <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009043/1-30">chapter 2</a>, a focus line explains the thrust of each chapter and a Scripture citation indicates the portion of Acts that will be discussed. Many of the chapters contain informative boxes that offer background information about people, places, or events. Wide margins allow us to make notes. Throughout the book are richly detailed illustrations of Biblical scenes to help us visualize important events, and on the last page is a helpful image index to explain what is being depicted in various pictures. Inside the front and back covers are maps to assist us in following the progress of fellow worshippers in the first century as they began spreading the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>.</p>

Jesus “Takes Away the Sin of the World”
● John the Baptizer stated that Jesus “takes away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29) This drew attention to Jesus’ role in saving obedient mankind.
Why, though, did Jesus have to die to save sinners? What did he achieve by willingly giving up his life? Who benefits from his death? What can it mean for you?
Each year, Jehovah’s Witnesses gather to commemorate Jesus’ death on its anniversary. This year, the anniversary falls on Sunday, April 17, after sundown.
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to meet with them to examine the significance of Jesus’ death. The Bible’s answers to the above questions will be considered.
You may attend at a location nearest to your home. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Nicolle was a healthy little girl. But one evening she complained of a headache, and her parents took her to the hospital. The next evening, while still under observation, Nicolle suffered a heart attack. Further examinations revealed that she had a rare bacterial infection that had spread to her lungs, kidneys, and heart. Within 48 hours, Nicolle was dead. She was just three years old.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE death of a loved one is one of the most devastating experiences a human can face. At times, the loss may seem unbearable. “I miss Nicolle so much,” says Isabelle, the girl’s mother. “I miss her hugs, her smell, her tenderness. I miss the way she would give me a flower every day. Nicolle is always in my thoughts.”</p>

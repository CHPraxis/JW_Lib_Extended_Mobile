<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● John the Baptizer stated that Jesus “takes away the sin of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) This drew attention to Jesus’ role in saving obedient mankind.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Why, though, did Jesus have to die to save sinners? What did he achieve by willingly giving up his life? Who benefits from his death? What can it mean for you?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Each year, Jehovah’s Witnesses gather to commemorate Jesus’ death on its anniversary. This year, the anniversary falls on <strong>Sunday, April 17, </strong>after sundown.</p>

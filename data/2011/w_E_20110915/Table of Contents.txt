STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 7-15
When Jehovah told the Levites: “I am your share,” what did he mean? (Num. 18:20) Were the Levites the only ones who had that privilege? Can we today have Jehovah as our share? If so, how? These two study articles will examine the matter of how Jehovah can be one’s share.
STUDY ARTICLES 3, 4  PAGES 16-24

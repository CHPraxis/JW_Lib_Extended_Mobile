His Grandfather Had Just Died
● “I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” a man wrote to the Mexico branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, “but I find your magazines very interesting. One of them mentioned the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. This caught my attention. It so happens that my grandfather has just died. I would like eight of these brochures to distribute to my family to comfort them.”
The brochure When Someone You Love Dies contains answers to such questions as: How can I live with my grief? And what hope is there for those who have died? It presents the Bible’s explanation of both what death is and what the Bible says about the condition of the dead. It also discusses God’s promise, through Jesus Christ, of a resurrection to life on a cleansed paradise earth.

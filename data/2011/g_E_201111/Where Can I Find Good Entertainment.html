<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">If you’re a Christian, you’re selective about your entertainment. You don’t just settle for what <em>others </em>say you should watch, read, or listen to. Why not? Because much of today’s entertainment glorifies illicit sex, violence, and spiritism<wbr />—things you need to avoid. Nevertheless, there <em>is </em>good entertainment out there. Let’s see how you can find it.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Did you know . . . ? </strong>India often produces more than a thousand films a year<wbr />—many more than any other country.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>What to avoid. </strong>Many movies promote values that are contrary to Bible standards. Some feature graphic sex and violence, while others include supernatural themes. But the Bible says: “Put them all away from you, wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>) Furthermore, God condemns any acts that are associated with spiritism.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:18:10-5:18:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>How to be selective. </strong>“If the trailer doesn’t seem appropriate, I won’t watch the movie.”<wbr />—Jerrine.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<blockquote><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“If I’m watching a movie in the theater and I start to feel uncomfortable with the content, I will walk out.”<wbr />—Marina.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“To help me know more about content, I use an Internet site that reports the level of sex, violence, and profanity in each movie.”<wbr />—Natasha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Tip: </strong>Look for films that are <em>less likely </em>to contain objectionable material. “I thoroughly enjoy period pieces<wbr />—movies based on classic literature,” says a teen named Masami.</p>

</div>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>What to avoid. </strong>Similar to movies, many books promote values that are contrary to Bible standards. For example, some are sexually graphic or have spiritistic themes. But the Bible says: “Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3</a>) It also says that spiritistic acts are “bad in the eyes of Jehovah.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:17:17-12:17:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Kings 17:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>How to be selective. </strong>“When looking for a good book, I read the back cover and browse through the chapters. If I see anything objectionable, I don’t buy it.”<wbr />—Marie.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“As I grew up and began thinking for myself, I realized the importance of listening to my conscience. If I determined that a book was bad, I would stop reading it. I realized that it didn’t harmonize with God’s thinking.”<wbr />—Corinne.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong>Tip: </strong>Broaden your taste. “I find that I can get much more engrossed in classic literature than modern fiction,” says Lara, 17. “The wording, the character development, the plots<wbr />—they’re just fantastic!”</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><strong>What to avoid. </strong>Similar to movies and books, much music today is morally degrading. Explicit lyrics and graphic music videos can make it even more difficult for you to control your sexual urges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>) “Much of today’s music encourages behavior that is against Bible standards,” says 21-year-old Leigh, “and the beat makes people want to dance<wbr />—and not the polka.”</p>
<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div class="boxContent"><blockquote><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">  “Some music can cause us to become curious about things that we as Christians should abstain from.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><strong>How to be selective. </strong>“I ask myself, ‘If I were to let adult Christians scroll through my music list, would I be embarrassed by what they’d find?’ That helps to give me some perspective on the kind of music I should be listening to.”<wbr />—Leanne.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><strong>Tip. </strong>Be willing to try different genres. “My dad enjoys classical music, so I heard quite a bit of it as I was growing up,” says a teen named Roberto. “Learning about classical music<wbr />—while also learning to play the piano—<wbr />opened up a new world to me!”</p>

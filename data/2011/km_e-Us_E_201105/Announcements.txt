Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and Worship the Only True God may offer either of these books. Otherwise, offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation. July: Was Life Created? August: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?, and The Origin of Life—Five Questions Worth Asking.
▪ Since July has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

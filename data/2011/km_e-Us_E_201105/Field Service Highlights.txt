Field Service Highlights
In the month of December 2010, the Turks and Caicos Islands reported new all-time peaks of 278 publishers and 37 regular pioneers. Also, when compared with the same month last year, the United States saw increases of 2.7 percent in total publishers, 6.8 percent in regular pioneers, and 4.5 percent in auxiliary pioneers. Bermuda also had increases of 2.5 percent in total publishers and 40 percent in auxiliary pioneers. Truly, a great shout of praise ascends to our heavenly Father.—Ps. 95:1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This form should be filled out when you find an interested person who does not live in your territory or who speaks a foreign language. Though in the past we used it when meeting people who speak a foreign language whether they demonstrated interest or not, we now use it only when the person demonstrates interest. The only exception is if the person is deaf. If we meet someone who is deaf, regardless of whether he demonstrates interest, we should fill out an S-43 form.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What should we do with the form after it is filled out? We should give it to the congregation secretary. If he knows which congregation to send it to, he may simply forward it to the elders of that congregation so that they can arrange to care for the interest. If he cannot determine the congregation, he will forward the form to the branch office.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If the interested person speaks a foreign language and lives in your territory, you may continue calling on him to cultivate the interest until he is contacted by a publisher from the appropriate foreign-language congregation.<wbr />—See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:202009405/5:78-8">November 2009 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>page 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What do we have the privilege to share?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>From dawn till dusk, the beauty of visible light brings praise to Jehovah God. Yet, it was another kind of light that Jesus invited his disciples to possess<wbr />—“the light of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:12-43:8:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:12</a>) Possessing this spiritual enlightenment is a special privilege that includes serious responsibilities. Jesus instructed: “Let your light shine before men,” thereby benefiting others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 5:16</a>) Amid today’s deep spiritual darkness, this light must be shared, and the need has never been greater! How can we, like Christ, let our light shine?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How did Jesus show the importance of sharing spiritual light?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>By Preaching: </strong>Jesus used his time, energy, and resources to make the light of truth known to people in their homes, in public squares, on the mountaintops<wbr />—wherever they could be found. He recognized the lasting value of providing true spiritual enlightenment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:12:46-43:12:46" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 12:46</a>) To reach even more people, Jesus prepared his disciples to be “the light of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:14-40:5:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14</a>) They let their light shine by doing good to their neighbors and by sharing spiritual truths.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How can we demonstrate genuine appreciation for the light of truth?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>God’s people take seriously the responsibility to “go on walking as children of light,” and they preach wherever people can be found. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:8-49:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 5:8</a>) Simply reading the Bible or other Christian publications in public view during a work or school break can open the way for a Scriptural discussion. In this way, one young sister started a Bible study and placed books with 12 of her classmates!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why does ‘letting our light shine’ include exemplary conduct?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>By Fine Works: </strong>Letting our light shine also involves our daily conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:9-49:5:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 5:9</a>) At work, at school, and in other public areas, Christian conduct stands out and creates opportunities to share Bible truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) For example, the good behavior of one five-year-old boy moved his teacher to call his parents. She said, “Never have I seen a child with such a strong sense of morality!” Yes, our ministry and fine conduct attract people to “the light of life” and bring praise to our God.</p>

The place where they laid him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:16:6-41:16:6" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mark 16:6</a>) Later, on the day of Pentecost of the year 33, the apostle Peter talked to a large group of people in Jerusalem about David’s prophecy in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:16:0-19:16:11" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 16</a>.

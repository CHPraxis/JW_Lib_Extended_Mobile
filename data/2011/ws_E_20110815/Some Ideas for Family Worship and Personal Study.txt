Some Ideas for Family Worship and Personal Study
SINCE the beginning of 2009, the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses began meeting just one evening each week instead of two evenings. Because of this change, the Governing Body encouraged us to use one evening a week for family worship or personal study. Have you been using this time well? What you choose to do during this evening can help you and your family very much.
What should we study during our family worship? The Governing Body does not tell families what they should study every week. Every family has different needs. So the head of the family should think about what his family needs and decide what will help them the most. Individuals can also decide how they can use this time in the best way.
Some families prepare for congregation meetings together. But this is not the only thing that we can do for family worship. Some families read the Bible or some information from our publications and discuss it together. Others prepare a drama about a story in the Bible. This is especially beneficial for young children. So our family worship does not need to be like a meeting in the congregation, where we read paragraphs and ask questions. The time for family worship should be a time when we can talk and say what is in our heart. It is a time when we can use our imagination and have interesting conversations about the things we read in the Bible. In this way, the evenings together as a family will be a happy time for everyone.
One father of three children wrote to explain what his family does for family worship. He has a daughter, Kaitlyn, and two sons, David and Michael. Kaitlyn is 15 years old, David is 13, and Michael is 7. For family worship, the family often uses the chapters from the Bible reading for that week. First everyone reads the chapters. Then the children choose something that they would like to study more about. Later they tell their parents what they learned. Michael often draws a picture or writes something about what he reads. Sometimes David and Kaitlyn write about a story in the Bible as if they were watching what was happening. For example, one week the family read in Genesis chapter 40 about the time when Joseph explained to two of Pharaoh’s slaves what their dreams meant. And Kaitlyn wrote about this as if she were a prisoner watching what was happening.
This is just an example of what families can do during their family worship. Because everyone is different, each person or family can decide what is best for them. The box in this article gives some other ideas of things we can do during family worship or personal study. You can probably think of many other ideas too.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IT IS nighttime, and some shepherds are in the fields, caring for their sheep. Suddenly Jehovah’s angel stands next to them, and a bright light shines all around them! They are afraid, but they listen to the exciting news that the angel tells them: “Have no fear, for, look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have, because there was born to you today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” The baby that the angel is talking about is the one who will be the Christ, or Messiah. The angel tells the shepherds that they can find this baby in a manger in a nearby town. Then suddenly many angels appear. They praise Jehovah: “Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:8-42:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:8-14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:29:5-2:29:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 29:5-7</a>) But how could these shepherds and others learn more and know that Jehovah had chosen this baby to be the Messiah? First, they needed to study the prophecies in the Scriptures about the Messiah, and then they needed to see if these prophecies came true during the life of this child.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Many years later, John the Baptist started his preaching work.

The prophecy says: “There are seventy weeks that have been determined upon your people . . . From the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24, 25</a>) Bible experts agree that these are not weeks of days but weeks of years.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In the Bible, there are many other prophecies about the Messiah. We will learn about some of them in this article. They are prophecies about his birth, his life as a child and as an adult, and his ministry. We will learn about how these prophecies came true during the life of Jesus. This will make our faith in the Bible stronger and also prove that Jesus was the Messiah whom people were waiting for.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PROPHECIES ABOUT HIS EARLY LIFE</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6. How did the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a> come true?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>The Messiah would be from the tribe of Judah in Israel. </strong>Just before Jacob died, he blessed his sons, and to Judah he said: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a>) Jewish teachers always believed that Jacob’s words to Judah were about the Messiah. But what do Jacob’s words mean? We know that he is talking about a king because the scepter and commander’s staff were rods carried by a king to show that he had the right to rule and to give commands. So this prophecy shows that the king, the one with the right to rule, had to come from the tribe of Judah. The first king from Judah was King David, and Zedekiah was the last king from Judah on earth. But Jacob’s prophecy talked about another king after Zedekiah. That king would be king forever. He is called Shiloh, which means he is “the one to whom <strong>it belongs.” </strong>God told Zedekiah that this king is the one who has the legal right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:21:26-26:21:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:26, 27</a>) Before Jesus was born, the angel Gabriel told Mary: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Jesus was from the tribe of Judah and from the family of David. And after Zedekiah, Jesus was the only person in the family of David to whom Jehovah promised the right to be king. So Shiloh must <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>be Jesus Christ.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:1-40:1:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:6-40:1:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Luke 3:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:31-42:3:34" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 31-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. How did the prophecy about the birth of the Messiah come true?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong>The Messiah would be born in a place called Bethlehem. </strong>The prophet Micah wrote: “You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah, from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel, whose origin is from early times, from the days of time indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a>) The prophecy tells us that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. This was a town in Judah that was once called Ephrathah. But Mary, the mother of Jesus, and her husband, Joseph, lived in a different town <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>called Nazareth. When it was close to the time for Jesus to be born, the ruler of Rome told people to return to the city where their father was born to register their names. So Mary and Joseph went back to Bethlehem, where Mary gave birth to Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:1-40:2:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:5-40:2:6" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>) So the birth of Jesus happened exactly as the prophecy said!</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">8, 9. What does the prophecy say about the birth of the Messiah? What would happen after the Messiah was born?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>A virgin, or maiden, would give birth to the Messiah. (Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 7:14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This verse says that the maiden would give birth to a son. The word for virgin in Hebrew is <em>bethulah. </em>This verse uses <em>almah, </em>a word that means “maiden.” But we know that <em>almah </em>also means “virgin” because the Bible calls Rebekah a maiden (<em>almah</em>) before her marriage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:24:16-1:24:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 24:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:24:43-1:24:43" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 43</a>) God’s holy spirit directed Matthew to write that <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:14</a> came true when Jesus was born. In this verse, he did not use the Greek word for “maiden.” He used the Greek word for “virgin,” <em>parthenos. </em>The Gospel writers Matthew and Luke both say that Mary was a virgin and that she became pregnant through God’s holy spirit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:18-40:1:25" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 1:18-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:26-42:1:35" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 1:26-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><strong>After the Messiah was born, children would be murdered. </strong>This is similar to what happened hundreds of years before the Messiah was born.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:22-2:1:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 1:22</a>) A prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:15-24:31:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:15, 16</a> talks about “Rachel weeping over her sons” because enemies took them away. People heard the sound of her crying far away in Ramah, which was in Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><strong>The Messiah would be brought out of Egypt. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/28:11:1-28:11:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hosea 11:1</a>) To save Jesus from King Herod, an angel told Joseph and Mary to leave Israel and take Jesus to Egypt. They stayed there until Herod died. After Herod died, Joseph brought Jesus back to Israel.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>THE MESSIAH BEGINS HIS MINISTRY!</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. Who prepared the way for the Messiah?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup><strong>A messenger would prepare the way for the Messiah. </strong>Malachi said that someone would come before the Messiah to prepare the way for him. He would help people to be ready to accept the Messiah when he appeared.

God wanted people to know who the Messiah was. So it was God who chose John to do a work that was like the work of Elijah and prepare the people to welcome the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. What special work did God give the Messiah to do?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><strong>God would give the Messiah a special work to do. </strong>One day Jesus was in the synagogue in Nazareth, the town where he grew up. Jesus opened a scroll and read the words of Isaiah. This is what he read: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” Jesus said that this prophecy was about him. He really was the Messiah. That is why Jesus had the right to say: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:16-42:4:21" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. What did Isaiah say about Jesus’ ministry in Galilee?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><strong>One prophecy tells us about the Messiah’s ministry in Galilee. </strong>Isaiah prophesied about “Zebulun” and “Naphtali” and “Galilee of the nations.” He wrote: “The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light. As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:9:1-23:9:2" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>) Jesus began his ministry in Galilee, in the town called Capernaum. He also taught in the areas of Zebulun and Naphtali. Jesus helped the people in these places by teaching them truths that shone like a great light. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:12-40:4:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 4:12-16</a>) It was in Galilee that Jesus gave his Sermon on the Mount, chose his apostles, and performed his first miracle. It was also here in Galilee that Jesus appeared to more than 500 disciples after his resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:1-40:7:27" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 5:1–7:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:16-40:28:20" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 28:16-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:3:13-41:3:14" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Mark 3:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:2:8-43:2:11" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> John 2:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:6-46:15:6" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) So Isaiah’s prophecy came true when Jesus preached in “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali.” Jesus also preached the good news about the Kingdom in other places in Israel.</p>

What Is God’s Kingdom?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
 1. What is God’s Kingdom?
The Kingdom of God is a heavenly government. It will replace all other governments and will cause God’s will to be done in heaven and on earth. So God’s Kingdom is the solution to our need for good government.—Read Daniel 2:44; Matthew 6:9, 10.
A kingdom must have a king. Jehovah appointed his Son, Jesus, to be the King of His Kingdom.—Read Luke 1:30-33.
 2. Why is Jesus the ideal Ruler?
God’s Son is the ideal King because he is kind, firm for what is right, and powerful enough to help people. (Matthew 11:28-30) After he was resurrected, Jesus ascended to heaven and began to wait at Jehovah’s right hand. (Hebrews 10:12, 13) Finally, God gave him power to begin ruling from heaven.—Read Daniel 7:13, 14.
 3. Who else will rule with Jesus?
A group called “the holy ones” are chosen by God to rule with Jesus in heaven. (Daniel 7:27) The first prospective holy ones chosen were Jesus’ faithful apostles. Jehovah has continued to select faithful men and women as holy ones until now. Like Jesus, they are resurrected with a spiritual body.—Read John 14:1-3; 1 Corinthians 15:42-45.
How many people go to heaven? Jesus called them a “little flock.” (Luke 12:32) They will finally number 144,000, and they will rule over the earth with Jesus.—Read Revelation 5:9, 10; 14:1.
 4. When did God’s Kingdom start ruling?
Jesus became King in 1914.a Shortly afterward, he threw Satan and his demons down to the earth. (Revelation 12:7-10, 12) Since then, mankind’s troubles have severely increased. Wars, earthquakes, famines, epidemics, and lawlessness are part of a sign that the present system of things is in its last days. (2 Timothy 3:1-5) All who want to benefit from God’s Kingdom should learn how to become followers of the King, Jesus.—Read Luke 21:7, 10, 11, 31, 34, 35.
 5. What does God’s Kingdom accomplish?
By means of a global preaching work, God’s Kingdom is already helping millions from all nations to learn God’s ways. (Matthew 24:14) It will protect “a great crowd” of Jesus’ loyal subjects when it destroys the present wicked system of things on earth.—Read Revelation 7:9, 10, 13-17.
During a period of 1,000 years, the Kingdom will gradually make the earth a paradise. Finally, Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. (1 Corinthians 15:24-26) Do you know someone whom you would like to tell about God’s Kingdom?—Read Psalm 37:10, 11, 29.

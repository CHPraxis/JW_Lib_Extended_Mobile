<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sm"> <strong>1. What is God’s Kingdom?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Kingdom of God is a heavenly government. It will replace all other governments and will cause God’s will to be done in heaven and on earth. So God’s Kingdom is the solution to our need for good government.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Daniel 2:44;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> <em>Matthew 6:9, 10</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A kingdom must have a king. Jehovah appointed his Son, Jesus, to be the King of His Kingdom.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Luke 1:30-33</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sm"> <strong>2. Why is Jesus the ideal Ruler?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God’s Son is the ideal King because he is kind, firm for what is right, and powerful enough to help people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30</a>) After he was resurrected, Jesus ascended to heaven and began to wait at Jehovah’s right hand.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sm"> <strong>3. Who else will rule with Jesus?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A group called “the holy ones” are chosen by God to rule with Jesus in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 7:27</a>) The first prospective holy ones chosen were Jesus’ faithful apostles.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">How many people go to heaven? Jesus called them a “little flock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 12:32</a>) They will finally number 144,000, and they will rule over the earth with Jesus.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><em>Revelation 5:9, 10;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> <em>14:1</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Wars, earthquakes, famines, epidemics, and lawlessness are part of a sign that the present system of things is in its last days.

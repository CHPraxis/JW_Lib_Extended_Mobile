Purpose of Study Articles
STUDY ARTICLES 1, 2  PAGES 7-15
The first article discusses the responsibility that each member of the Christian family has in keeping spiritually awake. The second article considers how keeping a simple eye, pursuing spiritual goals, and maintaining a Family Worship evening are essential to the entire family’s spiritual well-being.
STUDY ARTICLE 3  PAGES 16-20
Jehovah should be the most important Person in the life of his servants. This article highlights the lessons we learn about this from what happened to the first woman, Eve; the faithful man Job; and the perfect Son of God, Jesus Christ.
STUDY ARTICLE 4  PAGES 21-25
In Romans chapter 11, the apostle Paul speaks of a symbolic olive tree. What do the various features of that tree represent? As we examine their meaning in this article, not only will we learn more about Jehovah’s purpose but we will also be amazed by the depth of his wisdom.
STUDY ARTICLE 5  PAGES 28-32
This article discusses Psalms 3 and 4, composed by King David. These inspired songs show that we can act with confidence if we pray for Jehovah’s help and we trust in him completely. That is what David did when faced with adversities, such as the treachery of his son Absalom.

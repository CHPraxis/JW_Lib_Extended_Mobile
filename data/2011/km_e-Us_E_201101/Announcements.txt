Announcements
▪ Literature offer for January: What Does the Bible Really Teach? If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and Worship the Only True God may offer either of these books. Otherwise, publishers may offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation. February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? Publishers may also offer The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? or The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. April: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ Starting in February, the new public talk for the circuit overseers will be “How Does the Truth Affect Your Life?”
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning on Friday, May 13, 2011. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on this day.

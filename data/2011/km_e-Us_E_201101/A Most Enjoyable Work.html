<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What work of spiritual healing is occurring in our day?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Great joy filled the hearts of those who witnessed physical healing in the first century. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:24-42:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 5:24-26</a>) In our day, we rejoice in the work of spiritual healing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 22:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 17</a>) How exciting it is to read experiences in which Jehovah’s Word and holy spirit transform the lives of individuals! Even more rewarding, however, is <em>participating </em>in this work by conducting a progressive Bible study.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. What joy may we experience as we teach someone the truth?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What is God’s name? Why does he permit suffering? What will God’s Kingdom do for mankind? We find pleasure not only in answering such questions but also in seeing the joy radiate from the student when he learns the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:23-20:15:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 15:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 24:32</a>) As a student progresses, he may begin to use Jehovah’s name, make changes in his dress and grooming, shed harmful practices, and start witnessing to others. If he progresses to dedication and baptism, he will become our brother and fellow worker. Each of these positive steps is a reason to rejoice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:19-52:2:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. What practical steps can we take to start a Bible study?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Can You Have a Share? </strong>If you would like to participate in this most enjoyable work, ask Jehovah for the privilege of conducting a Bible study, and then work in harmony with your prayers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>) Preach where and when people can be found. Offer a Bible study on every appropriate occasion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:11:6-21:11:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:6</a>) When you find interest and plant a seed of truth, return to water it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:3:6-46:3:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we offer Bible studies with a sense of urgency?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Countless people yet remain who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Who will help to fill their spiritual need by conducting a Bible study with them? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:6-40:5:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Let us offer ourselves willingly to help complete the preaching and disciple-making work before the harvest comes to an end.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8</a>.</p>
